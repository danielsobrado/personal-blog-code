The December 17 list caught my dogcatcher eye because all but one were dividend payers. And I had already featured picks by Bloomberg and Fortune in other articles. When Kiplinger Today focused on Forever stocks online December 21 this article was born. Lately, readers and other contributors have questioned the intent, purpose, validity, and usefulness of my various stock lists. Here\\'s a case where a tradition is established to verify that any list of stocks in which most pay dividends is fair game for doggish analysis. Below are the top ten \\'safer\\' dividends chosen equities blessed by Barron\\'s December 17 and the dozen stocks to hold forever advocated by Kiplinger revealed December 21. Of course, Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Alphabet\\'s (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) dividends will always be safe because they pay none. They can\\'t pay less. Source: YCharts \\n\\n\\n  Actionable Conclusions (1-10): Brokers Predicted 32.48% To 55.81% Net Gains From Top Ten \\'Safer\\' Dividend Barron\\'s 10 2019 Favorites Vs. Kiplinger 12 Forever Picks  Six of these ten top \\'safer\\' Barron\\'s/Kiplinger stocks were from Barron\\'s, three were Kiplinger, and one was listed in both. The following probable profit-generating trades were identified by estimated dividend returns from $1,000 invested in each highest yielding stock. The dividend along with aggregate one-year analyst median target prices, as reported by YCharts, created the 2018-2019 data. Ten probable profit-generating trades projected to December 21, 2019, were: Amazon.com Inc. was projected to net $558.11 based on no dividends just the median of target prices from forty-five analysts, less broker fees. The Beta number showed this estimate subject to volatility 70% more than the market as a whole. Apple Inc. (AAPL) was projected to net $471.59 based on dividends plus a median target upside estimated from forty-four analysts, less broker fees. The Beta number showed this estimate subject to volatility 20% over the market as a whole. Bank of America Corporation (BAC) was projected to net $466.25 based on a median target price estimate from twenty-nine analysts plus annual dividend, less broker fees. The Beta number showed this estimate subject to volatility 27% over the market as a whole. Delta Air Lines Inc. (DAL) netted $413.66 per the median of twenty-one analysts estimates plus dividends, less broker fees. The Beta number showed this estimate subject to volatility 7% over the market as a whole. Altria Group Inc. (MO) was projected to net $375.21 based on dividends plus a mean target price estimate from eighteen analysts, less broker fees. The Beta number showed this estimate subject to volatility 7% less than the market as a whole. Chevron Corp. (CVX) netted $366.84 based on a median target price estimate from twenty-five analysts plus dividends, less broker fees. The Beta number showed this estimate subject to volatility 13% more than the market as a whole.\\n Caterpillar Inc. (CAT) was projected to net $363.70 based on the median of target price estimates from twenty-seven analysts plus dividends, less broker fees. The Beta number showed this estimate subject to volatility 61% over the market as a whole. Alphabet Inc. was projected to net $346.15 based on a median of target price estimates from forty-five brokers plus the projected annual dividend, less broker fees. The Beta number showed this estimate subject to volatility 6% over the market as a whole. BlackRock Inc. (BLK) was projected to net $327.96 based on dividends plus a median target estimate from sixteen brokers, less broker fees. The Beta number showed this estimate subject to volatility 56% more than the market as a whole. JPMorgan Chase & Co (JPM) was projected to net $324.82 based on a median of target price estimates from twenty-nine brokers plus the projected annual dividend, less broker fees. The Beta number showed this estimate subject to volatility 10% more than the market as a whole. The average net gain in dividend and price was estimated at 40.14% on $10k invested as $1k in each of these ten stocks. This gain estimate was subject to volatility 33% more than the market as a whole.

So, the highest yielding stocks in any collection have become affectionately known as \"dogs.\" More precisely, these are, in fact, best called, \"underdogs\". Eight Sectors Were Represented By December Barron\\'s/Kiplinger Listed \\'Safer\\' Dividend Stocks\\n Of eleven sectors, eight were represented by the 17 stocks with past year positive returns and current cash margins greater than their announced annual dividends. The count of 17 \\'safer\\' dividend Barron\\'s/Kiplinger equities by sector showed: consumer defensive (1), energy (1), real estate (1), financial services (3), healthcare (3), industrials (4), technology (2), consumer cyclical 2), basic materials (0), communication services (0), and utilities (0). Source: YCharts \\n\\n \\n\\n Periodic Safety Check A previous article discussed the attributes of the 10 Barron\\'s 2019 Favorites vs. Kiplinger Today\\'s \"12 Stocks You Should Never Sell.\" You see below the tinted green list that passed the dividend \"stress\" test. These 17 Barron\\'s/Kiplinger stocks report positive annual returns and sufficient cash flow yield to cover their anticipated dividend yield, the margin of cash flow excess being shown in the boldface \"Safety Margin\" column. One of the 22 was disqualified by negative one-year returns; two paid no dividends. Four were discarded with free cash flow yields less than their dividend yields. Source: YCharts \\n\\n\\n Corporate cash flow, however, is easily re-directed by any board of directors managing company policy. Directors can cancel or vary the payout of dividends to shareholders. For example, Altria Group Inc., top dog on the list above, cut their quarterly dividend from $0.75 to $0.29 in 2008, raised the Q stipend to $0.32 in 2009 and to $0.34 in 2010. Altria Group Q dividends have since risen annually to their present $0.80 in 2018, where they currently stand. Three additional columns of reported cash data listed after the safety margin figures on the charts above, reveal payout ratios (lower is better), total annual returns, dividend growth, and P/E ratio levels for each stock. This data is provided to reach beyond yield to select reliable payout stocks. The one-year total returns column above showed one stock exhibiting tumbling returns. Yield Metrics Uncovered Significant Price Advantages For 5 Low-Price Barron\\'s/Kiplinger 2019 \\'Safer\\' Dividend Stocks Ten \\'safer\\' dividend top Barron\\'s/Kiplinger stocks for December 21 per YCharts data ranked themselves by yield as follows: Source: YCharts \\n\\n Ten top \\'safer\\' Barron\\'s/Kiplinger 2019 dividend paying stocks were culled by Yield (dividend/price). Results were verified by Yahoo Finance.  Actionable Conclusions: Analysts Concluded 5 Lowest-Priced of Top Ten High Yield Barron\\'s/ Kiplinger \\'Safer\\' Dividend Stocks Would Deliver (11) 30.56% Vs. (12) 27.33% Net Gains for All Ten by December 2019  Source: YCharts \\n\\n\\n $5,000 invested as $1k in each of the five lowest priced stocks in the top ten Barron\\'s/Kiplinger 2019 Kennel by yield were predicted by analyst one-year targets to deliver 11.81% more net gain than $5,000 invested as $.5k in each of all ten. The second lowest priced Delta Air Lines Inc. was projected to deliver the best net gain of 41.37%. Ten Barron\\'s/Kiplinger \\'Safer\\' Dividend Picks Saw 11.81% More Gain From 5 Highest Yield, Lowest Priced Stocks Source: YCharts \\n\\n Lowest priced five Barron\\'s/Kiplinger \\'safer\\' dividend stocks as of December 21 were: Altria Group Inc., Delta Air Lines Inc., Realty Income Corp. (O), JPMorgan Chase & Co., and Chevron Corp., with prices ranging from $49.09 to $104.21. Higher priced five Barron\\'s/Kiplinger \\'safer\\' dividend stocks as of December 21 were: Caterpillar Inc., Johnson & Johnson (JNJ), Amgen Inc. (AMGN), 3M Co (MMM), and BlackRock Inc., whose prices ranged from $120.07 to $369.16. This distinction between five low-priced dividend dogs and the general field of ten reflect the \"basic method\" Michael B. O\\'Higgins employed for beating the Dow. The added scale of projected gains based on analyst targets contributed a unique element of \"market sentiment\" gauging upside potential. It provided a here and now equivalent of waiting a year to find out what might happen in the market. It\\'s also the work analysts got paid big bucks to do. Caution is advised, however, as analysts are historically 20% to 80% accurate on the direction of change and about 0% to 20% accurate on the degree of the change.

      "{'article_name': 'Unmixed Signals', 'time': None, 'symbol': None, 'class': None, 'company_name': None, 'bus_desc': None, 'summary': '', 'article': 'In mid-December, the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) published its regular quarterly update. It was just in time for the current bout of \"overseas turmoil\" which included a lot that wasn\\'t overseas. The BIS noticed I\\'m sure reluctantly. Financial markets swung widely, eventually netting a sharp correction, during the period under review, which started in mid-September. Asset prices fell across the board and US government yields widened in October before retracing that increase and dropping further as the selloff of risk assets spread. Volatility and term premia jumped. A further round of turbulence, this time accompanied by lower yields, hit markets in December. The anticipated BOND ROUT!!!! of normalcy further postponed. The wild swings in markets would only get wilder following the publishing of the report. This wasn\\'t supposed to happen, not in 2018. Globally synchronized growth was going to carry the global economy if not all the way back to pre-crisis conditions than at least somewhere close enough to them. Raw disappointment oozing out from each of their words, the BIS continued: The repricing took place amid mixed signals from global economic activity and the gradual, yet persistent, tightening of financial conditions. When any official, political outfit characterizes anything as \"mixed signals from the global economy\" they don\\'t actually mean mixed. The correct word to have used in this context would have been contradictory. They mean \"mixed\" in the sense that the evidence is increasingly going the other way which doesn\\'t comport with the hugely optimistic standard narrative. The data is negative, but the narrative remains positive nonetheless. That kind of \"mixed.\" \\n\\n\\n The title of their summary is, after all, Yet More Bumps On The Path To Normal. If they mean \"normal\" in that the global economy can never really get going because it lurches from downturn to low-grade upturn and back again, then, yes, that\\'s what we have in front of us here. Eurodollar normal. They don\\'t mean that version, however. Economists really think the world is getting better rather than falling off again. It doesn\\'t matter how many times they think it, say it, print it, it never happens. They mean \"normal\" in the small \"e\" economic sense, and thus will be surprised as well as sorely disappointed by exactly what the oil market is saying on the topic. An oil crash is never a good thing. A 40% decline in oil prices spread out over a two-year period would be a huge boon to consumers; in two months, it\\'s nothing other than panicky liquidation which points to the same familiar if undesirable direction. That\\'s because it comes along when the data has become pretty homogenous really. The latest are more estimates out of China where downturn is perhaps closest at hand. Industrial profits, an important indication of economic progress, contracted in November (year over year) for the first time since 2015. \\n\\n Just as there is a space between recession and growth, there is one between reflation\\'s end and downturn. It\\'s here where the data might\\'ve been mixed, but as the calendar progresses toward 2018\\'s turn, it has been much less so. Whatever might\\'ve been possible before, say, May 29, really doesn\\'t seem the slightest bit likely any longer. After October 3? \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n That\\'s what markets are now pricing - what the final end of Reflation #3 means. It leads nowhere good, the same economy as the last eleven years of lost decades and stubborn malaise. If China is rolling or has rolled over, then what\\'s in front is only downside. \\n\\n\\n\\n As Chinese industry goes, so does the Chinese economy, and therefore, what\\'s left of globally synchronized growth. It was always more of a pipe dream than anything, but after so much time without actual growth in the world that was enough for many people. A lot them really thought this time, it had to be the one. Imagine what would happen when they find out it isn\\'t and won\\'t be, no upside left after gaining not much to begin with. Unfortunately, we don\\'t have to imagine, the \"mixed signals\" of plunging markets are already doing it for us.\\n'}\n",

      "{'article_name': 'Twitter: All Trends Point Toward A #Turnaround', 'time': None, 'symbol': None, 'class': None, 'company_name': None, 'bus_desc': None, 'summary': \"Twitter experiencing a turnaround after years of struggle, represents a compelling opportunity for investors.Company is cheap relative to its tremendous cultural importance as well as competitor Facebook.Less sensitive to the looming threat of data regulation legislature due to public nature of platform.Positioned to benefit from advertisers getting crowded out of Facebook and Google as digital advertising industry becomes more competitive.Ability to achieve significant MAU and DAU growth uncertain, dependent on company's vision and execution moving forward.\", 'article': 'David Einhorn\\'s latest letter to his partners in Greenlight Capital revealed that he closed out his position in Twitter (TWTR) for a tidy gain of 78% (a disclosure that can be found after sifting through several pages of an Einhorn assault on Tesla and CEO Elon Musk). Although his signature hedge fund has underperformed the S&P 500 in recent years, Einhorn\\'s cumulative track record of 15.4% annualized over 22 years, net of fees and expenses, is still one of the best in the business. The market has dropped since Einhorn sold his position in Twitter, Twitter has dropped even more, and today\\'s investors can buy Twitter closer to the price at which he bought the stock than the price at which he sold. Should they? I find Twitter to be an interesting opportunity given the massive disparity between the company\\'s enormous cultural relevance and its surprisingly small market cap relative to other technology stocks, which was one of the factors that drove Einhorn\\'s original investment thesis. Twitter is the most widely used and widely referenced publicly traded social media company next to Facebook (FB), yet it only has an enterprise value of about 5% of Facebook\\'s. Unlike Facebook, its popularity among young people isn\\'t experiencing a secular decline. Unlike Snapchat (SNAP), its core product isn\\'t enormously pressured by a deep-pocketed competitor like Instagram that may very likely put the company entirely out of business.\\n After years of posting losses, Twitter will report its first time ever trailing 12 month profit this year. Today\\'s investors can buy in at about the same price as the $26 IPO in 2013, but today\\'s Twitter is a much healthier company financially than it was five years ago. With co-founder Jack Dorsey back at the helm, 8 consecutive quarters of earnings estimate beats, growing ad engagements and declining engagement costs, and continued free publicity from being the social media platform of choice for the sitting U.S. President, all signs point towards a turnaround for Twitter. Some have expressed justifiable reservations about Dorsey serving as chief executive for two publicly traded companies simultaneously, but there\\'s no question that he is deeply committed to Twitter. He gave away a third of his Twitter shares, worth nearly $200 million, back to employees to boost morale when he first returned. Unlike Alphabet\\'s Larry Page, he actually showed up at the Senate Intelligence Committee hearing this summer despite Twitter being a fraction of Alphabet\\'s size. Whether Dorsey will be as effective as shareholders hope remains to be seen, but there is no question that his heart is in the right place. On the topic of congressional hearings: Twitter, as a platform for public interaction, is unique among its technology peers for being partially insulated against the dark cloud of potential data privacy regulations looming in the horizon. Twitter users, unlike Facebook users, don\\'t sign up for the service with an expectation of privacy: the whole point of the platform is to broadcast your thoughts to the world. Although no one knows what shape or form any future data regulation laws will take, Twitter\\'s business should adapt to a harsher regulatory environment better than competitors. There is currently a lot of misguided public outrage over Facebook selling user data that stems from a fundamental misunderstanding of how Facebook the company works, but Twitter actually does sell your data, and everyone is fine with it. A full 14% of Twitter\\'s revenues, worth $333 million the previous fiscal year, come from its data licensing operation which gives partners access to data from its public feed. Twitter\\'s monetization of its public data offers partners a unique product in the social media space, and investors a competitive advantage to supplement its core advertising business.\\n Digital advertising is a high growth industry, both in absolute dollar terms and as a share of total global ad spend. As a second tier digital ad company, Twitter is positioned to benefit from spillover effects as competition within the Google-Facebook duopoly becomes more crowded and advertisers\\' returns on investment drop due to higher engagement costs, pay-per-click bidding wars, and a growing supply of advertising dollars chasing the same amount of user attention. For advertisers, your partner\\'s brand doesn\\'t matter all that much; getting a click is far more important than where that click comes from. Google and Facebook reigned supreme during the initial wave of digital advertising growth, but as the industry matures, competitive forces will naturally drive businesses to alternative platforms with lower costs and higher ROI, a trend that can bring a lot of customers to Twitter\\'s doorstep independent of any marketing efforts from the company itself. Should Twitter investors expect significant monthly and daily active user growth? Not necessarily. For such a cultural behemoth, Twitter\\'s user base is relatively small, clocking in at 326 million MAUs as of the latest quarterly report, with only 67 million in the US. It\\'s easy to fall prey to the availability heuristic bias and overestimate Twitter\\'s relevance to the average person due to its disproportionate representation in the media. Twitter\\'s trend-driven microblogging service makes it the platform of choice for journalists, celebrities, politicians, and people with lots of opinions they want to express (like investment writers!). This means it\\'s used by a very vocal minority ... but a minority nonetheless. For the average person whose social media interactions are mostly confined within their real life social circles, Facebook is a necessity to stay connected and Twitter is that app they frequently see in the news and in memes, but don\\'t use themselves. A 2015 Wired article written by \"an actual teen\" reported that most teenagers \"simply do not understand the point of Twitter,\" a problem that persists today among all age groups given Twitter\\'s ongoing onboarding struggles. The opportunity for improvement exists, but it\\'s important to recognize that while Twitter is the only notable player in a niche space, it is still a niche space, one that is susceptible to social usage trends in either direction and where growth is not guaranteed.\\n Is Twitter worth buying at today\\'s price? Einhorn bought Twitter under the rationale that it was underpriced at 2% of Facebook\\'s market cap. As Twitter has grown more expensive and Facebook significantly cheaper, that number today is closer to 4-5% depending on whether you choose to back out cash holdings. In the current market, I still prefer Facebook. But Twitter still remains a solid pick with great prospects, especially for investors who don\\'t like Facebook, and worth watching for all investors. Either a large downward movement in price or a significant improvement in business execution would warrant a buy. Twitter is far from a traditional value stock, being naturally a bit of a risky play due to its rich price-earnings ratio (in the 60s after normalizing for tax shenanigans), but overall I believe the company is moving in the right direction and the stock has a lot of potential for market-beating returns. In addition to organically increasing ad revenue, possible catalysts for growth include more effective monetization of its user base, platform improvements to make the service more relevant to the average consumer, and of course, its continued existence as a potential M&A target for one of the FAANGs (my money is on Google if an acquisition actually happens). With its bottom line finally out of the red and into the black, Twitter has turned a crucial corner, and time is now on its side.\\nDisclosure: I am/we are long FB.

At the time of writing, active front-month futures are trading around $0.72, down more than 9%, from $0.78 at the beginning of 2018. Currently, I expect prices to trade around $0.70 to $0.80 for the next few months. Buying the dip on low and selling into any short-term rally may be the best way to play the cotton market. Before we get into the details, let's travel briefly back in time to 2011 and revisit the story of how cotton reached its all-time high with my fellow readers. Prior to the 2010/2011 season, world cotton ending stocks had suffered several years of consecutive decline. Global cotton ending stocks fell from 62,987 (1,000 480lb Bales) in the 2006/2007 season to 46,197 (1,000 480lb Bales) by the end of 2009/2010 season. Stock-to-use ratio fell from 53% to a dangerously low 39%.   Year Beginning Stock Production Dom. Consumption Ending Stock Stock-to-Use ratio   2006/07 61,906 122,685 122,493 62,987 51%   2007/08 62,987 120,049 121,743 61,878 50%   2008/09 61,878 108,069 108,860 61,453 56%   2009/10 61,453 103,084 119,482 46,179 39%   2010/11 46,179 117,298 115,611 49,263 43%   Source: USDA Cotton World Market and Trade Report ; (1,000 480lb Bales) During the season, Pakistan suffered one of its worst floods in recent history. Some ready cotton crops were reportedly destroyed. India, the world's second largest cotton exporter at the time, placed export restrictions due to rising domestic prices. Australia was also reportedly suffering from floods and unfavorable weather, and production figures were expected to be low. In October 2010, the USDA cut cotton production and stock estimates for China and cotton prices immediately reacted. The already expensive cotton rallied from $1.00s early October 2010 to $2.20s March 2011, as the wildest dream of every cotton producer and bullish speculator came true.\\n Veteran commodity traders knew such crazy price spikes cannot last. Farmers reacted to $2.20 cotton and planted more cotton next season; meanwhile, the demand side of the equation suffered due to high prices, cotton shortage eventually eased. Prices fell like a rock ever since, reaching as low as $0.55 early 2016. \\n\\n Source: tradingcharts.com; cotton monthly continuous chart The legacy of $2.20 cotton While $2.20 may be memories of a distant past for us, its legacy remains. China, seeking cotton supply security to protect itself from future shortages, established a price floor for local farmers on cotton around March 2011 in an effort to boost production when global cotton prices were soaring to the moon. When market price fell below the price floor, the Chinese government would then step in and purchase physical cotton at the set price during harvests, temporarily store it in state reserves, and sell it during time of shortage. The original intention of the policy was to ensure farmer's profitability, thus stability in cotton production and national security for China. Unfortunately, like many good-willed government actions, intervening in the free market always leads to negative unintended consequences. Because the price floor was set too high, local farmers produced much more cotton in the coming season even as global price crashed. Globally, farmers were reacting to high cotton prices and production hit record highs as well. As a result, China cotton ending stocks ballooned to as high as 14.5 MMT by the end of season 2014/2015, more than half the world cotton production at the time (world production: 24.2 MMT). The cost of storing those cotton became very burdensome for the Chinese government, and the Chinese textile industry, suffering from artificially high domestic cotton prices, moved many of their mills overseas in order to survive.\\n Lower Chinese cotton state reserves bode well for prices ahead The Chinese government soon reversed their policy and embarked on a multi-year de-stocking journey. Since 2015, the Chinese government continued selling their state reserves at a steady pace of 10 million bales a year. Understandably, this has depressed prices throughout the years. The USDA estimates that China will have around 30 million bales of cotton at the end of 2018/2019 season, less than half of the 65 million bales during its peak. \\n\\n China Cotton Stock lower in 2018/2019; Source: USDA The reduced cotton stock in China is very positive for prices going forward. For years, high Chinese cotton stock had been acting as an albatross around the neck of cotton price. So, as long as high stocks remain available, cotton prices have no chance at any sort of sustained rally because everyone knew Chinese could have easily dumped a lot of cotton onto the market if there were a shortage and price spike. With the high inventory coming down, a major anchor for the cotton market has finally been removed - the next time we suffer a shortage due to underproduction, prices may easily move higher past $1 mark. USDA estimates global ending stock at 73.19 million bales for the current 2018/2019 season. With a stock to use ratio of 58%, we are currently near the higher end of normal range. However, we need to keep in mind as well that nearly half of these stocks are in the hand of Chinese, and elsewhere in the world, the supply situation is actually tighter (51%) than what we think. I do not like to use ex-China stock figure to paint a bullish picture on any commodity, but we certainly need to take such cases into consideration when performing supply and demand analysis.\\n \\n\\n World Cotton Supply and Use; Source: USDA Not all rainbows and unicorns for cotton This does not mean cotton is going to soar above $1.00 and we should all go long today. After two consecutive deficit seasons, cotton tried to rally late 2017. Prices hit as high as $0.95 and some market participants thought it could even fly past $1.00. Unfortunately, for bulls, cotton stocks are still ample, and the trade war went into full swing this summer, affecting sentiments. Markets pulled back rather quickly as the tariffs hit and optimism faded. On 2nd December, President Trump and President Xi declared a trade truce, and cotton prices, along with most other commodities, rose sharply. The rally couldn't last, however, and prices turned lower in search of a bottom. \\n\\n Trade truce or not, prices continue to decline from the summer high; Source: Investing.com  Cotton bulls should not count on an announcement from the Chinese government to import a large amount of cotton from the United States as well. First of all, the Chinese government is still trying to de-stock and sell off their state reserves in this season. What's the point of buying from the US today and auctioning reserves tomorrow? It's not the Chinese government's job to trade cotton. Even if they do make such an announcement, it's still hard for me to be bullish. China announced multiple soybean purchases after the trade truce, yet soybean prices are trading lower today compared to December 3rd, the day after the trade truce was declared. I feel any sustained price rally will have to come from real consumer demand, and cutting tariffs back to zero will be the best way to stimulate import and real demand in China.\\n Going into next season, expectations are high that the US will produce a large cotton crop. Dr. John Robinson reportedly said that he expects the next cotton crop to be as large as 21 million bales (2018 est: 18.59 million bales). This has likely contributed to the most recent selloff. Currently, I expect prices to consolidate around these levels and reach a range of 70-80 cents. Recent reports regarding poor weather in India capping production is likely to provide support and prevent further price weakness, at least in the short term. USDA will provide the first forecast on next season's crop size in their May WASDE report. If the rest of the world happens to plant more cotton than the previous season as well, then prices could certainly move lower going forward. Bottom line  Cotton to trade range-bound within 70-80 cents. The US is likely to produce a larger crop in the next season. Trade cotton within the range, with a bearish bias. \\nDisclosure: I/we have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

My goal is to always point out quality dividend growth stocks that are trading at fair value or better, and thus likely to deliver not just safe and rising income over time, but market-beating total returns as well. In the past, I’ve highlighted many of Brookfield’s great limited partnerships and REITs including:  Brookfield Infrastructure Partners (BIP) (exclusive article on marketplace) Brookfield Renewable Partners (BEP) Brookfield Property Partners (BPY) and its REIT equivalent (no K1), Brookfield Property REIT (BPR)  What all of these high-yield stocks have in common is being run by Brookfield Asset Management (BAM), the hands-down most experienced and best hard asset (real estate, utilities, infrastructure) manager in the world. I’ve often said that Brookfield is the Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.B) of hard assets, due to its love of value investing, and proven ability to deliver great total returns to investors (its official goal is 12% to 15% long-term total returns for all of its stocks). \\n\\n (Source: Ycharts) Over the past 14 years, the master capital allocators at BAM have managed to exceed those targets by delivering 16.8% CAGR total returns compared to just 8.5% for the S&P 500 (and Berkshire’s 9.4%).\\n Let’s take a closer look at why investors looking to cash in on Brookfield’s expertise, and literally hundreds of trillions of dollars of future growth opportunities (the longest and largest growth runway of any company I’ve ever seen) should consider buying this stock today. That’s especially true now that the current bear market has left the company trading at a 25% discount to fair value and capable of possibly delivering over 20% total returns over the next decade (in line with its 14-year track record).\\n\\nPhoto Source: Forbes May 2017  Brookfield Asset Management: The Berkshire Of Global Hard Assets Has A $100+ Trillion Growth Runway Ahead Of It Brookfield Asset Management has spent 118 years amassing over $330 billion in assets under management. It’s built itself into the world’s largest global hard asset manager, with over 80,000 employees operating out of more than 100 offices in over 30 countries on six continents. \\n\\n (Source: investor presentation) The key to its success is taking a Warren Buffett like approach to deep value investing into quality cash producing assets at opportunistic times (such as during recessions when asset prices are cheap). It then operates those assets, collecting steady and long-term contracted cash flow, improves them, and eventually sells them for large profits, realizing annualized returns on invested capital ranging from 12% to 20% (official goal is 7% to 20% but Brookfield has a great track record of under promising and over delivering).\\n Brookfield’s empire is a complex network of limited partnerships (like BPY, BIP, and BEP), as well as private equity funds. \\n\\n (Source: investor presentation) The LPs raise money from debt markets and retail investors attracted to safe and fast-growing distributions. These LPs pay BAM an asset management fee (usually 1.25% of AUM), an incentive fee (based on market cap growth), and incentive distribution rights capped at 25% of distribution growth above a certain quarterly rate. In addition, BAM directly owns between 30% and 68% of its LP’s common units meaning that it also benefits from the payouts of its LPs which are backed by highly regulated or long-term contracted (and recession resistant) cash flow. \\n\\n (Source: investor presentation) The amount of money retail investors are funneling into LPs like what Brookfield runs has been growing like a weed and is expected to hit $130 trillion by 2030. \\n\\n (Source: investor presentation) The private equity funds raise money from institutions (like pension funds, sovereign wealth funds, and home offices for ultra high net worth individuals) looking to diversify into hard assets. Brookfield’s private equity business raised capital through 13 sources, including leading financial advisors and home offices (who manage money for billionaires).\\n Brookfield has been steadily growing its institutional client base which now numbers 530. Over the next five years, it expects to double that figure, which will mean massive growth in AUM, fees, and funds from operation or FFO. FFO is the company’s equivalent of free cash flow, is what funds the dividend and is what investors in BAM should focus on. Over the past five years, Brookfield’s institutional clients have become ever more enamored with its results. As a result, the average investment per institutional client has risen from $144 million in 2013 to $230 million today. If that trend continues (management expects it will), then doubling BAM’s institutional client base could result in over 100% AUM growth from net inflows alone (never mind asset appreciation and profits). Another reason BAM is seeing so much AUM growth (driving over 20% FFO/share growth per year) is that it continues to diversify into new investment offerings. \\n\\n (Source: investor presentation) While owning and operating hard assets has been its bread and butter since 1902 in recent years the company has moved into becoming a credit provider. For example, it’s recently launched eight infrastructure credit funds which currently have loan books of $6.3 billion. Eventually, BAM expects those eight funds alone to grow their loan books to $160 billion. It could also potentially launch new credit funds targeting commercial real estate. The company is even getting into investment banking (securitizing and listing hard assets on public stock markets). Basically, this shows that BAM is looking to become the global king of hard assets, with its finger in literally every part of infrastructure/real estate/utility pie. Over the past 12 months, Brookfield has raised a total of $20 billion from these combined approaches (LPs and institutional clients) to fund $33 billion in new investments. The $13 billion difference between these figures was asset sales, which were for terms that generated 19% annualized total returns for the company and its investors.\\n \\n\\n (Source: Investor presentation) You’ll note that BAM’s returns on investment have been rising steadily for the past decade. The reason for this is a massive increase in institutional capital looking to invest in hard assets. As more money pours into this asset class, Brookfield is able to find willing buyers to pay rich premiums to what it paid for assets many years ago. But while it’s true that investment returns on any asset class (including stocks) can be volatile, the growing popularity of hard assets is likely a long-term secular trend. \\n\\n (Source: investor presentation) Over the past decade, institutional capital flows into hard assets has doubled the total market and by 2030 the total industry size is expected to hit $100 trillion. Management believes that companies like Brookfield will be able to capture 40% of that total market, meaning that $40 trillion in AUM could be in the hands of publicly traded firms like BAM within 11 years. This means that Brookfield’s already industry-leading scale is a drop in the bucket compared to how big it could potentially grow. For example, despite being the largest and most trust hard asset manager on earth, in 2017 Brookfield’s institutional market share was about 0.5% which shows it has plenty of growth ahead of it. Why is Brookfield so confident that it can grow its market size when there are literally hundreds of global asset managers out there trying to gobble up this massive growth opportunity?\\n Because according to analyst firm McKinsey over the last year 38% of total AUM funneled into hard assets when to the top 20 firms. This is why over the past 12 months BAM’s market share rose from about 0.5% in 2017 to approximately 1.6%, showing the wide moat power of its trusted brand. In total BAM’s total addressable market by 2030 is expected to be $230 trillion, and if it can corner even a small slice of that then it’s AUM (and fees and thus FFO) are going to grow strongly for the next 11 years. But investing in BAM isn’t just about the next decade, it’s about looking out several decades into the greatest secular investing opportunity of the 21st century. According to a recent OECD report, by 2040 the world is going to need to invest nearly $100 trillion into additional infrastructure to support a fast-growing and rapidly urbanizing population. This is why so much institutional money is flowing into this asset class, to fund those necessary and economy growing projects. That investment is going to be across all manner of industries and sectors including:  Renewable energy (a $11 trillion growth opportunity) and smart grids Municipal infrastructure/smart cities telecom/data infrastructure (5G/fiber/telecom towers) Transportation (railroads, toll roads, ports) Energy transportation ($1.2 trillion in new North American midstream infrastructure needed by 2050).  Brookfield’s excellent track record of great returns and trusted brand means that it can quickly raise new institutional capital, including $6.5 billion for its flagship private equity fund in October alone. Rapid asset growth, combined with rising fees from its LP’s (currently growing about 20% annually) has allowed BAM’s revenue and cash flow per share to both grow at 17.2% over the past nine years (about triple that of the S&P 500) and 23% over the past 12 months. And with BAM management owning 20% of its shares, retail investors can be sure that the company’s incentives are deeply aligned with theirs. That management team is composed of 124 head directors, who on average have worked together for 18 years.\\n \\n\\n (Source: investor presentation) Leading this army of industry expert capital allocations is CEO Bruce Flatt, who joined Brookfield 29 years ago and has been in the top job for 15 years. Before running the entire company he ran Brookfield’s real estate division where he proved a master of acquiring quality properties from distressed owners (bankruptcy buys were his specialty). That opportunistic investing model of being the “buyer/investor of last resort” (What Buffett did with big banks in 2008) has become the basis for BAM’s entire global investment strategy and has made countless investors rich over Flatt’s tenure. So just how rich can Brookfield likely make you in the coming years? Realistically the company can likely deliver over 20% long-term total returns to anyone investing today. Dividend Profile: Modest Yield And Growth Rate BUT Excellent Market-Beating Return Potential The most important part of any income investment is the dividend profile which consists of three parts, yield, payout safety, and long-term growth potential. Combined with valuation, this is what drives total returns over time. Now Brookfield’s paltry yield of 1.6% is not anything that will excite most income investors. Nor will the company's dividend growth rate which has averaged 8% over the past two decades. BAM may be a money minting machine, but management is focused on growth of its cash flow not high or fast-growing yield (that’s what its LPs and REIT are for). This is why the company’s FFO payout ratio is a very low 14% because its cash flow has been outpacing cash flow growth for a long time. Currently, analysts expect that to continue through to a smaller extent (consensus dividend growth is 10% vs 11% FFO/share growth).\\n But while even 10% long-term dividend growth is hardly spectacular (many dividend stocks offer the same) as I’ll explain in a moment, Brookfield is still a great investment to consider.  Yield: 1.6% TTM FFO payout ratio: 14% Net Debt/EBITDA: 10.9 (industry average: 2.6) Corporate Leverage Ratio: 2.4 Interest Coverage Ratio: 1.9 Corporate Interest Coverage ratio: 9.0 Debt/Capital: 43% (industry average 54%) Corporate Debt/Capital: 19% S&P Credit Rating: A- Average Corporate Interest Rate: 4.5%  When it comes to dividend safety I consider BAM a true blue-chip 'sleep well at night' or SWAN stock. That’s because the rock bottom payout ratio means that even in a recession (and bear market for asset prices) the dividend isn’t likely to be cut, or even stop growing. The other half of the dividend safety formula is the balance sheet. At first glance, you might think me mad to say that a leverage ratio of 11 or an interest coverage ratio that’s under 2 is “safe”. However, it’s important to realize that due to the way Brookfield operates (its LPs use large amounts of non-recourse self-amortizing asset level debt) the balance sheet is actually far safer than it looks. Due to how international accounting standards work, BAM’s has to consolidate its share of the non-recourse debt of its LPs onto its own balance sheet. This makes it appear as if BAM investors are drowning in debt. In reality, the vast majority of the debt (about 80%) is linked to the assets its LPs have bought/built. Creditors can’t come after either Brookfield’s LP’s entire cash flow, much less that of the parent company. The safe use of non-recourse debt is why Brookfield enjoys an A- credit rating from S&P. The actual corporate leverage ratio is just 2.4, the actual interest coverage ratio is 9 (8 or above is safe for most corporations) and the company’s average interest rate is 4.5%. The bottom line is that BAM’s balance sheet is very strong which is why it has $11 billion in corporate liquidity available to right now and another $11 billion at the LP level to invest in great opportunities.\\n What about dividend growth potential? Well with its very low payout ratio BAM could afford to grow the payout at 15% to 20% for many years. But even if it merely grows at the 10% analysts expect income investors are going to be thrilled for other reasons. \\n\\n (Source: investor presentation) That’s because the fee bearing capital that is the main driver of its FFO is expected to double over the next five years. Brookfield is usually conservative with its growth guidance which is why it typically exceeds its long-term targets by substantial margins. With fee capital expected to grow at 14%, I think analyst estimates of just 11% FFO/share growth are probably overly conservative. \\n\\n (Source: investor presentation) That’s because the company expects 14% growth in fee capital to translate into at least 18% growth in fee earnings (and thus likely FFO/share). This faster rate of growth is why Brookfield is forecasting that BAM investors could enjoy 24% total returns over the next five years. \\n\\n (Source: investor presentation) How realistic is that forecast? Well, I think it might very well be reasonable. That’s because when you combine fast cash flow growth (about 18% annually) along with the current yield and the company’s discount to fair value, that’s roughly what my long-term valuation adjusted total return model says.\\n  Price/FFO: 8.6 20-year average P/FCF: 11.5 Potential Discount to fair value: 25% Potential Upside To Fair Value: 34% 10-Year Valuation Boost (OTCPK:CAGR): 3.0% Potential 10-Year Total Return: (yield + long-term FCF growth + valuation boost): 22.6% Long-Term Total Return (factoring out long-term valuation mean reversion): 19.6%  Today BAM is trading for just 8.6 times FFO, far below its 20 year average of 11.5. That agrees with management own estimate that share are 25% undervalued (based on adjusted net asset value incorporating the carried interest it enjoys as an asset manager). That 25% undervaluation means that investors are likely to experience a 3% annualized total return boost over 10 years as shares revert back to their historical cash multiple. Then add that to the Gordon Dividend Growth Model (Brookfield’s official total return model for all its LPs) of yield + long-term cash flow growth and you get: 1.6% + 18% + 3% = 22.6%. That’s roughly in line with management’s total return forecast and keep in mind that my model assumes it takes 10 years for BAM’s P/FFO to return to its historical norm. If it takes less time then my and management’s return forecasts align even closer. So with the Berkshire of global hard assets trading at a steep discount to fair value, it’s a fantastic buy for all investors, right? Well only if you’re comfortable with its risk profile. Risks To Consider No company is risk-free and there are three things to consider before investing in BAM. First, because it’s a Canadian company (it pays dividends in US dollars) US investors face a 15% withholding tax on their dividends in taxable accounts (but not IRAs or 401Ks). Thanks to the tax treaty we have with Canada the IRS allows Americans to deduct this from their US tax bills, effectively neutralizing the withholding. However, you still have to file the paperwork to get that credit and just $300/$600 per individual/couple in total withholdings (across all foreign companies in all your portfolios) can be claimed with the standard 1040 tax form. For figures above this, the more complex form 1116 is required.\\n As for company risk, the biggest thing to realize about BAM is that this is a highly complex beast. BAM’s involvement in so many different investing areas and products means that there is a chance that management oversteps its expertise and goes outside its circle of competence. Now that’s not to say that BAM is going to blow itself up with its new credit funds, and face an existential threat to its survival ala the Financial Crisis. However, there is a risk that management might end up being forced to take larger losses than are currently baked into its models, which could end up hurting its FFO/share (though probably not enough to threaten the dividend). Finally, I have to point out that BAM is a highly volatile stock. Over the last 10 years, it’s been about 31% more volatile than the S&P 500. However, in the short-term, its volatility can spike, including its 1-year beta soaring to almost three during the Financial Crisis (when anything connected to finance took a swan dive). Another credit meltdown is highly unlikely which means BAM isn’t likely to fall 72% as it did during the Great Recession (market fell 57%). But my point is that BAM’s blue-chip SWAN stock status only pertains to the safety of the dividend and the quality of the company. It does not imply that BAM (or any SWAN stock for that matter) will avoid large paper losses during a market downturn (BAM’s peak decline during this bear market has been 18.1% so far). Bottom Line: You’ve Seen The Rest, Now Invest In The Best While Brookfield Asset Management’s relatively paltry yield and unexciting long-term dividend growth rate might make it appear a lackluster income growth stock, I still consider it a fantastic addition to any dividend growth portfolio. In fact, Dividend Sensei is soon planning on adding the Berkshire of global hard asset management to his new Deep Value Dividend Growth Portfolio. That’s because, while BAM is far from the highest-yielding asset manager you can buy today, it is likely trading at a steep discount to fair value. And under the Buffett mantra that “it’s better to buy a wonderful company at a fair price than a fair company at a wonderful price” I eagerly recommend Brookfield Asset Management anytime it’s trading at fair value or better.\\n That’s because not only is BAM undoubtedly a wonderful company but as the head of the mighty Brookfield global empire, it’s the simplest way for investors to cash in on a decades-long, $100+ trillion growth opportunity in global real estate, infrastructure, and renewable energy. Not just does BAM have the longest and largest growth runway I’ve ever seen for any company, but with its proven master capital allocators finding the best long-term investment opportunities around the globe, this dividend growth stock is a “legend of tomorrow”. One that is likely to deliver high double-digit total returns not just for the next few years, but for many decades to come (and likely over 20% total returns over the next five years). This makes Brookfield as close to a “buy and hold forever” stock as you can find on Wall Street, and a very strong buy during this bear market.

At the point of retiring, this portfolio will transition into a safer distribution yield-based portfolio which is targeted to yield 4% or 5% to cover my daily expenses. Note: This is meant for a 5 to 7-year portfolio, and I hence take a longer-term approach to stock-picking and selection. There is a need for some active management in terms of selection and market timing. I am not assuming I am confident or more intelligent in being able to beat the market, but I am willing to take more risks to generate the returns while I continue to have a stable job supplemented by a high savings rate. With growth in mind, I started my first FIRE Building Portfolio with positions initiated in November. December has been volatile and this impacted my portfolio significantly with Amarin Corp. (AMRN) which I had held for 5 years, and Facebook (FB) incurring losses while short positions in Caterpillar Inc. (CAT) and Tiffany & Co. (TIF) helping to buffer the loss. I continue to keep most of my portfolio in short term peer-to-peer lending as it has given me pretty good returns. (note: some readers have asked what platform I use and also warned me of the risks of P2P lending and I hope to cover this in detail as well) In December, I have been shoring up cash because of the choppy market. I have in total $428,000 in this portfolio and 24% is held in cash, 50% in P2P lending under 12 months, 14% in traded endowments mostly over 5 years to maturity. The remaining 12% is in stocks, and that is mostly concentrated in Amarin Corp. Hence, over the duration of 2019, I am looking to increase my exposure to stocks and to deploy some cash to get more leverage if there is a steep market correction through secured overdraft loans or share financing.\\n Objectives of the Portfolio Please do read this to understand my context of building the screen, but I also welcome feedback and opinions about building this nest egg because at the moment, I have decided, while still young, to incur more risks and to hunt for growth, in what I call a FIRE Building Portfolio. Note: While I am able to continue generating income through employment and am confident I can and want to take on more risks to accelerate the retirement plan. However, others who are more patient and more risk averse should consider this article only as an alternate viewpoint to consider. Do your own homework.

I have recovered my bulk of my investment cost having sold 1,000 shares at $14.88, and some of that cash was withdrawn from the brokerage into my cash position. From the recent trades made, I have not fully allocated my portfolio into shares due to the choppy markets. As a result, I have started to add new positions to protect from the risk of a weak 2019. However, I am still looking to invest into growth and am keen on Qualcomm (QCOM) and Magna International (MGA), both of which I had previously written on but had not initiated positions yet. For my shorts, the general theme is to short consumer discretionary items, and I have done well on Caterpillar (CAT) and Tiffany (TIF) in particular. I continue to see both companies coming off considerably in 2019 and intend to cover them in detail soon on Seeking Alpha. Yoma Strategic (OTCPK:YMAIF) is a position that I took after looking at the real estate market in Myanmar and also because the country does not seem to have gotten its act together. My article on Yoma can be read here. Newly Initiated Positions Long Facebook (FB) via call option was an idea I wrote about on Seeking Alpha recently, and I executed on the trade just before FB tanked from $140 to $120. Thankfully, I have not fully invested and am continually monitoring to enter the market for more. Caveat is there is continued growth overall and a stabilizing USA and European daily active user despite boycotts and account closures. From its 52-week peak at over $220, the stock has declined 45%, while operations have continued to generate cash, and there has been no material drop in daily active users (\"DAU\") or monthly active users (\"MAU\"). In fact, these figures have continued to grow. Analyst estimates an average price target for next year of $189.76. With Dec. 2019 Call Options based on strike price at $160, the cost of $14.50 works out to be a total of $174.50. Potential upside of 109%.\\n Assuming the lower end EPS estimate of $6.03 and 19x PE, the price would trade at about $114. My estimate for the downside is about $132. Hence, the risk in this trade is a total loss on this trade. Stable growth in earnings remains my base case, and I would be long FB at this stage, but since it is cheaper to go long via options, and the volatility of this stock has been pretty large, I figured going into a 1-year call option would be an alternative exposure for me. I previously wrote that I would review this strategy if FB trades near $114, representing a nearly 50% decline from its $220 peak and buy the stock outright if it does trade that low. However, taking a look at the options I have, the price just looks pretty tempting again. \\n\\n Source: my brokerage account The Dec. 2019 call option last traded at $20.25, which works out to be at a total cost of $145. My base case is $132, and if the price goes below my base case, that would be time to pull the trigger on FB. Gold Options I recently bought a Dec. 2019 call option on the XAUUSD to hedge against a possible political and economic conflict between China and the USA or in an event EU does not work out well. This is a small position and does not impact the portfolio by much. Potential Investments - QCOM and MGA I did not set out to short companies over the short term, but I did it as I looked and found some companies to be worthwhile investments which turned out otherwise. I am still looking to go long on companies I find have growth potential over a 7 to 8 year horizon. Hence, I am looking at investing in QCOM and MGA for the following reasons: 1. Qualcomm is high on my shortlist right now. My potential 7% dividend yield play has now shot up further because I wrote at a time when QCOM was $55. It has traded slightly lower at $53.65, and I my base case has not changed. I believe there is an opportunity to pick up QCOM at or near its 52-week low of $48, which brings the yield potential to 8%. Extremely solid!\\n For those who did not have a chance to read the article, my 2019 base case is that QCOM would likely generate adequate free cash flows to cover interest expense of $768 million (based on 2018 figure) and buy back $11 billion worth of shares with debt (roughly $1.5 billion in interest expense in 2019 factored in). This would leave cash available for dividends to be roughly the same or slightly lower than 2018. After all that financial engineering, I reckon by September 2019, QCOM would have a market cap reduced by about 1/3, at $45 billion and a possible ability to maintain dividends of $3.2 to $3.4 billion. The upside is someone purchases QCOM and if there is a favorable settlement with Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL). 2. Magna International is a stock I wrote about that just keeps getting cheaper. Trading at 6.6x PE and a dividend yield of 3%, this automobile component manufacturer has been dragged by the consumer discretionary theme as demand for cars has declined/stagnated. Magna has declined 10% since I wrote about the stock, and nothing material has changed my view. \\n\\n Source: Statista.com Yes, vehicle sales have declined, and the trend is more acute in China. However, MGA has qualities that would allow the company to ride through the storm. While the industry has lagged, Magna picked up +7% sales and +14% EPS growth. The historical dividend record is strong as well, growing at 14% in the past 5 years, and on top of that, Magna is buying back shares. \\n\\n\\n Source: MGA Company filings The NTA (NAV adjusted for intangibles and goodwill of $2.43 billion) is $24.24 billion compared to a $14.7 billion market cap - 0.6x tangible book value. MGA also has cash to repurchase shares, and its cash flow remains strong. Having assumed all else remains similar to 2018, my base case is that MGA grows EPS by 3% just through a $500 million share repurchase. Management shared that they expect $6b of free cash flow between 2018 and 2020, and I reckon the share buyback will continue or increase to about $1 billion annually instead. Given the share price correction, I see this as a stable cash generating business with over 20% upside even as a cyclical stock. However, we might see $30 before we hit a bottom, given that car manufacturers are all suffering. No harm waiting this out to initiate a position closer at those levels. I estimate $30 which is in the region of 5x earnings just because the manufacturers are trading at those valuations or lower. Conclusion Going forward, while I still look to deploy more cash towards investing in stocks, I will be tracking Facebook\\'s active user and overall traffic growth because this is a position I either decide to cut loss or add more depending on whether anything significant occurs. I will also be looking at opportunities to buy into MGA and QCOM. However, there have been some consumer discretionary stocks that I have come across that are quite pricey, and I do keep an open mind towards shorting such stocks. I am also looking to go long in markets like Russia, Hong Kong and Japan through ETFs because I find there is quite good value in those countries.\\nDisclosure: I/we have no positions in any stocks mentioned, but may initiate a long position in QCOM, MGA over the next 72 hours.

      "{'article_name': 'Lids Sale Will Boost EPS, But Genesco Looks Fairly Priced', 'time': None, 'symbol': None, 'class': None, 'company_name': None, 'bus_desc': None, 'summary': 'Genesco finally unloaded Lids for ~$100 million and will use the proceeds to buy back stock.Journeys and J&M are executing well, but Schuh remains a drag on operating income growth.Overall, execution at the company looks strong and buybacks could add $0.40 of EPS.Still, shares look roughly fairly valued at current prices.', 'article': \"Shares of Genesco (GCO) have outperformed several retail competitors over the past month with the stock flat as opposed to down 10%. The company posted solid Q3 earnings and finally sold Lids. I think the Lids sale could ultimately add as much as 40 cents of EPS, and the core business is performing fairly well. That said, shares look fairly priced at current levels. Let's take a look at the implication of the Lids sale, as well as the performance of the rest of the business. Lids Nets $100 Million The Lids sale process took much longer than anticipated, but it has finally culminated in a sale to competitor Fanzz with a minority investment from Fanatics for a total sale price of about $100 million. After taxes and fees, it looks like the sale will net Genesco around $94 million. I think the haul is ultimately somewhat disappointing, but it removes Genesco's comp headwind and allows the company to focus on its core businesses. Genesco will use the proceeds to repurchase stock. At current prices, this would theoretically reduce the share count by 11% and boost earnings per share by about 40 cents. Overall, I think management is making the right choice on both fronts. For one, the Lids business is in decline, and though it can be profitable at a mid-cycle margin, the business is more structurally challenged than it ever has been. Lids got out before it was too late. Secondly, I like the decision to repurchase stock, though I hope management goes about it in a discerning way, attempting to repurchase shares with an eye toward valuation. Given the volatility in retail, I also would not be opposed to keeping some dry powder on the balance sheet in case any other concept starts to struggle.\\n Performance Robust Across the Board Net sales in Q3 were down 1% y/y to $713 million due to a calendar shift. Importantly, comps were up 4% y/y stacking on a 1% gain in Q3'18, resulting in a 5% consolidated two-year stack comp trend. This comp places Genesco in a solid position. Most impressive, in my view, was the strength of the footwear business. Journeys' comp sales were up 9% y/y on top of a 4% gain in the year prior quarter, reflecting the strength of the boot business as well as the segment's ability to identify teen trends. Management noted that the business was positive against strong Q4 comps through November, suggesting the trend will continue for at least another quarter. Journeys' inventory was down 5% y/y, suggesting that Q4 should also be strong from a margin perspective. Johnston & Murphy was the other standout, with comps up 10% y/y on top of a weak 1% decline in Q3'18. J&M has pivoted to more of a lifestyle brand in recent quarters, and I think some of the product is uniquely positioned to capture market share. The company made some investments in marketing through a new catalog and suffered from some wholesale issues, which ultimately resulted in a total revenue growth rate of 7.6% and an operating income margin that declined by 60 basis points y/y. J&M's profitability and revenue growth year-to-date remain healthy, so I am not particularly concerned. Inventory growth lagged sales growth at 7%, and I anticipate increasing merchandise margin going forward. Contrary to J&M and Journeys, Schuh remains challenged. Comps were down 4% y/y, making the two-year stacked trend flat. Total sales were down nearly 6% y/y to $95.6 million, and operating income fell sharply, down 40% y/y to $4.2 million. Operating margin for the segment was down 260 basis points y/y to 4.4% of sales, and the only positive was an 8% decline in inventory. Management's commentary on the business continues to be negative, with heavy discounting weighing on gross margin, and scarcity models pursued by key vendors limiting the access to product that customers actually want. Nevertheless, one of the strengths of the Genesco model is diversification, and the other segments are performing relatively well at the moment, mitigating some of the poor performance.\\n In total, Genesco delivered a flat gross margin at 49.5% of sales, while SG&A deleveraged by just 20 basis points in spite of a tough calendar shift that left total sales growth negative. Excluding $9 million in asset impairments, Genesco would have delivered a 1.4% adjusted operating margin, down just 20 basis points y/y. Inventory is in great shape, down 4.5% y/y, and the company will be sitting on roughly $150 million in cash once the Lids deal closes. Solid Execution But Fairly Valued Overall, I think it is evident that Genesco is executing relatively well, especially in the US. Schuh looks challenged, but much of the weakness can be attributable to factors out of Genesco's control. The business could certainly rebound in the next few quarters, and I would not be surprised. For FY19, Genesco is guiding to positive comps of 2-3% and earnings per share of $3.10-3.40. At current prices, the top-end of the EPS range would be 12.7x earnings, which is not particularly expensive, nor is it cheap relative to many retailers that are now trading at 8-10x earnings. Over the next few quarters, Genesco could buy back as much as $100 million in stock, which would reduce the share count by 11-12% and add around $0.40 per share in earnings. This would reduce the multiple to 11.4x earnings, assuming no growth in operating income. The valuation, in my view, is roughly fair. Shares are not egregiously expensive, but I would not put capital to work in the stock at current prices.\\nDisclosure: I/we have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

XOM is actually down 14% over the past 10 years. In comparison, Chevron (CVX) has done somewhat better than Exxon and is up 43% over the past 10 years. Still, even Chevron pales in comparison with the S&P 500. This is hard for many investors to figure out given the fact that the price of WTI has been more than $80/bbl for much of the past 10 years and as high as $130/bbl: \\n\\nSource: MacroTrends\\n So What Gives? The problem is that shale technology - horizontal drilling and fracking - is readily reproducible. Not only that, but there are multiple expansive shale plays in America: The Marcellus, Utica, Bakken, Eagle Ford, Niobrara, Permian, Haynesville, and the SCOOP/STACK - just to name some of the more notable. Gone are the days when companies like Exxon, Mobil, Chevron, Unocal, and Atlantic Richfield ruled the roost. It used to be that only these big companies that had the technology and the deep pockets to produce large quantities of oil and gas (in places like the Gulf of Mexico and Alaska). Today, there are dozens and dozens of companies that are producing meaningful quantities of shale oil and gas all over the lower 48. Just take a look at the top 10 natural gas producers in August of this year: \\n\\nSource: Natural Gas Supply Association Other than Exxon and BP, many of these top-10 producers were barely known 10 years ago and, even if they were, did not produce anywhere near the gas they are producing today. The same with goes with US oil production. Sure, companies like Chevron, Exxon, ConocoPhillips (COP) and Occidental Petroleum (OXY) are still among the largest producers of oil in the United States. However, look at the list of companies below that were barely on the radar screen 10 years ago and that are producing significant quantities of shale oil (and gas) production:   Company Q3 Oil & Gas Production   EOG Resources (EOG) 749,000 boe/d   Anadarko Petroleum (APC) 682,000 boe/d   Pioneer Resources (PXD) 321,000 boe/d   Devon (DVN) 522,000 boe/d   Marathon Oil (MRO) 419,000 boe/d   Diamondback Energy (FANG) 220,000 boe/d *   TOTAL 2.9 million boe/d   Source: Q3 EPS Reports; * Adjusted for FANG Takeover of Energen\\n As of Q3, the six companies shown above - most of whom were very small players 10 years ago - now produce the roughly the equivalent of another Chevron - 2.9 million boe/d. And note that this list is by no means complete ... there are dozens of other companies out there producing close to, or more than, 100,000 boe/d today. The point is, lower 48 shale oil production is booming today and has been growing steadily since horizontal drilling and fracking technology first burst onto the scene: \\n\\nSource: EIA In the most recent weekly report, US production was 11.6 million bpd - more than double of the production of 2009. The chart for natural gas production doesn\\'t look a lot different. Meantime, the technology keeps improving: Multi-pad drilling and better completion techniques and recipes continue to reduce costs and increase productivity. Many producers\\' biggest growth constraint is adequate pipeline takeaway capacity! Thank God for that. Bottom Line The bottom line here is that the energy sector in the U.S. is now a no-moat investment proposition. That is, the barriers to compete is very low. It\\'s not even a moat - it\\'s a puddle that can be stepped over. The technology is readily available, the majors cannot possibly buy up all the land, and money is still relatively easy to raise. What this all means, of course, is lower prices. Note that the days of $10-plus Henry Hub gas appears to be over, at least for the foreseeable future. In fact, Henry Hub hasn\\'t even been above $6 since 2009: \\n\\nSource: MacroTrends\\n Also note the Wall Street Journal reports that as producers concentrate on oil production, associated natural gas production is so high it is overwhelming pipeline infrastructure and is sometimes given away for free in places like the Permian Basin. Meanwhile, up north in Canada, the energy patch is a complete disaster. Over production of both oil sands crude and natural gas have overwhelmed the pipeline infrastructure and just cratered prices. Recently, oil sands CEOs called in the government to help sort out the WCS price mess by mandating production cuts. We\\'ll see how that works and how rail transport affects pricing for oil sands crude. Meantime, the natural gas price in Western Canada is still suffering. And don\\'t tell me OPEC no longer has power. OPEC plus Russia can directly determine the cash flow generation of US shale producers. Granted, it\\'s in OPEC\\'s and Russia\\'s interest to have high oil prices. But they too are producers scrapping for market share. Their production decisions matter here in the U.S. Just recently, note the role OPEC politics plays as on the price of oil: Trump announced the US would put sanctions on Iranian oil exports and pleaded with Saudi Arabia to raise production to mitigate the price impact. Then, the Trump administration reversed itself and announced waivers for Iran\\'s top eight customers. That\\'s the primary factor that Brent and WTI are currently trading at $52.50 and $45/bbl, respectively: Over production. The other factor, or course, is a concern of reduced global oil demand because of the current U.S./China trade war and what it could do to the global economy going forward. Bottom line: In the shale oil environment, we can depend on one thing: Volatility. Oil prices will be volatile as US energy producers elbow their way into a global market in which the U.S. used to be a net importer of petroleum products. The U.S. is now a net exporter. This has changed everything for global energy markets. Obviously an energy company needs smart and informed management that\\'s quick on its feet and can allocate capital appropriately.\\n What Should Energy Investors Do? In my opinion, energy investors need to be more selective than ever before. For a real world case, note that Exxon\\'s stock price is today below where it was 10 years ago: \\n\\nSource: Yahoo Finance And before Exxon shareholders point out the recent sell-off, note that Exxon was below where it was 10 years ago even before the sell-off. My point here is not to bash Exxon, but for investors to realize that even buying the biggest producers with the best balance sheet does not guarantee success. What energy investors need to be looking for is the following:  Excellent source rock (i.e. a low-cost, low breakeven, resource base). Strong balance sheet - investment grade preferred. Smart and flexible shareholder oriented management. \"Special\" assets.  If you don\\'t have all of these, you will likely not succeed in the volatile and generally \"lower-for-longer\" oil and gas price environment I see lasting for many years to come. What Exxon primarily lacks is No. 3 - a flexible and shareholder-friendly management team. Management appears to be focused on growing Exxon just for the sake of getting bigger, regardless of whether or not shareholders will get a decent total return (stock price appreciation plus dividend yield) because of it. While Exxon does pay a decent dividend, that\\'s pretty much all investors have to show over the past decade. Recently, the new Exxon CEO appears to be continuing on much as before. I say this because year-over-year capital spending at Exxon will take a another significant jump next year as we head into another low-price environment: \\n\\nSource: 2018 Investor Update\\n Note the majority of increase is in Exxon\\'s upstream segment (i.e. just more production...). I certainly agree with Exxon\\'s continued and even accelerated investments to bring the massive 5 billion bbl (and growing) Guyana resource to market. But I have issues with some of the other growth initiatives. In my mind, Exxon should have allocated more capital back to shareholders and reward them for the past decade that resulted in a relative flat total return. Apparently Exxon is forging into a very different future with the very same \"strategy\" it has had over the past decade. I doubt the outcome will be much different. (Note: I plan to next write a Seeking Alpha article on Exxon to specifically address this issue - please keep an eye out for it). Contrast Exxon with a company like ConocoPhillips (COP), whose management \"gets it.\" Back in 2016 I wrote an article (see COP Unveils A Flexible, Analytics-Driven, Scenario-Based Cash Allocation Strategy) showing what management\\'s strategy was with respect to the new \"shale era.\" Basically it\\'s a flexible allocation model that puts a priority on free cash flow and total shareholder returns over various oil & gas price cycles. As a result, COP management said earlier this year (when the oil price was much higher) that they would not \"chase the price of oil.\" Good call given what has unfolded. With this strategy in place, COP\\'s 2019 capital budget if flat year-over-year. However, due to the company\\'s other strategy (asset sales, debt reduction, a general portfolio \"high grading\") the same capital budget as last year is expected to grow production 8% on a per debt-adjusted share basis. This, in addition to the company being FCF positive at $40/bbl, is what investors want to see in an energy company. But it all starts with COP\\'s management team being focused on total returns to shareholders. And this is not new at COP. Remember, COP spun off the downstream business into Phillips 66 (PSX) back in 2012. Phillips 66 then formed an MLP, Phillips 66 Partners (PSXP), to monetize midstream assets. As a result, over the past decade COP has run rings about its bigger peers Exxon and Chevron in terms of total returns. Not even close. Because it all starts with management being focused on total returns to shareholders - not simply growing production or revenue. It\\'s all about generating and growing free cash flow and allocating that to shareholders (not just the executive management team...).\\n A focus on shareholder returns led COP to sell the majority of its high-cost oil sands production and the majority of its lower 48 dry gas production. Before those asset sales, COP\\'s full-year 2016 production was 1.567 million boe/d. The most recent quarter\\'s production was 1.224 million boe/d, or a decline of ~350,000 boe/d over the past couple of years. Yet during that same time period, the stock went from the low $40s to nearly $80 before the recent sell-off began. Why? Because the company high graded its production profile, paid down debt to an investment grade level, and focused on generating free cash flow. As a result, COP generated $1.9 billion of free cash flow in Q3 and is now breakeven at $40/bbl WTI. This is a lesson that many energy companies need to learn, but that most have not. COP \"gets it\" and as a result they \"shrank-to-grow.\" While production may have dropped significantly, shareholder returns went up significantly. And that\\'s what matter: How free cash flow generation is allocated so that shareholders get a decent return. This is a lesson Exxon badly needs to take note of. Lastly, investors need to take a look at executive pay packages. Many companies reward CEO\\'s for simply growing production instead of what they should be rewarded for: An appreciating stock price and/or increasing per share free cash flow generation. So you want to stick with companies that have a pretty clear line of sight to free cash flow generation with \"special assets.\" COP has at least two: Alaska and the Eagle Ford. Both have long runways for growth and generate excellent returns. In Alaska, COP has made some solid recent discoveries and may have \"cracked the code\" with their seismic technology. Conoco has yet to explore the majority of their Alaska leasehold. \\n\\nBetter still - ConocoPhillips owns 29.2% of the Trans-Alaska Pipeline (\"TAPS\") that transports its northern Alaskan production to market. That means the company is making money coming and going. And the majority of Alaskan crude is sold at Brent-based pricing.\\n Summary and Conclusion Investors need to view the U.S. energy production sector as one that offers a relatively \"no moat\" proposition. Long gone are the days when a handful of companies controlled production of oil and gas with strong pricing. There are literally dozens and dozens of companies that are able to grow oil and gas production - some quite dramatically - in today\\'s \"shale era\". And all this production has led to low oil and gas pricing power. As a result, investors need to look for the following:  Excellent source rock (i.e. a low-cost, low breakeven, resource base). Strong balance sheet - investment grade preferred. Smart and flexible shareholder oriented management. \"Special\" assets.  If a company doesn\\'t have all of these, you may be wasting your time. I would especially avoid those highly-levered companies that don\\'t even have a \"special asset\" they can depend on to pull them through a low-price scenario that last six months (or more). I think ConocoPhillips is one company that checks all the boxes and whose management has proven it has the right strategy in place to deal with the volatile price environment prevalent in the era of shale oil and gas. Note that COP is one of the few energy companies that is still up year-to-date after the recent sell off: \\n\\nSource: Yahoo Finance\\nDisclosure: I am/we are long COP, CVX, XOM, PSX, PSXP.

While a near-term bounce is likely, it may not hold if history is a guide.” (Charlie Bilello) Italy “Debt ‘must be kept under surveillance, but it isn't so scary,’ Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte said at his year-end press conference in Rome. ‘Italy's economic fundamentals are very solid.’ He also reaffirmed confidence in his coalition's controversial economic policies following a weeks-long standoff with the EU, as the government races against the clock to pass its 2019 budget law before Dec. 31.” (Wall Street Breakfast) Thought For The Day Long before the term “fake news” had been coined, I used to challenge my son when he was a little kid (he’s now 20) reading my Wall Street Journal with a popsicle slung in his mouth to choose the most obviously distorted news report of the day. Journalistic conventions of reporting are just that – conventions, but they’re not always the same thing as the truth, and sometimes they are its opposite. Or sometimes it’s not the journalists but those they are quoting who are untruthful. In any event, I wanted him to learn to think critically about what he read.\\n So as I read the item on Wall Street Breakfast (quoted above), the story about Italy’s prime minister defending his country’s economy was today’s easy pickings. Italy’s economic fundamentals are actually quite problematic, which is actually why its people elected a new government seeking to make significant economic reforms. But that government hasn’t logged even a year of governance yet, and so Italy remains, as it has now been for a long time, the European country with the highest debt besides Greece. Investors may recall that Greece’s problems nearly toppled the EU a few years ago. If Italy’s problems continue to mount, its size and importance will topple Europe. Italy’s new government has been at loggerheads with the EU over its budget deficit and debt levels. I actually sympathize more with Italy, because the EU’s conservative approach to finance – in a word, austerity – seeks to contain rather than end the problem, whereas Italy’s leaders (some at least) are looking to reform the economy in order to trigger growth again. Frankly, that’s the only way to do it. No one should expect the economic situation to improve without a return to capitalism. The U.S. economy got a huge economic boost from the 2017 tax cuts, and putting more money in Italians’ pockets could similarly help. Spending restraint is also needed (in the U.S. as well). Neither of those elements are yet in place. Until they are, Italy’s economic fundamentals are rather sickly. You needn’t look at all the usual tables and charts. The quickest, meaningful snapshot can be seen in the World Bank’s Ease Of Doing Business rankings, on which Italy comes in at 51 overall, including a ranking of 112 for getting credit and 111 for enforcing contracts. Ultimately, if people can’t access capital and feel secure about their business dealings, jobs will not be created and the economy will not grow. The U.S., incidentally, ranks No. 9 on that list. Every self-respecting, upwardly mobile nation should aspire to be on its Top 5.\\n Italy is a large and important nation, with every reason to prosper, if only its government will remove the many obstacles. Prime Minister Conte may turn out to be the one who does this, but until he’s chalked up some real accomplishments, his blustery words will be void of meaning. -- Please share your thoughts in our comments section.

There are several benefits for airlines in utilising operating leases compared with owning the aircrafts outright. The key advantage is that an airline does not need to recognise the asset (aircraft) and associated liability (e.g. finance lease) on its balance sheet. Secondly, there may be tax advantages in the form of tax deductions for operating lease payments (compared with depreciation and interest costs otherwise claimed), and generally, these cross-border leases are also not subject to withholding taxes either. The effective tax rate for the lessors is also quite low (~10-15%), so the economics on a post-tax basis are quite efficient. Finally, the airline does not carry the residual value risk of the aircraft (the residual price of aircrafts can fluctuate widely depending on market conditions and specific aircraft model). AER is by far the largest independent player in the industry and thus benefits from scale:  Volume discounts on new aircrafts and access to best-in-class market intelligence. Deep bench and experienced aviation experts team. Lower cost of funds (the only leasing company whose unsecured bonds have been rated investment-grade) and broad relationships with many banks and broader investment community. Access to effectively all airlines and agility in the placement and re-marketing of aircrafts (new orders as well as old aircrafts). As a case in point, currently, over 90% of aircraft deliveries through 2020 have been leased already as highlighted in the company\\'s Q3 2018 earnings deck. \\n So what are the risks in the business model? The aviation industry is extremely cyclical and capital intensive. On the asset side, AER is predominantly exposed to credit risk on airlines\\' clients as well as \"metal risk\" (i.e. residual value or market value of aircrafts). The latter may manifest as an asset impairment that can be assessed at any time during the lease period or residual value risks (carrying value in its books is less than market value). In recent years, AER has been recording net gains on asset sales - but I wouldn\\'t necessarily count on this continuing in a more adverse environment. The credit and metal risks are highly correlated - if and when the aviation industry goes south for any reason (e.g. recession, high oil price), demand for aircrafts will hit bottom at roughly the same time as weaker airlines are more likely to default on their lease obligations. When an airline defaults on its lease commitments, AerCap will typically repossess the aircraft and look to redeploy to alternative airlines under a new lease or sell the aircraft. To protect itself, AerCap collects upfront (especially from weaker credit clients) a maintenance reserve which is essentially a guarantee payment over and above the lease payments commitments. To date, AerCap has managed defaults extremely well with approximately 1% run rate for impairments over the last decade. However, make no mistake about this - if and when the aviation industry will face real and sustained turbulence, the losses will likely be much more meaningful and material. It is worth noting that there are also specific aircraft model type risks (portfolio risk) - the market value of some models (e.g. old technology and/or less fuel efficient) can materially reduce as they fall out of favour and thus forcing owners/lessors (e.g. AerCap) to take an impairment charge or loss on disposal. Portfolio management (i.e. aircraft model mix) is a key part of proactive risk management in the aviation leasing industry. Did I mention the capital-intensive nature of the industry?\\n AerCap needs to fund upfront the purchase of aircrafts. Its forward order book to 2022 includes ~400 aircrafts. These are hard commitments and failure to complete deliveries may result in substantial costs. The annual Capex commitments are in the region of ~USD5-6b. In addition to that, there are scheduled debt maturities as well (~USD4b for the next 12 months) - so in total, AerCap needs to fund ~USD10b Capex (including debt maturities) every year (which is done mostly through debt finance). Clearly, continued access to debt finance, in its many forms, is a key risk facing the firm. Having said that, the firm\\'s approach to liability management is conservative given its large liquidity buffer. Based on current liquidity reserves and available bank facilities, it can operate for well over 12 months without the need to access additional financing. In the event of a deep and prolonged downturn in the industry, that liquidity buffer provides the firm with ample time to further calibrate its asset and liability structure to meet the new environment (e.g. sell aircrafts, joint ventures, securitisation etc.). The current liquidity position is reproduced below (Source: Company Q32018 Earnings Deck): \\n\\n Final Thoughts To reiterate, the aviation industry is cyclical and capital intensive. There are substantial risks especially if a downturn is on the horizon. Whilst I have been watching the aviation leasing industry for many years - until now, I largely remained on the sidelines. Given current valuation of AerCap, I now find the investment case compelling. I believe its diverse client base, scale, depth of expertise, and (relative to peers) conservative balance sheet and strong liquidity position will enable it to ride out a severe downturn. Being the stronger of the bunch, it should also benefit from any consolidation opportunities.\\n It is already trading at distressed levels (unjustifiably so). Note management has been buying back shares where the stock was trading in the 50s. My target price is $52 and will consider buying aggressively if share price drops further.\\nDisclosure: I/we have no positions in any stocks mentioned, but may initiate a long position in AER over the next 72 hours.

Based on the available information, our preliminary conclusion is that Green Growth\\'s bid is highly misleading and opportunistic in nature. The bid is very unlikely to succeed and we think Green Growth is simply trying to copy the playbook used by Aurora (OTC:ACB) when it acquired CanniMed in a hostile-turned-friendly deal. Management and owners of Green Growth most likely know that its bid is unlikely to succeed but are trying to use this bid to increase its profile and hopefully obtain a higher valuation for its already overvalued stock. We do not like this deal and do not believe the bid will succeed. However, we think the bid will temporarily create volatility for both stocks and Green Growth might benefit from more attention, similar to the miraculous uprise of Aurora (OTC:ACB) after its CanniMed bid. However, we would not recommend Green Growth shares due to its extremely overvalued stock and barbarian approach to M&A. \\n\\n\\n The Made-Up C$7.0 Share Price After the market closed, Green Growth (formal name is Xanthic Biopharma) announced its hostile bid for Aphria with the following details:  All-stock hostile deal  Each Aphria share will receive 1.5714 shares of Green Growth Based on Green Growth\\'s Thursday closing share price of C$4.98 on the CSE, the offer represents a value of C$7.83 which implies only a 3.4% premium over Aphria\\'s closing share price of C$7.57! Green Growth used a made-up value of C$7.0 for its shares and calculated a 45.5% premium based on this entirely fictitious share price  The press release is highly misleading because the C$7.0 quoted by Green Growth for its own shares is entirely based on internal conjecture: Green Growth expects to complete a concurrent brokered financing of C$300 million, at a price per share of C$7.00, to both illustrate confidence in the value of the consideration under the Offer and to fund the business growth of the combined entity. Green Growth expects that certain of its existing shareholders will commit to backstop the C$300 million financing concurrently with the execution of a business combination agreement with Aphria... Basically, Green Growth is saying that its shareholders believe that its stock should be worth C$7.0 per share despite the market only given it a valuation of C$4.98 per share now (and that\\'s after a mysterious ~50% run in the last two weeks). The C$300 million financing referenced in the press release is not completed and \"certain existing shareholders\" have not committed to such a transaction. There is no evidence to suggest that investors are actually willing to acquire C$300 million shares at C$7.0 per share. In any case, the financing is highly irrelevant to the hostile bid as the consideration being offered is 100% stock and none of the C$300 million will be paid to Aphria shareholders. The biggest fallacy in Green Growth\\'s bid is that it ignored the market prices of its stock and the fact that its stock had a ~50% sudden run-up in the past month. To claim that Green Growth\\'s own shareholders believe its shares are worth C$7.0 is beyond unreasonable and almost amusing.\\n \\n\\n (Source: TSX / Green Growth Share Price) The Bid Likely Implies Negative Premium When we look deeper, it seems like Green Growth\\'s bid actually carries a significant negative premium for Aphria shareholders. Given that Green Growth\\'s stock rallied ~50% in two weeks, we think it is prudent and absolutely appropriate to use volume weighted average price (\"VWAP\") in this case. Based on the table below, we can see that Green Growth\\'s bid only represented a 3% premium based on its spot price. Furthermore, the offer would actually imply a discount (the opposite of premium) of 20% and 26% to Aphria\\'s closing price using the 10-day and 20-day VWAP of Green Growth. \\n\\n More importantly, investors need to know that Green Growth\\'s stock had a huge rally in the last two weeks, rising ~50% from C$3.36 on December 14, to C$4.98 on December 27. We tried looking for explanations of the huge rally but came away believing that the recent rally was unfounded:  Dec 6: Announced that it was awarded 7 retail licenses in Nevada  Dec 11: Acquired Just Healthy which holds a medical cannabis license in Massachusetts for US$3.75 million Dec 13: Acquired second cultivation site in Nevada for US$13 million Dec 14: Acquired a dispensary in Nevada for US$15 million  With 197 million basic shares outstanding, Green Growth\\'s market capitalization increased from C$662 million on December 14 to C$981 million on December 27. With less than US$10 million revenue in 2018, the stock is easily the most overvalued U.S. cannabis stock in our entire coverage universe. On the operational side, Green Growth currently only has a single dispensary in Las Vegas and a cultivation facility in Nevada. Even after including the acquisitions discussed above, we think Green Growth remains a small single state operator with an extremely overvalued stock.\\n Conclusion Green Growth began trading on the CSE on November 13 and ended the day at C$3.05 that day. Without obvious catalysts, the stock miraculously rose ~50% to close at C$4.98 on Thursday before it announced its hostile takeover bid for Aphria. We believe that the bid has a near zero chance of success and Green Growth is likely just trying to grab investor attention and inflate share price. Green Growth is a single state operator with a single store operating in Nevada currently. Its stock is extremely overvalued and, in fact, it is the most expensive U.S. cannabis stock among our coverage universe.  Green Growth\\'s offer announcement came across as highly misleading by quoting the offer price and premiums based on a made-up internal valuation of C$7.0 when its shares actually closed at C$3.98 the same day. Using the market price, the offer only represents a value of C$7.83 and a mere 3% premium over Aphria\\'s closing price. Using 10-day and 20-day VWAP, the offer implies a negative premium of 20% and 26% discount to Aphria\\'s closing price. Ultimately, we think the bid is going to fail and fade away but Green Growth might benefit from its publicity stunt and the Aphria saga continues.\\nDisclosure: I/we have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

That deal, which closed in the final days of October, has been very painful as I am sure that investors would be willing to spent over a billion to get out of the deal, as Pinnacle has seen soft results as of recent, just at a time when the market is shying away from debt-loaded companies. The only good news are lower expectations and confirmation that synergies will be realised, but that is not good enough for me at the moment in order to become enthusiastic about the shares. About The Deal After a long time of consistent rumours, ConAgra and Pinnacle decided to combine their operations this summer in quite a larger deal which would add little over $3.1 billion in annual revenues to ConAgra. Investors were long upbeat on the combination of the two companies as food companies benefit from economies of scale, certainly in an environment in which growth is not, or hard to find. The implied $68 offer eventually made for Pinnacle valued the company at 15.8 times current EBITDA, as that multiple was set to decline to 12.1 times if synergies are accounted for. By adding frozen and shelf-stable brands like Birds Eye, EVOL, Hawaiian Kettle Style Potato Chips and some others, ConAgra would grow to become a $11 billion giant in terms of sales. With these snacks and sweets, and great brands in frozen foods, the promise is to deliver on greater growth as the company furthermore projected $215 million in cost synergies by 2022. The problem with the deal is that it would jack up leverage ratios to 5.0 times upon closing as the company outlined plans to maintain its $0.85 per share annual dividend payout, creating relatively few levers to maintain leverage ratios.\\n What Went Wrong? Alongside the deal announcement in June of this year, ConAgra reported its results for the fiscal year of 2018. The company reported a 0.2% decline in organic sales for the year but ended the final quarter with 2.0% growth. While (organic) revenue trends have been dismal, note that earnings were quite strong with adjusted earnings up 21.3% to $2.11 per share. For the standalone business, the company outlined a guidance calling for organic sales growth between 1% and 2% and adjusted operating margins seen between 15.0% and 15.3% of sales. Ever since, the company announced just a small divestment in July in Canada, followed by the first quarterly earnings reported in September, as the company reiterated the full year guidance. In October, the company announced a $575 million equity issuance in order to limit the build-up in leverage following the Pinnacle deal. Shares had fallen to $35 and change at the time, something not too worrying still. The real issue was the second quarter earnings report. Second quarter organic sales growth was down 1.6% as the company estimates that hurricanes shaved off an estimated 220 basis points from reported growth. Total revenues did rise by 13.2%, driven by the closure of the Pinnacle deal during the quarter. While management claims that the core own business was having a solid quarter, management has identified \"challenges\" for Pinnacle which it believes are transitory instead of structural. That is an issue with leverage up so much in connection to the deal. Total debt stood at $11.6 billion at the end of the quarter, for a net debt position of roughly $11.2 billion. With pro-forma sales around $11 billion and adjusted operating margins seen around 15%, that yields adjusted EBIT of $1.65 billion. D&A charges of ConAgra run at just around $250-300 million, for essentially 3-4% of sales. Working with a similar ratio, I end up with D&A charges per annum at perhaps $400-450 million, for EBITDA of $2.0-2.1 billion ahead of synergies. This shows the real struggle with leverage up to as much as 5.6 times based on an EBITDA number of $2.0 billion.\\n What Now? Shares of ConAgra have fallen from $40 this summer, and $30 at the start of December, to just $21 by now following softer results, turmoil in the markets and caution towards highly leveraged players. With a diluted share count of 422 million shares, some $8.5 billion in value has gone up into smoke since the summer and half of that this past month alone. The only bright news in the recent earnings report was the expectation that synergy targets would be exceeded, but that is simply very necessary to maintain leverage with sales under pressure. The problem furthermore seems to be largely within Pinnacle as it is expected to generate just $3.01 billion in sales this year, vs. a $3.17 billion internal target, with adjusted operating margins falling 150 basis points following the softer top-line sales results. ConAgra attributes this to less than flawless execution and weak innovation, as this has been very painful for investors. After all, both parties held deal discussions for a while, as due diligence obviously came short with the deal only having closed just a few months ago. While management remains committed to the long-term earnings and leverage targets, it is very clear that investors have concerns, as the headwinds force the company to halt buybacks, just when the shares are \"cheap\". Reality is that market value of the shares has fallen to less than $9 billion, which combined with the current net debt load translates into an enterprise valuation of just $20 billion, at roughly 1.8 times sales. To put this into perspective, the company paid a sale multiple more than double this ratio when it acquired Pinnacle. Financials In my eyes, the math is pretty easy. A 15% clean operating margin number looks attainable, although margins see pressure. In a good case, in which sales recover and synergies boost operating margins, I am willing to work with 20% margins. That leaves $1.65 billion in EBIT in the base case (15% margins on $11 billion in pro-forma sales), and $2.20 billion in EBIT in the good case (20% margins on $12 billion in pro-forma sales). Currently, net debt amounts to $11.2 billion, as a 4-5% effective cost of debt works down to $500 million. I furthermore assume 25% effective tax rates.\\n Based on the current net debt load, that implies earnings anywhere between $862 million and $1.42 billion, for earnings between $2.00 and roughly $3.30 per share. A market multiple in both cases would work down to a valuation of roughly $35-60, although the latter requires years of real integration and execution. That was the promise of the stock when it traded at these higher multiples yet investors now seem happy if the lower end of the earnings targets can be achieved in the coming years. For now, high leverage and concerns about financing/refinancing are rightfully weighing on the shares. Reality is that expectations are quite low now and that the company has some levers to pull, including synergies, deleveraging and potential divestments. Shares look cheap at 10 times \"adjusted\" earnings, yet the market is full of bargains at this point in time as leverage is quite high, with other names with less execution risk and lower leverage multiples being on sale for similar earnings multiples.\\nPlease subscribe to Value In Corporate Events - Marketplace Checkout to obtain premium research on all the latest IPOs, M&A activity and other corporate events.

      "{'article_name': \"Cumberland Pharmaceuticals: One Step Forward Isn't Enough\", 'time': None, 'symbol': None, 'class': None, 'company_name': None, 'bus_desc': None, 'summary': \"CPIX finally put some of its cash to work, acquiring VIBATIV from Theravance Biopharma.But the acquisition seems risky, given Theravance's commentary regarding the drug, and the rest of the portfolio continues to decline.Long-running problems haven't been resolved, and recent pops in CPIX stock seem unjustified.Structurally, this is an odd stock to short - but there is a potential case, and at best CPIX looks like a clear 'avoid'.\", 'article': 'For years, the problem with small-cap specialty pharmaceutical company Cumberland Pharmaceuticals (CPIX) has been a lack of progress. The company raised $75 million in a 2009 IPO in part to fund acquisitions of drugs that might be \"languishing\" at larger companies. As of the end of Q3 2018, the company still had $50 million of that cash remaining - and hadn\\'t made a major acquisition in the nine-plus years on the public markets. Meanwhile, the company continued to talk up the potential of its ifetroban compound, which underpinned four different product candidates. A Phase II dose escalation clinical study for Hepatoren, the first ifetroban product, began in 2011. Little progress has been made: enrollment for further studies even recently has taken longer than expected. Acetadote, used to treat acetaminophen overdoses, lost patent protection, and revenue has collapsed as a result. Smaller additions to the portfolio have faded. Cumberland, meanwhile, continues to focus on profitability - an odd choice in the drug space, but an all-too-common strategy in the small-cap category. For smaller companies, plans to combine growth and profitability quite often wind up with neither. From a broad standpoint, the strategy here long has seemed questionable, as I wrote almost three years ago. Cumberland\\'s avowed strategy was to buy drugs lost in the proverbial shuffle at larger companies - but wasn\\'t clear that such drugs even existed, particularly since Cumberland hadn\\'t found any. The supposed potential of existing drugs and the pipeline was undercut by a refusal to spend up on R&D or sales behind it. Cumberland simply looked like an unprofitable, zero-growth small-cap - and a trading stock at best.\\n That story does seem like it might have changed, as Cumberland has closed on the acquisition of anti-infective VIBATIV from Theravance Biopharma (TBPH). Cumberland is spending $25 million (including a $5 million payment next year) for the product - about half of its cash balance. VIBATIV will become Cumberland\\'s biggest drug, and along with other efforts, could spark growth heading into 2019. So far, investors seem to like the deal. CPIX stock gained 16% on the news. Despite a rough broad market, shares have rallied from a brief 18-month low reached in late October.  I\\'m far less optimistic toward the acquisition, however - and the reaction to the purchase seems to have obscured real concerns about the rest of the business. It\\'s tough to put together a short case for CPIX, given the lack of leverage on the balance sheet and problems with a near-term catalyst. But this long has been a stock that looked dangerous; it looks even moreso at the moment. VIBATIV The Theravance deal seems exactly like what Cumberland has been looking for since 2009. VIBATIV is Theravance\\'s only commercialized product, but the case for TBPH rests much more on COPD treatment Revefenacin, which should be launching soon, and other compounds in its pipeline. Theravance, with a $1 billion-plus market cap, simply had better uses of its resources and focus.  Meanwhile, Cumberland can sell the product - used for hospital- and ventilator-acquired bacterial pneumonia (HABP/VABP) and other skin conditions - largely through its existing acute sales force. There will be some additional spend required, per the Q3 conference call, but for the most part Cumberland is leveraging existing assets. According to Theravance filings, VIBATIV trailing twelve-month sales are right about $18 million - which would easily make it the highest-selling drug in the Cumberland portfolio. And sales have risen 21% YTD, per the TBPH 10-Q, which would make it the fastest-growing Cumberland drug as well. Patents run through \"at least 2027\", according to Theravance filings.\\n All told, optimism toward the deal seems to make some sense. But there\\'s another, much more pessimistic, way to view the acquisition. VIBATIV has been a bit of disappointment for Theravance. Theravance cut spending behind the drug in 2017, with the 10-K specifically citing competition from generics. Sales dropped 16% last year, which the K attributed to the launch of generic daptomycin (the branded version is Merck\\'s (MRK) Cubicin). The company wrote, \"To date, VIBATIV has not been broadly accepted by physicians, patients, third-party payors, or the medical community in general,\" again due to generics (both daptomycin and vancomycin) along with branded products from Merck\\'s Sivextro, Teflaro and Dalvance from Allergan (AGN), and others. That competition seems a significant problem in the U.S. market. International growth faces challenges as well. Cumberland has never proven all that successful in selling its products overseas: international revenue was just $1.6 million in 2017, according to its 10-K, less than 4% of total sales after a 20% y/y decline. Clinigen Group (OTC:CGNGY) in 2016 returned the EU rights to Theravance, who decided not to move forward in that market on its own. Partners did sell VIBATIV in other markets (including Canada, Russia, Israel, China, and India) but total Theravance revenue outside the US was a little over $1 million (all in Europe). Theravance is making the deal to focus on bigger, better opportunities. But it\\'s also making the deal to get out from under a drug whose sales appear to have disappointed. Thervance ramped its sales force behind the drug in 2015, only to have competition lead revenues to decline almost immediately out of the gate. And a \"black box\" warning for treatment of HABP/VABP \"add[s] complexity to the marketing of VIBATIV\", as Theravance put it in the K. The 21% growth this year does help the case a bit. But Theravance probably didn\\'t put too much muscle behind sales and marketing of the drug over the last few months of ownership, and it will take Cumberland some time to ramp up its own efforts. Any disruption in the hand-off, augmented by competitive pressures, could lead sales to again decline.\\n At the least, there\\'s real risk here. And while Cumberland has a nice base to go with VIBATIV, it\\'s tough to have confidence in Cumberland\\'s biggest swing yet given real concerns about the performance of its more recent, smaller deals. The Three Big Drugs I\\'m a bit surprised by the 16% gains following the VIBATIV announcement - though I do see why investors might see the acquisition as value-added, or at least have some optimism toward the fact that the company finally is putting cash to work. The 12% jump following Q3 earnings the following week, however, is much more difficult to explain. It\\'s possible reports of an earnings beat drove the optimism, though the \\'beat\\' seems due more to a soft single-analyst estimate. Even adjusted earnings reversed to a loss from a modest profit the year before; more troubling, revenue declined 24% year-over-year. CEO A.J. Kazimi said on the Q3 call that \"we believe the quarterly financial performance was actually better than it might appear\", and the company did have a tough year-prior comparison. Oncology drug Totect (dexrazoxane) benefited in Q3 2017 from a supply shortage at competitors, which drove up sales. But even accounting for that prior-year spike, the quarter looks notably disappointing. Year-to-date revenue now is down 7.6% despite the fact that Kazimi projected full-year growth on the Q1 call, and a tough comparison is on the way in Q4. Broad performance is concerning - and the outlook isn\\'t much better. There\\'s just not much in the way of growth opportunities here. Laxative Kristalose, which drives about one-third of revenue, actually is performing reasonably well of late after trending downward for several years. Trailing twelve-month sales are roughly flat to the year-prior print. Kristalose does have some near-term potential. A co-promotion agreement with Poly Pharmaceuticals can drive sales. According to Cumberland\\'s Q3 call, the FDA has withdrawn approval for PEG (polyethylene glycol) laxatives - which could lead physicians to choose Kristalose instead. But this is not a drug with much in the way of end market growth, and it remains to be seen whether the PEG withdrawals can get the company back to the sales levels reached earlier this decade.\\n Ethyol drives over a quarter of revenue - and its outlook is similar to that of Kristalose. The product treats xerostomia (dry mouth) in cancer patients. Generic amifostine versions present competition, but with more narrow indications. Revenue is down y/y through the first nine months, but Q1 2017 saw a spike soon after a late 2016 launch, skewing the compare a bit. One issue here is royalties: Cumberland must pay Clinigen 30 to 50% of sales, and those royalties led to an unsurprising spike in SG&A expense last year. Acetadote revenue continues to decline: TTM sales are $5.4 million, a little under 15% of the total. At some point, the drug (Cumberland sells both a branded version and an authorized generic) may bottom, but any growth from these levels is highly unlikely.  Combined, the three drugs drive about three-quarters of revenue - and about half pro forma for VIBATIV. The glass-half-full view is that Kristalose, Ethyol, and Acetadote can provide a solid base for Cumberland, with growth from VIBATIV and smaller products. The converse argument, however, is that those drugs aren\\'t enough yet: Adjusted EBITDA over the past four quarters is a loss of roughly $1.6 million. For that to reverse, VIBATIV needs to be a winner - and the smaller products need to start showing growth. I\\'m skeptical on all fronts. The Rest of the Portfolio Cumberland continues to talk up the promise of its Caldolor injectable ibuprofen, with Kazimi saying a \\'next-generation\\' Caldolor (improved packaging, new formulation) would help growth in 2019. But Caldolor has been a disappointment going back to the IPO: back in 2009, Kazimi had projected \"several hundred million\" dollars in sales, but TTM revenue is under $5 million. Pricing appears to be an issue, and the product clearly has lost out to Ofirmev (now owned by Mallinckrodt (MNK)). The weak sales aren\\'t for lack of effort: Cumberland has devoted substantial resources, including multiple FDA submissions looking to expand indications and gain approval for prescriptions to children. The product simply hasn\\'t gained much traction: quarterly sales are consistently clearing $1 million, but the drug likely has been unprofitable in the decade since its launch.\\n Cumberland paid $2.3 million this month to acquire full rights to triple therapy Omeclamox Pak, used to treat gastointestinal bacetria H. pylori. The product, however, generated just $90,000 in sales in Q2, and $280K in the third quarter. Cumberland said the company is looking to contract with managed care, but here, too, price seems a stumbling block. O-Pak includes omeprazole (the generic version of branded Prilosec), along with two generic antibiotics, yet costs several hundred dollars. In early 2014, the company acquired hyponatremia (an electrolyte disorder) treatment Vaprisol from Astellas Pharma (OTCPK:ALPMY). Sales averaged nearly $1 million a quarter in the first full year: TTM revenue is about $2 million. A supply shortage led to a Q2 spike, but Q3 revenue actually was negative, with the 10-Q citing returns of expired products. The Vaprisol purchase was supposed to be an example of Cumberland picking up a forgotten drug; but it looks like Vaprisol was forgotten for good reason. And with the shortage resolved, and limited demand after that one-time spike, it\\'s tough to see much in the way of growth here. The second Clinigen drug (after Ethyol) is Totect. And the Q3 performance looks hugely concerning. As noted, sales spiked last year as competitors faced significant manufacturing shortages, reaching $2.9 million in Q3 2017. With those shortages resolved, sales have collapsed, dropping to $1.1 million in Q4 2017 and just $45 thousand in the most recent quarter.  Obviously, post-shortage inventories likely are hitting near-term results. But it seems almost certain that the performance is well below management\\'s own expectations. In response to an analyst question on the Q4 2017 call, Chief Commercial Officer Marty Cearnal said that the company expected to maintain roughly one-third market share, and that the Q4 sales of $1 million-plus \"were something of an indicator\" of future performance. Sales for the first three quarters combined are just $727,000. As for ifetroban, Kazimi noted \"inconclusive efficacy results\" from a recent trial of Portaban (for portal hypertension associated with liver disease). The CEO largely dismissed the results as \"not unexpected\", noting that trial was designed to evaluate safety, not efficacy. But Kazimi also said that the company would await the results of other Phase II studies - where, again, enrollment is taking longer than expected - before moving forward. What is now a seven-year process seems likely to take much more time. Meanwhile, the lack of movement belies the long-running optimism toward the compound, which was originally discarded by Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY) and donated to Vanderbilt University before being picked up through Cumberland\\'s partnership with the school.\\n The other cited 2019 growth driver is what will be known as RediTrex, an injectable methotrexate arthritis treatment. Cumberland picked up the exclusive U.S. rights from Nordic Group for 180K shares of stock in late 2016. Cearnal said on the Q2 call that the company expects $30 to $50 million in revenue - but why that is isn\\'t clear. Antares Pharma\\'s (ATRS) OTREXUP has generated TTM sales of about $16.6 million. Revenues are down this year, and about flat excluding a year-prior accounting change. The ATRS 10-Q attributes the YTD decline (including a sharp drop in Q3) to increased rebates and sales allowances, which have offset unit growth. Does the entrance of another product from Cumberland improve that pricing situation? And why, when Cumberland has struggled in so many competitive markets (notably with Caldolor and now, apparently Totect) is it going to win in this one? The Bear (Short?) Case Looking at Cumberland on a product-by-product basis, the question is: from where do profits come? The three established drugs do form a nice base, but as recent performance shows aren\\'t enough to drive overall profitability. Caldolor could help if it keeps trending in the right direction, but even that trend only suggests a million or two in incremental revenue - not enough to move the needle. The smaller products, particularly coming out of Q3, look to be in various stages of disarray. Vaprisol and Totect sales were near zero in the quarter - weakness that can\\'t be completely explained away by shortages. O-pak has had years to grow, and instead has gone in the wrong direction. The ifetroban pipeline has been five years away for seven years. RediTrex is a late-to-market product that, like so many other CPIX products, will face intense competition and pricing pressure. Meanwhile, to support $6+ from a profit standpoint (given a pro forma enterprise value around $75 million), CPIX probably needs at least $9 million in incremental profits to get EBITDA to $7 million-plus. Given 30-50% royalties on Ethyol and Totect and milestone payments behind RediTrex, incremental margins probably aren\\'t that strong. Even assuming the top-line grows next year behind management\\'s three cited drivers (next-gen Caldolor, RediTrex, and VIBATIV), that doesn\\'t necessarily mean earnings improve all that notably.\\n That assumption seems awfully generous. VIBATIV clearly has a number of risks, ranging from the black box warnings to competition. Cumberland\\'s own history with its own strategy, admittedly with smaller deals, has been checkered at best. That history supports a scenario here in which VIBATIV disappoints, \\'next-gen\\' Caldolor doesn\\'t move the needle, and RediTrex falls well short of management projections. CPIX stock likely takes a dive given that earnings growth will be much smaller than expected/hoped - and that its upside catalysts will be largely exhausted by that point. Such a scenario is ~12 months out, at least, depending on the timing of the RediTrex launch, and the lack of a catalyst is a problem for the short case. So is the cash remaining on the balance sheet (~$25M) and still-reasonable P/S multiples (which are in the 1x range pro forma for VIBATIV and RediTrex).  That\\'s probably enough to rule out a short - but the bull case here simply looks awfully thin. To listen to management, Cumberland has big opportunities on the way. But that\\'s been the same thing management has said going back to 2009. Not only has CPIX stock not responded, the business itself hasn\\'t shown any progress. Earnings used to be positive; now they\\'re not. Revenue is down from early-decade levels, admittedly due almost solely to the erosion of Acetadote. Management\\'s response to those declines has been either slow and/or ineffective. Buying CPIX at $6.50 requires that to change - but looking close, there are few reasons to expect that change, and many more to believe that the disappointments of the last nine years will continue going forward.\\nDisclosure: I/we have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

We came up with two familiar names - McDonald's (MCD) and Starbucks (SBUX). Both of these stocks have outperformed the market during this pullback and also have outperformed it year-to-date. Well, that makes sense, doesn't it? We all need to eat, and who hasn't had the guilty pleasure of a Big Mac or a latte at some point, although it would be a stretch to say these are really staples of any diet, unless you're talking about your average high school or college student. \\n\\nBoth stocks have received multiple upgrades from analysts - MCD has received three upgrades and two positive initiations since October: \\n\\nSBUX also has had several upbeat ratings from analysts: \\n\\n(Source: Yahoo Finance)\\n In terms of earnings estimates though, it has been a mixed bag for both of these stocks, with upward and downward revisions over the past month. MCD is net positive for full years 2018 and 2019, but it's a split decision for Q4 '18 and Q1 '19. The consensus EPS estimates are mostly flat for Q4 '18, Q1 '19 and full-year 2018, but show a 6.2% rise for 2019 vs. 2018: \\n\\n(Source: Yahoo Finance) SBUX's revisions are leaning much more toward the positive side for Q4 '18, Q1 '19 and full years 2018 and 2019, although the consensus EPS estimates look mostly flat, except for 2019 vs. 2018, which shows a 13.5% estimated rise in EPS: \\n\\n(Source: yahoo Finance) Analyst's Price Targets - MCD: At $171.42, MCD is slightly higher than analysts' lowest price target, but is 12.3% below the average $195.44 price target.  \\n\\nDividends - MCD: MCD's management raised its quarterly dividend by ~15% in November, to $1.16. MCD pays in a March/June/Sept/Dec. schedule, and should go ex-dividend again in early March. It yields ~2.71%, and has a dividend payout ratio of 55.20%, with average five-year dividend growth of 6.09%: \\n\\n\\n Options - MCD: Covered Calls: We added two trades for MCD to our free Covered Calls Table which tracks more than 30 other trades, and is updated throughout each trading day. MCD's March $180.00 call strike pays $5.60, nearly 5X the quarterly $1.16 dividend, so, on a short-term basis, you could enhance MCD's quite substantially. The flip side to that is MCD could blow right through $180.00, but you'd still only make $5.60/share on the call option. \\n\\nMCD also has a June option expiration, with a $180.00 strike bid premium of $8.65. This trade captures two ex-dividend dates for a total of $2.32 in dividend payments. Since the $180.00 strike is quite a bit above MCD's price/share, the potential price gain would be also greater than the $2.32 in dividend payouts, should your shares be assigned before the ex-dividend dates. \\n\\n MCD Put Options: We added these March and June put-selling trades to our Cash Secured Put Tables. MCD's March $165.00 put strike pays $5.35, again, much higher than the $1.16 quarterly dividend. This put option gives you a breakeven of $159.65, which is ~6% below analysts' lowest price target of $171.42 for MCD. \\n\\nGenerally, you'll get paid more for selling options further out in time, but you'll get paid less the further out of the money you sell at. This June $160.00 put strike pays $6.65, just about two times the next two dividends, and offers you a breakeven of $153.35, which is 9.8% below MCD's lowest price target:\\n \\n\\nDividends -SBUX: SBUX pays $.36, with a 2.33% yield, and has a very impressive five-year dividend growth average of 24.86%. It pays in a Feb/May/Aug.Nov. cycle, with a very conservative 16.97% dividend payout ratio. \\n\\n Options - SBUX: Covered Calls:  If you're looking to enhance your yield on a short term basis, these 2 covered call trades can do the trick. The SBUX March $65.00 call strike pays $1.85, over five times the $.36 dividend. \\n\\nThere's also a $65.00 call strike for June, which pays $3.10, over four times SBUX's two dividends during the term of this ~six-month trade. \\n\\nAnalyst's Price Targets - SBUX: At $61.87, SBUX is 12.5% above analysts' lowest price target of $55.00 and 9.9% below the average $68.64 price target. There's a 47% spread between the lowest and highest price targets for SBUX. \\n\\n\\n Cash Secured Put Options - SBUX: The March '19 $60.00 put strike pays $2.56, giving you a $57.44 breakeven, which is 4.4% above the $55.00 lowest price target for SBUX. \\n\\nMoving further out in time, to the June $60.00 put strike, would give you a $3.70 premium, which is more than five times the $.72 in dividends for the next two quarters. It gives you a $56.30 breakeven, which is ~2% above the lowest price target. \\n\\nNote: Put sellers don't receive dividends, we just list the dividends in our put tables, so viewers can compare them to the put premiums. You can see more details for these MCD and SBUX put trades, in addition to over 35 other trades, in our free Cash Secured Puts Table, which is updated throughout each trading day. If you're new to options, our Options Glossary explains the terms you'll come across using options-selling strategies. Summary: There are many other expirations and strike price levels for MCD and SBUX. If you want to be more conservative, you can sell puts even further below their current prices/share, which will offer lower option payouts, but also give you a lower breakeven. Given the higher market volatility, option premiums are currently offering much better yields than we've encountered in the past few years.

Despite better netbacks for NuVista Energy (OTCPK:OTCPK:NUVSF) compared with Kelt Exploration (OTC:OTC:KELTF), the market values Kelt at a premium. As both companies operate a similar production mix, I don\\'t see any reason to prefer Kelt Exploration over NuVista Energy at these flowing barrel valuations. \\n\\n Image source: Anita_starzycka via Pixabay All the numbers in the article (including slides) are in Canadian dollars unless otherwise noted. Q3 results The Q3 production increased by 36% YoY due to the capital program and the Pipestone acquisition. Production from the acquisition represented 2,957boe/d during Q3. \\n\\n Source: Q3 2018 MD&A The company took advantage of better liquids prices compared to last year, as shown below. \\n\\n\\n Source: Q3 2018 MD&A NuVista Energy realized gas prices way above the AECO (Canadian gas hub) prices due to the diversification to the U.S. hubs (Dawn, Malin, and Chicago). \\n\\n Source: Q3 2018 MD&A For the next quarters, the company is still diversifying its marketing with exposure to some U.S. hubs and thanks to hedges. As a result of the increased production volume and with higher realized prices, revenue increased by about 81% YoY to reach C$151 million. \\n\\n Source: Q3 2018 MD&A Adjusted funds flow amounted to C$72.6 million and capex represented C$65.8 million. But the net debt increased due to the Pipestone acquisition. Yet, despite the limited contribution of the acquired assets, the net debt to adjusted funds flow ratio is still reasonable at 1.7. Great timing for an equity issuance The C$625 million Pipestone acquisition consists of:  35,250 net acres of land. Approximately 9,600 Boe/d of production. \"Significant\" infrastructure.  The acquisition was funded with a mix of credit facilities and issuance of 47.4 million shares at a price of $8.10 per share. The results of these transactions are summarized in the table below: \\n\\n\\n Source: Q3 2018 MD&A The equity issuance was done at a great timing as the price of C$8.10 per share is close to the highest stock price since 2015. And, due to the recent volatility of oil prices, the share price dropped below C$4 shortly after the equity issuance. \\n\\nNVA data by YCharts There is, of course, a part of luck in the timing of the equity issuance. But management was opportunistic anyway considering the stock price over the past years. Flexible capital program Management maintained the 2018 production guidance in the range of 38,750 to 40,000 boe/d. The 2018 capital program is also confirmed in the range of C$325 to C$350 million. About 2019, management keeps flexibility because of the volatility of oil and gas prices. Thus, the 2019 capital program is still in a wide range of C$300-$400 million. This forecast corresponds to a production increase of about 37% compared with 2018 at 52,000 to 56,000 boe/d. For the longer term, the company still plans to grow the production above 90,000 boe/d. Valuation compared with Kelt Exploration I compare NuVista Energy with Kelt Exploration. Both companies produce a similar mix of oil and gas. Also, they both operate in the Montney area. \\n\\n Source: Author, based on companies\\' reports The table below compares the costs and netbacks for both producers. \\n\\n\\n Source: Author, based on companies\\' reports We can see that cash costs are similar. But NuVista realizes better netbacks before hedging thanks to lower DD&A costs and thanks to higher realized prices. Despite the better netbacks for NuVista, the market values it at a lower flowing barrel price compared with Kelt Exploration. \\n\\n Source: Author, based on companies\\' reports Also, it is interesting to compare the evolution of the stock price of both producers over the last years. With the reference point at the end of 2015, NuVista\\'s stock price moved higher than Kelt\\'s during most of the last three years. But the trend reversed over the last few months. From the same base three years ago, NuVista\\'s stock price moved about 14% lower compared to Kelt\\'s stock price. \\n\\nNVA data by YCharts With a similar production mix, both companies are exposed to the volatility of oil prices in the same proportions. Kelt\\'s net debt is lower than NuVista\\'s. But with a net debt to adjusted funds flow ratio at 1.7, without the full contribution of the Pipestone acquisition, NuVista\\'s net debt is reasonable. And NuVista Energy realizes higher netbacks than Kelt Exploration. Thus, I don\\'t see any reason to prefer to invest in Kelt Exploration over NuVista Energy at current flowing barrel valuations. Conclusion Thanks to improved oil prices during Q3, and with an important capital program, the company increased its revenue by more than 81%.\\n Also, management took advantage of the stock price to acquire assets issuing equity. Shortly after the equity issuance, the stock price dropped due to the volatility of oil prices. Kelt Exploration, with a similar production mix and with a lower total netback, is valued at a premium compared with NuVista. Thus, at current prices, I don\\'t see any reason to prefer Kelt exploration over NuVista.\\nDisclosure: I am/we are long PEYUF, BNEFF, BTE, CPG, SVRGF, YGRAF.

The key reasons for the \\'short\\' thesis are: likely higher than reported losses, negative price and earnings momentum, and mostly negative news (psychology). I expect to see an upward revision of reported losses given 1) market practices of relying on catastrophe loss models (which tend to underestimate losses) and 2) BCRH\\'s practices of upward revision of losses. There\\'s only so many times one can kick the can down the road, but at some point, ever increasing insurance claims are likely to catch up. Given continuously deteriorating liquidity at BCRH and low cash balance levels, it seems that the day of reckoning is not far. Personally, I\\'m currently short BCRH. I\\'m not suggesting that BCRH will experience extreme distress, but I will wait for Q4 results (expected to be published in late January) to re-evaluate the next steps. Putting short-term challenges of BCRH aside, the company represents an attractive \\'pure play\\' exposure to catastrophe insurance sub-industry and might be something to keep an eye on.    Blue Capital Reinsurance Holdings Overview We will start by talking about BCRH and then move on to an overview of the insurance industry and reinsurance sub-industry. BCRH provides reinsurance in the property catastrophe market in and outside of the United States. Some key data points about BCRH (as of December 24, 2018):  Microcap stock: $49.8M market cap High dividend yield: 21% dividend yield ($1.2 per share of annual dividend) Negative price momentum: 55% decrease in the last 52 weeks  During the latest earnings release (December 11), the company announced that impact of catastrophe losses for Q4 is estimated at $17M (mostly related to Hurricane Michael and California wildfires). Based on estimates, fully converted book value per common share is estimated to be between $11.25-$12 by the management. This announcement gave some clarity around potential losses and a glimpse of hope that it might not be as bad as feared. Initially, share price jumped by 36%, but that short-lived price action reversed back. We are back at pre-announcement price levels.\\n \\n\\n Source: Fidelity In the short-term, there doesn\\'t appear to be much good to say about BCRH. That said, when I came across the stock it drew my attention as a vehicle for retail investors to get exposure to insurance-linked securities. This would not be as clean of exposure to such product, but yet might be a good enough proxy available for the average retail investor. Why are insurance-linked securities are interesting? Because they provide exposure to an asset that is uncorrelated to more mainstream asset classes (i.e. diversification benefit) while providing reasonable rates of return (somewhere between stocks and bonds). See below a chart from BCHR presentation: \\n\\n Source: Blue Capital Reinsurance Holdings presentation   \"Short\" thesis  As noted earlier, the key reasons for the \\'short\\' thesis are: likely higher than reported losses (refer to section \\'fundamentals\\' below), negative price and earnings momentum (\\'momentum\\'), and mostly negative news (\\'psychology\\'). 1. Fundamentals How many different definitions of stock do you know? One general definition is, \"a stock represents a residual claim on profits of the company\"? So, in order to claim any stock is a candidate for shorting due to poor fundamentals, you would want to see that either current or future prospects are deteriorating. In my personal view, there are two such negative drivers of the underlying fundamental value of BCRH:  catastrophe losses related are likely underestimated, and overall industry pricing has been deteriorating for a few years now.  \\n On the first item of underestimation of losses, there are two factors that make me think that is the case: 1) BCRH has a \"habit\" of revising up the loss estimates and 2) industry models tend to underestimate losses (i.e., revisions are not particular to BCRH, it is more of \\'normal\\' market practice).  BCRH had revised their loss estimates every quarter this year. You might find more details on this first hand reviewing quarterly presentation decks for this year on BCRH\\'s website:   Q1\\'18 results: \"Experienced an increase in estimated losses related to Hurricane Irma which made landfall in Florida in September 2017\" Q3\\'18 results: YTD loss ratio was reported at 81.6%: 56.7% for the current year and 24.9% for prior year. ~25% loss ratio related to prior year!   The industry relies heavily on catastrophe loss models that, historically, have shown to underestimate ultimate losses in most cases. Please refer to results of the study conducted by JLT Re, which is presented in \"Reinsurance sub-industry overview\" section On the second item of deteriorating industry pricing, please refer to the graph below. Even though red circles show that pricing (premiums) tend to increase right after big catastrophe losses, generally global pricing index has been in a downtrend over the last 15 or so years. This, naturally, results in lower revenue. Ideally, you would have expected that costs (i.e., claims) would follow the same trend to ensure that industry bottom line stays intact. However, that is not the case. As you can see from the graph below frequency and severity of cat losses did not decrease: there’s a ‘big loss’ year every six years on average (2005, 2011, and 2017; losses of $120-$140B) and years in between these are in the range of $20-$80B. If anything, it seems that 2012—2016 interim years had higher industry loss figures on average than 2006-2010 interim years. \\n\\n\\n Source: Statista 2017 and BCRH presentation So what does all this mean \\'fundamentally\\'?  Below is one data point from the latest press release: fourth quarter results would be impacted by catastrophe losses currently estimated at $17.0 million dollars, which include losses related to Hurricane Michael, which made landfall in Florida in October 2018, as well as the 2018 California wildfires  So, for the sake of scenario analysis, let\\'s see what happens if BCRH underestimated 2018 losses by 25% (or just books it to 2019, as it happened in 2018). 25% of $17M equals ~$4M or ~8% of book value. Using a year-end $11.25 book value per share (as estimated by management), cutting 8% off would bring book value to $10.35. At the current stock price of $5.65 (by the time this article gets published number might have as well moved), it would translate to a BV multiple of 0.54x. Is 25% loss underestimation a realistic scenario or shall we consider the potential of larger magnitude? That\\'s the beauty of investing in microcaps, you don\\'t get answers to all of your questions. You can look at sub-industry practices and try to see whether specific microcap that you are reviewing is practicing something different. In the case of BCRH, it seems that underestimation is not particular to BCRH; it is just a \\'normal\\' industry practice. This, unfortunately, does not give you additional comfort, but just tells why there\\'s so much uncertainty around this company that is keeping stock price discount vs. book value at relatively sizable level. Is stock price cheap enough now to attract \"value investors\"? (perhaps \"yes\", but we will cover this item in \"Risk\" section)? Or perhaps, BCRH will continue to be \"falling knife\" forcing even value investors to stay aside until dust clears?  2. Momentum:  Unlike earlier years, BCRH has missed on earnings every quarter this year so far. Please refer to the chart below. Since Q3’17, when BCRH reported a large loss, the stock price has been on a downtrend. The last three quarterly misses, partially driven by revisions of loss estimates from catastrophes (talk about relying on models), further made BCRH story a pessimistic one.\\n \\n\\n Source: I/B/E/S Estimates and company reports 3. Psychology: Most of the relatively little research sources on BCRH are primarily negative (uninspiring earnings releases, earnings misses, and questions around BCRH’s ability to pay dividends). Furthermore, the level of stock price decrease puts BCRH among the underperformers of its sub-industry. Such a chain of negative “indicators” might exacerbate the desire to liquidate the long positions. Before we move on to industry and sub-industry overviews, let me cover off two other topics in relation to BCRH that might be of particular interest to the readers:  Market sentiment and consensus estimates Interest rate sensitivity of BCRH  Market sentiment and consensus estimates As you can see from the graph below, the consensus estimate is for a slightly larger loss in Q4\\'18 compared to Q3\\'18 miss. That said, you would also notice three quarters of earnings misses that we\\'ve discussed already. This doesn\\'t bode well for investor sentiment.  \\n\\n Source: Yahoo Finance Interest rate sensitivity of BCRH We will talk about capital market sensitivity of insurance companies in the section below. However, let\\'s take a minute to quickly review interest rate sensitivity of BCRH. Typically, you would expect insurance (and generally most of financial companies) to benefit from rate hikes. That said, impact of increasing interest rates is likely going to be immaterial in case of BCRH:\\n  BCRH mostly carries cash collateral; i.e., very low duration investments (to qualify as cash, investment maturity needs to be less than 90 days) BCRH has already burned most of its cash  In other words, BCRH has a low sensitivity to interest rates due to the nature of its investments. Underlying catastrophe reinsurance business is not much exposed to interest rates either; it\\'s mainly driven by frequency and magnitude of catastrophe losses. Insurance industry overview The insurance industry comprised mostly of property and casualty insurers (~36% of market cap of insurance companies in S&P 1500), while reinsurers make up the smallest sub-industry (~5%). Note that nearly 1/4th of property and casualty (P&C) insurers are mutual and reciprocal insurers (Liberty Mutual, Nationwide Mutual, State Farm, Farmers Insurance, etc.). Mutual insurers are owned by their policyholders, unlike their publicly traded counterparts that are owned by shareholders. In a way, mutual insurers do not have “shareholder return” considerations and might offer better-priced insurance (i.e. lower margin). The beauty of the insurance industry is that it is exposed to a different set of non-financial risks. For instance: P&C insurers are exposed to various risks of loss of property, while life insurers would be exposed to longevity risk. These couple of examples can give you some color on how the performance of underlying business can be very different from ebbs and flows of capital markets. This provides an opportunity for enterprising investor/ trader. Similar to risk premiums in capital markets (equity risk premium, volatility risk premium, etc.), risk premiums for insurance products at times get out of whack. For instance, a long period of lower than modeled catastrophe losses coupled with competitive industry tends to result in increased risk appetite (i.e. lower underwriting standards) and ultimately lower premiums. This quickly tends to reverse after major catastrophe losses when premiums tend to overshoot on the conservative side. Ajit Jain (Vice Chairman of Insurance for Berkshire Hathaway) was commended by Warren Buffett for his ability to get aggressive in righting policies right after major catastrophe when premiums tend to be very attractive. For more on this topic, you might find details in Warren Buffet’s biography (“The Snowball”).\\n That said, insurance companies are still rather exposed to capital markets in two key ways:  They invest their float in stocks, bonds, and at times in alternative investments. Net investment income can at times account for 20%-30% of insurer’s total revenues per CFRA. They raise funding in capital markets  There are other capital market risks that particular insurers might be exposed via their underwritten policies. Remember, AIG in 2018 with short credit exposure? In the hindsight, one way for a retail investor to get long CDS (not readily available product for retail investors) would have been to go short AIG shares or buying put on AIG shares in 2018. In other words, unlike commercial banks, you don’t have to wait for a credit crisis to short insurers. The nature of the business gives you more opportunities to go short even during bull markets (or specifically during a late bull market). Reinsurance sub-industry overview Reinsurers are effectively insurers of insurance companies. Similar to how you would transfer the risk of damaging your car to the insurance company when you buy auto insurance, insurance companies can similarly “buy insurance” from reinsurers. They would do so by ceding some of the risks to reinsurers in exchange for a portion of premiums they have collected on original insurance policies. Reinsurers can “buy” portion of entire risk class (e.g. auto insurance policies) from the insurance company for up to certain policy limit (first loss) or above agreed loss amount (similar to high-deductible insurance). Similar to insurers, reinsurance business is cyclical and goes through extremes of high/low premium environments. Given that our focus here is on Blue Capital Reinsurance Holdings (BCRH), we’re mostly focusing on the catastrophe reinsurance business.  As noted, typically premiums tend to increase right after major catastrophe loss. That said, CFRA noted that expectations for materially firmer premium rates in the aftermath of heavy storm losses failed to materialize in 2018 (source: “Industry Surveys: Insurance” published by CFRA in July 2018). This negatively impacts property catastrophe insurer and trickles down the chain to reinsurers as well.\\n Most of the industry relies heavily on catastrophe loss estimation models. Some develop such models internally and some rely on third-party providers. Models provide a data point for pricing policy premiums, however ultimately actual pricing depends on supply-demand and willingness of insurance companies to tighten/loosen underwriting standards. As a result, these models have practical use mostly after the fact. Once catastrophe took place, insurance companies (and reinsurers) are required to book/“write off” losses. Given that it takes some time before actual policy claims are fully honored, insurance companies rely on their models to size up/ estimate potential impact of losses that need to be booked. As you would have guessed given accounting standards do not allow reinsurers to book a range of possible outcomes, they end up using their best point estimate. So, not only that reinsurers are relying on models (with all model risk, backward-looking assumptions with some adjustments), but they can only use point estimate in booking “loss and loss adjustment expense”. A question: do you think insurance companies tend to end up booking a high end or low end of the range of potential losses? One might argue that they would book something in the middle of the range (it would be surprising to see the concept of accounting conservatism applied when it comes to this particular situation). Reinsurance broker JLT Re conducted a study of major Atlantic hurricanes since 2004 and found:  There’s a tendency toward significant loss underestimation Accuracy suffers due to un-modeled/ unforeseen consequences Model accuracy has, generally, improved over time  A graph from that study (see below) puts these findings into graphical form. As JLT Re team noted, that hurricanes that strike highly populated urban areas tend to lead to “unforeseen consequences that cause losses to spiral”. \\n\\n\\n Source: JLT Re Risks to Shorting Company-specific items that make shorting a risky proposition:  Book value: BCRH management estimate of the book value at $11.25-$12 by YE’18 vs. recent closing price of $5.65; i.e. BV multiple of 0.5x (or 0.4x if compared to $13.15 book value of Q3’18) Strategic shareholder support: Sompro International (large Japanese insurer) holds 33% investment in BCRH. There is a chance that Sompro might step in to provide backstop funding to BCRH. Sizable price jumps might squeeze some of the shorts: stock went from $5.37 to $7.29 in a couple of days (from December 11 to 13) printing 36% jump and recently retreated back to $5.65 (closing price on December 24). Transparency: generally, there’s lower coverage and information available for microcaps  When it comes to BV multiple, as shown in the graph below, BCRH is actually not excessively undervalued relative to its peers. \\n\\n Source: CapitalIQ But again, by saying that BCRH is not “excessively undervalued relative to its peers”, am I not relying on the model as well (public comps model for valuation of a company)? Perhaps, I should learn from the insurance industry and put some qualifiers and provide ranges for my price estimates. Or, perhaps, I should altogether avoid providing any price range estimate (you probably have heard about the accuracy of analyst forecasts). Implementation Given the risks of price jumps, it might be prudent to identify exit point before shorting the stock (this is typically a good idea regardless of whether you go long or short the stock). In other words, determine how much price needs to go up before you conclude that shorting BCRH was the wrong decision. In a meantime, don’t forget that this is high dividend stock, meaning that every quarterly dividend payment would come out of your pocket if you end up shorting the stock.\\n For reference purposes only (not an investment recommendation): my average entry price is $6.3 and stop-loss is placed at $8. I will consider moving stop-loss level if price decline continues. That decision would require thinking about risks of getting whipsawed (if stop-loss is too tight) and giving back all the gains (if trend truly reverses).   Conclusion For the reasons noted above, I am not putting specific price target. Instead, I\\'m just saying that for the reasons noted in “Short thesis” section, I personally think that BCRH has more headwinds than tailwinds.  Let me conclude by renumerating arguments for going short: 1) likely higher losses than estimated by management and models, 2) negative momentum, and 3) pessimistic market sentiment. Investing is not risk-free business and I do not claim to have a crystal ball.  Even though I’m currently short BCRH, I plan to keep an eye on this stock to see if it can survive the next recession. If it does, I’m likely to add BCRH to my core portfolio as “strategic” allocation/ proxy for insurance-linked products. In a meantime, happy holiday season to all the readers! Don’t forget to subscribe if you like this article. Your comments and suggestions are welcome (as always).  Disclosure: I am/we are short BCRH.

      "{'article_name': \"Facebook's Fair Value Estimate\", 'time': None, 'symbol': None, 'class': None, 'company_name': None, 'bus_desc': None, 'summary': 'Facebook shares have declined 38% since July, based on various company specific and macro-economic developments.The company management is taking measures to overcome these obstacles.I have calculated the fair value of Facebook shares, using a discounted cash flow method.', 'article': \"Overview Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) shares have declined 38% since July, and a growing number of issues have led to this decline, including regulatory pressures, data scandals, lower projected revenues by the company management in earnings conference calls and the broad market negativity. \\n\\n (Source – Morningstar) To add salt to the wound, some well reputed brokerage firms and investment banks have lowered their price targets for Facebook, over the last couple of months. Since then, two camps have emerged in the investing community, with two contrasting views on the future of Facebook. One camp believes that Facebook will continue to shred its market value and company profits will decline, and on the contrary, the other camp believes that Facebook’s decline was undue and irrational, and Facebook will continue to gain its footing and remain the number one advertising platform of the world. In this analysis, I try to identify the reasons behind the share price crash and what the company management is doing to overcome the difficult times and achieve sustainable growth in profits. Thereafter, I focus on assigning a buy/sell rating to the company, based on an intrinsic value estimate. Why did Facebook shares decline 38% in 5 months? During the Q2 earnings conference call in July, the company management projected a decline in operating margins in the future, as the company plans to invest billions of dollars to improve safety measures to prevent data scandals from happening in the future. On the other hand, Facebook will look and feel different in the future, as the company is planning to prioritize Stories over the News Feed. Management commentary in the Q2 earnings conference call triggered the very first move in Facebook’s 38% decline. In fact, the stock lost 20% upon releasing its earnings and concluding the conference call.\\n Secondly, Facebook as a company was involved in a series of data scandals and has attracted scrutiny of various law-makers, around the globe. In September, Facebook announced a major security breach in which hackers were able to use a vulnerable portion of Facebook’s platform to access accounts of more than 50 million users. More recently, in December, A New York Times report claimed that Facebook was providing user information to major tech companies including Apple, Netflix and Google, regardless of privacy settings of users. These data scandals, coupled with a series of regulatory crackdowns on Facebook, contributed to the share price decline since July. Thirdly, senior executives started leaving Facebook, and this was seen as a major negative sign for Facebook’s future. The departure of these senior executives was seen as proof of the deteriorating future prospects of the company, and investors were keen to punish Facebook for not being able to retain top level talent. Below is a summary of executives who decided to leave Facebook in this year so far.   Name Nature of employment   Jan Koum Co-founder of WhatsApp   Elliot Schrage Head of communications and public policy   Colin Stretch Facebook’s top lawyer   Alex Stamos Chief Security Officer   Dan Rose Vice President of partnerships   Alex Hardiman Head of news products   Kevin Systrom Instagram co-founder   Mike Krieger Instagram co-founder   (Source – Data collected from company filings and CNBC) This extensive list constitutes of some executives who have already resigned, and others who have announced of their departures in the coming months. Investors are fair to raise concerns over these high profile departures, as a company’s eco-system is built around its senior executives. Fourthly, the introduction of the General Data Protection Regulation (GPDR) has made company’s survival in the European region more difficult, and Facebook has already lost millions of users in this region, since the introduction of these strict privacy rules. The advertising business of Facebook in the European region is expected to take a permanent hit with the implementation of GPDR. In line with these lower revenue expectations from the all-important European region, investors were quick to dump their Facebook shares, which paved the way for the massive erosion in market capitalization since July.\\n Among other reasons, the broad market negativity played its part as well. Since September, overall markets took a beating as part of the yield curve inverted, trade tensions rose and political woes continued to persist. What is Facebook doing to overcome these issues? Investors need to assess the present situation of Facebook by weighing in the positives against the negatives. Understanding why Facebook share price declined over the last few months does not provide an insight in to the future performance of the company. In this segment of the analysis, I focus on the initiatives taken by the company management so far, to tackle prevailing issues. On the earnings front, the company has revealed new plans to monetize its massive user base. Facebook still has access to a massive user base, which the company is not monetizing at the moment. WhatsApp is a prime example of such a user base, and the company has not fully monetized the Instagram user base as well. Facebook has 2 billion monthly active users \\n\\n (Source – Company presentation) In my opinion, investors need not base their focus on identifying whether Facebook’s monthly active user base is growing or not. The primary reason behind this is that Facebook is approaching its maturity now, and the company will of course not be able to grow its active user base in perpetuity. The focus here should be on how Facebook can continue to monetize a user base of more than 2 billion, while retaining this user base. Despite regulatory concerns, security breaches and data scandals, social media remains an important aspect of today’s society, and Facebook is the clear leader in this segment by miles. Instagram TV, Facebook Watch, monetizing WhatsApp and Messenger are all formidable plans, which would lead to a higher revenue base for the company.\\n On the other hand, margins will continue to compress as the company will invest significant amounts to improve security. However, improved security levels will help resurrect the trustworthiness of the brand, which is healthy for the long-term outlook of the company. Therefore, even if the company has to sacrifice current year profits to secure its competitive advantage and future profitability, this should not be seen as a negative trend. In any case, margins will still be significantly higher than its identifiable peers. \\n\\n (Source - Author prepared based on company filings) On the safety and security front, the company has taken a few measures to prevent data scandals from happening, and billions of dollars have been allocated to fund such measures. \\n\\n (Source - Author prepared based on company filings) In line with the roadmap released in 2016, the company is ramping up its investments to improve security measures until the end of 2019. While a company would never be able to fully tackle security threats, taking actions and being proactive so as not to encourage security breaches is the key, as is identified by Mark Zuckerberg.  We're judging our success by, go through all of the categories of harmful content and behavior, whether it's terrorism, or self-harm, or hate speech, or just any different kind of thing that you'd be worried about. We're judging our success by how proactive can we get, so what percent of the stuff that we're taking down are we identifying before other people identify it for us. We've started issuing transparency reports so we can be held publicly accountable on this. – Mark Zuckerberg, CEO \\n Facebook’s investments in improving security measures include doubling its security staff by adding contractors, security engineers and deploying artificial intelligence to identify possible security breaches. In my opinion, Facebook will never be able to eradicate security breaches or data scandals, but mitigating the impact of such occurrences should remain the primary focus, which is exactly what the company is focusing on at the moment. Next, Facebook is focused on bringing in top talent to replace the senior executives who left and are planning to leave. Facebook continues to remain one of the best places to work (number 07 in the United States), and this, coupled with the brand value of the company, should help Facebook attract top-notch talent. \\n\\n (Source – Glassdoor) Facebook has already hired the former deputy prime minister of the United Kingdom, Sir Nick Klegg, as the head of its global affairs and communications team. A number of resigning executives have indicated that they will support a smooth transition by assisting the process of recruiting top quality talent to replace their roles. To the credit of the management, they have identified the major risks the company is exposed to, and is working toward mitigating the impact of these issues on future earnings of the company. What’s more, the management has openly admitted of their willingness to trade current profits to achieve future sustainability, which is brave and commendable. Fair value estimate Many investment publications have recently focused on identifying the issues surrounding Facebook, and declaring that the company is not an attractive investment at the moment. On the contrary, bulls have emphasized on how Facebook can monetize its user base and grow, and claimed the company is a very attractive investment at present. However, I believe a company cannot be assigned a buy or sell rating, without estimating a fair value for its shares.\\n To arrive at a fair value estimate for Facebook, I have used a Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) method, with a 5-year forecast period. Terminal value is calculated using EBITDA multiples. Below is a discussion of the major assumptions used in arriving at the fair value estimate for Facebook. Revenue To project revenues in the forecast period, I have looked at historical revenue growth rates and applied a discount factor to reflect the maturing nature of Facebook’s business model. In addition, the company is shifting its focus from tried and tested methods and focusing on venturing into content streaming and monetizing Stories. It will take time for Facebook to understand how to drive revenue from these segments, and I believe billion dollar investments in these segments will yield comparatively lower results for a couple of years. \\n\\n (Source - Author prepared based on company filings) During the last 5 years, revenue has grown at a Compounded Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) of 51.5%. Despite this stellar revenue growth, I have estimated revenues will grow at a CAGR of 22%, from 2017 through 2022. \\n\\n (Source - Author's calculations) EBITDA margin Over the last 4 years, Facebook’s EBITDA margin has improved from 49% in 2014 to 58% in 2017. However, the Trailing Twelve Months (TTM) EBITDA margin rests at just 55%, which represents the beginning of margin deteriorations. In the coming years, operating margin will further deteriorate and this will adversely affect free cash flows, which I have incorporated into my DCF analysis.\\n \\n\\n (Source - Author prepared based on company filings) During the forecast period, I believe the EBITDA margin will continue to fall and settle for around 49% in 2022. \\n\\n (Source - Author's calculations) I forecast the EBITDA margin to fall at a faster rate till 2020, as Facebook accelerates its spending on creating original content for Facebook Watch, increase investments to improve security measures and face margin compression arising from higher administrative costs. However, beyond 2020, I expect the company to reduce its spending on security-related improvements, and on the other hand, Facebook Watch, Stories and other monetizing initiatives focused on WhatsApp and Instagram will start yielding better results on dollars spent. Based on these assumptions, I expect EBITDA margin to slightly improve from 2022 and beyond. Capital expenditures Historically, capital expenditures have accounted for less than 20% of Facebook’s revenue, but under prevailing conditions, the company is forced to spend a much higher portion of its revenue as capital expenditures. In line with this assumption, I expect capital expenditures to reach a high of around 25% - 26% of revenue, and then to settle for around 19% of company revenues. Finally, to calculate terminal value, I have used an EBITDA multiple of 9.5 times, and a discount rate of 9.5% was used throughout the process. With these assumptions, I have arrived at a fair value estimate of $158 for Facebook shares, which represents an upside of 18%.\\n \\n\\n (Source - Author prepared based on author's calculations) One major point to note is that I have used conservative assumptions in the model, from Facebook’s standards. Being one of the most-followed stocks, Facebook usually tends to trade at a premium. In addition, even though I believe growth rates will deteriorate in the forecast period, Facebook might once again grow at a faster rate beyond the forecast period, driven by the possibility of a massive success in monetizing WhatsApp and becoming a leader in the content streaming industry. To add some perspective on the conservative assumptions I have used, we can look at the consensus analyst estimate for Facebook share price, which is closer to $200, than to $150. \\n\\n (Source – Market Beat) Conclusion Facebook has attracted a lot of attention, both from bulls and bears, in the last couple of months. Facebook is one of the stocks that trade at rich valuation multiples on a constant basis, but at the current market price, value investors can look at the company as a bargain pick. Margins will continue to compress and the profitability of the company will decline momentarily, but the long-term outlook remains intact. Facebook will continue to distribute wealth to its shareholders through share buybacks as well, and shares are trading at a discount of 18% to its intrinsic value estimate.\\nDisclosure: I am/we are long FB.

What does the latest projected pricing/demand decline in DRAM and NAND mean for the memory-chip maker?My share price recommendation and future outlook.\", 'article': 'Investment Thesis The stock markets have gotten pummeled in 2018 and although I remain cautiously averse, there will be clear winners in the decade to come. Micron Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ: MU) has shown its ability to take off amidst the price boom for memory, but has also come crashing down with the subsequent weakness in prices. In the points below, I outline why it may be the time to increase your position. Look At This Rocket Ship Micron Technology\\'s stock price has largely faltered after the latest earnings release and not without good reason. Going into the call, average revenue estimates were $7.35bn and $2.96 earnings per share for the quarter. Actual revenue generated for the quarter exceeded expectations by roughly 8% or $600m while eps was relatively in-line with expectations. On the surface, all is fine and dandy with MU\\'s continued surge in growth, margins, and indelible memory technology; however, there\\'s more to the story. It\\'s easy to look at a 2.6x price-to-earnings ratio and get excited about a great company with strong growth prospects in an industry that is booming. Don\\'t take my word for it though, look at the historical performance of this business: \\n\\n (Source - Jeffery Margolf;Macrotrends) It almost looks like a stock photo you\\'d get from Google by searching for \"finance.\" All jokes aside, Micron has delivered outstanding performance over the last three years largely due to market dynamics and demand for memory. In fact, in the last 15 months alone, Micron returned $3.45bn back to investors in the form of share repurchases and even pledged in their last earnings call a commitment to deliver ~50% of free cash flow to additional share repurchases. Under the existing program, which was approved by the board last quarter, there\\'s an ~$8.2bn remaining in capacity for FY2019. I\\'ll touch on this point later, but this signal clearly shows management\\'s conviction in the business.\\n What Comes Up Must Come Down It seems as though someone flipped a switch on June 4th, 2018 when Micron hit a high of $61.39. It\\'s been a precipitous drop since that date as the stock has now fallen roughly 50%. Talk about volatility. Is this rocket ship out of fuel and now we\\'re just witnessing the boosters burning up in the atmosphere? Let\\'s delve a bit deeper. \\n\\n (Source - Yahoo Finance) The End Of Moore\\'s Law Typically, debut technology is priced markedly higher during initial launch with a predictable decline after market adoption. This trend has been observable in TVs, computers, smartphones, and just about any form of consumable technology. Moore\\'s Law has allowed for the rapid acceleration of technology, by packing in as many transistors as possible into a chip to advance its computing power. By improving and introducing new generations of chips, older models quickly become obsolete and lose their inherent value, driving price declines across older models. This ideology has persevered for over 50 years, but many industry experts now believe the end is in sight. You may ask: Where am I going with this? The key to this conclusion is that we will be facing a wall within the next decade where any advances in the next iPhone or laptop will be rather lackluster or indistinguishable. Some may argue, we\\'ve already hit this barrier at least figuratively speaking. How does this factor into Micron and its trajectory? Hint: I\\'m getting there. Memory Chip Industry Dynamics There are three major players in the memory chip space: Samsung (OTC:SSNLF), Sk Hynix (KRX: 000660), and Micron, who each control approximately 46%, 29%, and 21% of the market, respectively. In other words, this is an oligopoly where the three largest players have relative pricing control and supply of their products. As we get closer to the end of Moore\\'s Law, it becomes increasingly more expensive and difficult to procure more advanced chips, straining supply and ultimately enhancing prices. This was witnessed over the last two years due to a spike in memory chip demand and supply bottlenecks:\\n \\n\\n (Source - Enterprisetech) As 2018 has progressed, supply has now usurped demand, and as a result prices for DRAM and NAND are expected to drop dramatically. With it, MU\\'s stock price performance has also nose dived due to its reliance on maintaining margins for its products to support capital expenditures and free cash flow. Don\\'t Panic What I\\'ve outlined here is transitory. Each of the three largest players have signaled planned reductions in memory production growth and capital expenditures in order to stabilize prices. With the continued proliferation of AI and IoT, along with further data server integration to meet the needs of cloud-based computing, long-term memory needs are here to stay. There\\'s an overarching theme for the 21st century: Big data. If you believe in the large behemoths to continue disrupting the world we live in - e.g., Google (GOOGL), Amazon (AMZN), Facebook (FB), Netflix (NFLX), Apple (AAPL), do I need to continue? Then you should believe in the companies that will meet their storage (hardware) needs. I\\'m an avid believer in a future which will depend on an evolving need for memory solutions. I\\'ll use the rest of this article to highlight MU\\'s current short-term trajectory. What\\'s Next? I used a GGM/CAPM to assess the current share price for Micron with fairly conservative assumptions (at least in my view).           Pro-forma     ($m\\'s) 2019 2020 2021 2022 2023 5-year CAGR   Revenue $26,113 $26,542 $26,977 $27,862 $29,234 -0.8%   % growth rate -14.1% 1.6% 1.6% 3.3% 4.9%     Operating Income $11,739 $11,932 $12,128 $12,526 $13,142 -2.6%   % margin 45.0% 45.0% 45.0% 45.0% 45.0%     Net Income 10,877 11,055 11,237 11,606 12,177 -2.9%   % margin 41.7% 41.7% 41.7% 41.7% 41.7%     While these margins may not necessarily be reflective of the current pricing dynamic, I\\'ve factored in a 23% decline in earnings in FY\\'19 YoY. $26bn revenue projection factors in the low-end of management guidance for Q2\\'19 with a slight recovery in the second half of FY\\'19. At the same time, I\\'ve factored in $9.5bn of capital expenditures for FY\\'19 with a ~3% growth rate for the next four years. Without getting into too many of the specifics, I estimated a fair value per share of $33.54, largely in line with the current share price. While this does not leave much upside, I would also argue my model is skewed to portray extended market weakness and virtually no growth - a thesis I would largely argue against. To provide reassurance, I believe my assessment of the fair value of this business creates ample upside with a measurable lower bound. Going back to share repurchases - which I outlined earlier, this model would assert zero additional buybacks for FY\\'19. What Could Go Wrong? The memory industry is largely seen as a commoditized business now and with the entry of new market participants, especially from China, many see the continued price decline of memory. A competitor who is able to clone the existing quality of memory chips with lower prices may be able to significantly disrupt the industry. With Moore\\'s law coming to an end, the market may be drawing towards a close of innovation, where existing players will consolidate and provide standardized products on a no-frills basis, achieving economies of scale. Whoever is at the forefront of redesigning computer architecture and breaking Moore\\'s law, may become the world\\'s next tech stalwart, commanding out-sized profits for the foreseeable future.\\nDisclosure: I am/we are long MU.

Your enjoyment of it is determined by which end of it you\\'re on.\" - Alfred Hitchcock Today we look at a chemical concern trading near 52-week lows. It is cheap on a valuation basis, had recent insider buying in November and thanks to losing half its value from its highs in 2018; provides an over four percent yield. \\n\\n Company Overview: Olin Corporation (OLN) is a Clayton, Missouri based manufacturer of commodity chemicals and ammunition. Initially founded in 1892, the company has a market cap of ~$3.25 billion and employs ~6,400 throughout the world. Olin grew its scale significantly when it purchased Dow Chemical\\'s (now DowDuPont Inc. (DWDP) Chlor Alkali and Vinyl, Global Chlorinated Organics, and Global Epoxy businesses for a consideration of ~$5 billion consisting of cash ($2 billion), stock (~$2.2 billion), and liability assumption (~$0.8 billion) in 2015. Operating Segments: The company has three operating segments: Chlor Alkali Products and Vinyls, Epoxy, and Winchester. Chlor Alkali Products and Vinyls. Olin\\'s Chlor Alkali Products and Vinyls division is the global leader in chlor-alkali production and caustic soda sales, as well as the top seller of chlorine, industrial bleach, and hydrochloric acid in North America. For those unfamiliar, chlorine, caustic soda, and hydrogen are simultaneously produced through the electrolysis of salt in a fixed ratio of 1.0 ton of chlorine to 1.1 tons of caustic soda and 0.03 tons of hydrogen. This by-the-ton ratio is referred to as an electrochemical unit (ECU). Through this division, Olin has production capacity of ~5.8 million ECUs. The basic input costs in production consist of electricity, salt, ethylene, and methanol.\\n \\n\\n Source: Company Presentation Chlorine is a raw material ubiquitous in many end-products including PVC pipe, vinyls, urethanes, epoxy, water treatment chemicals, as well as other organic and inorganic chemicals. About 25% of chlorine demand comes from housing construction. Caustic soda is found in water treatment chemicals, alumina, pulp and paper, urethanes, detergents, and a variety of other organic and inorganic chemicals. In addition to being a fuel source, hydrogen is used in the production of hydrogen peroxide and hydrochloric acid. Owing to chlor alkali\\'s co-production dynamic, strong demand for one product could result in the oversupply of another. Olin competes primarily with Occidental Petroleum (OXY) and Westlake Chemical (WLK) in chlor alkali. Because chlorine, caustic soda, and ethylene dichloride are commodity chemicals, their prices are more volatile vis a vie specialty chemicals which are contracted on a situational basis and are not available from many suppliers. As a result, Olin\\'s profitability is subject to commodity chemical pricing cyclicality, which is usually a function of economic activity, especially construction. A $10/ton change in the price of chlorine results in a ~$10 million impact to the company\\'s full year (FY) EBITDA; a $10/ton change in the price of caustic soda has a $30 million effect on FYEBITDA; and a $0.01 per pound change in the price of ethylene dichloride impacts Olin\\'s FYEBITDA by ~$20 million. On the input side, a $0.01/gallon hike in the price of ethylene drops FYEBITDA by ~$3 million. The Chlor Alkali Products and Vinyls division was responsible for revenue of ~$3.0 billion and $867.6 million of Adj. EBITDA (before consideration for corporate overhead) during 3Q18YTD, representing ~56% and ~84% of totals, respectively.\\n \\n\\n Source: Company Presentation Epoxy. The company\\'s Epoxy division is responsible for the manufacture and sale of allyl chloride, epichlorohydrin, and epoxy resins as well as downstream products such as marine coatings, wind turbine blades, and water purification products. This segment accounted for 3Q18YTD revenue of ~$1.8 billion and $110.8 million of Adj. EBITDA, representing ~34% and 11% of totals, respectively. Winchester. The balance of Olin\\'s business is generated by its Winchester division, which sells sporting and small caliber military ammunition and components, and industrial cartridges. Winchester generated 3Q18YTD revenue of $511 million and Adj. EBITDA of $49 million, or 10% and 5% of totals, respectively. Approach: Olin\\'s strategy is to leverage the size of its leading production capabilities and its extensive logistics and terminal network to be the lowest cost chlor-alkali producer in the business. One example of this approach is its favorable ethylene arrangement with DowDuPont, which consists of a series of three pipeline supply agreements that mitigate operational and start-up risks. 3Q18 Results and Outlook: On October 29th, 2018, Olin reported 3Q18 Adj. net income of $0.66 per diluted share on revenue of $1.87 billion versus $0.31 per share on revenue of $1.55 billion in 3Q17. Earnings came in $0.09 worse than expectations while revenues beat the Street consensus by ~$70 million. An unfavorable product mix and lower 3Q18 domestic and export caustic soda pricing were partially to blame for the Adj. earnings miss. It should be noted that caustic soda export pricing has been negatively influenced by a prolonged, flood-induced shutdown at the Alunorte alumina refinery in Brazil that first occurred in March 2018. With that said, 3Q18 Adj. EBITDA was $398.3 million versus $265.5 million in 3Q17 as the company benefitted from improved Y/Y caustic soda, chlorine, ethylene dichloride, and epoxy pricing that more than offset higher input costs and decreased shipments in the Winchester division. Highlighting the volatility in pricing, ethylene dichloride (output) pricing has more than doubled YTD, while ethane (input) costs jumped 60% in 3Q18 over its 1H18 average. Divisionally, Chlor Alkali Products, and Vinyls sales rose 19% Y/Y to $1.05 billion while Epoxy revenue jumped 32% to $647.3 million. Overall, 3Q18 Adj. EBITDA represented Olin\\'s highest in any quarter since the acquisition of the DowDuPont businesses.\\n Along with these results, management guided Adj. EBITDA lower for 2018 from $1.3 billion to $1.26 billion, citing higher ethylene (input) costs, lower caustic soda pricing, and decreased demand for commercial ammunition as responsible for an $85 million decrease in its outlook. If you are wondering why $85 million worth of 4Q18 EBITDA shortfalls only add to a $40 million overall revision, management\\'s explanation was lacking. Either way, 4Q18E Adj. EBITDA will be down sequentially from 3Q18. Even with this dimmer outlook for the balance of the year, Olin is bullish longer-term on caustic soda pricing as net chlor alkali capacity reductions in North America, Europe, and China since 2016 combined with no meaningful capacity additions expected over the next two to three years should result in historically high operating rates to meet an expected increase in demand. If management is wrong and caustic soda prices remain depressed at current levels, Adj. EBITDA will be negatively impacted by ~$100 million in 2019 versus 2018. The company is also optimistic on epoxy pricing as it expects demand growth to outstrip global GDP. Chlorine pricing is also expected to improve with any downtick likely dampened by the addition of end users the company added with its DowDuPont businesses purchase. Before the transaction, Olin had three categories of end users; today it has nineteen. If chlorine prices remain at 4Q18 levels, it would create a $60-$75 million Adj. EBITDA tailwind in 2019 versus 2018. Longer term, management expects ECU demand to increase by ~10 million tons over the next five years while only ~2 million tons of supply come online over the same period. Based on these assumptions, Olin believes it can achieve $1.5 billion of Adj. EBITDA in the next two years. Balance Sheet & Analyst Commentary: Olin\\'s balance sheet showed $156.7 million of cash and $3.3 billion of debt at September 30th, 2018. The company paid down ~$250 million of debt during the first nine months of 2018. The cash line got a bump when a $120 million receivable for environmental insurance recoveries was received in October 2018. Net Debt to Adj. EBITDA is currently 2.5x. Management indicated that debt reduction will be a priority with a goal of reducing its leverage ratio to 2.0x\\'s sometime in 2019.\\n The board authorized a buyback of $500 million early in 2018, of which it has so far purchased ~500,000 shares, leaving $483.2 million remaining. The company currently pays a $0.20 quarterly dividend for a current yield of ~3.9%, its most recent dividend marked 92 years of consecutive quarterly distributions. Analysts have a mixed opinion of Olin as reflected by analysts\\' eight buys or outperforms and two holds. 2019 earnings estimates have dropped considerably since management guided 4Q18 expectations downward. At $2.63 about in October, the mean 2019 fully diluted net income per share is now estimated at just over $2.20 a share. Analysts\\' current median twelve-month price target is just under $30.00 a share. Board member Donald Bogus has a more optimistic outlook for Olin based on his November 2nd, 2018 purchase of 25,000 shares at $21.87. Three other officers or directors have made small buys totally approximately $135,000 since then as well. Verdict: Management lowered its near-term forecast during its last earnings call but claiming that due to longer-term supply/demand dynamics, this drop is only temporary. Management believes that chlor alkali cyclicality will be replaced by a protracted uptrend in pricing with possibly less volatility. Whether this scenario plays out remains to be seen. What is clear is Olin\\'s stock is off some 50% since its January 2018 highs and analysts\\' 2019 earnings estimates have been revised ~15% lower since Q3 results as hand-wringing continue over the outlook for the construction market. The stock is trading at under 9x\\'s 2019E EPS, 5x\\'s EV/Adj. 2018E EBITDA, and less ~.45x\\'s 2019E Sales, which collectively suggests that investors are not buying into Olin\\'s outlook. In addition, thanks to its decline in 2018, the stock yields have just over a four percent yield. This should provide some sort of floor against further declines. I have purchased a \\'watch item\\' position in Olin for my own personal account as the stock looks cheap from a longer-term basis and pays a nice dividend while awaiting a turnaround. The stock also looks like it is trying to put in a bottom in recent weeks. However, now that the House has turned over in the mid-terms, gun makers could come under additional scrutiny. While Winchester is a small part of Olin\\'s business, the company could have some \\'headline\\' risk in the coming months nonetheless. Therefore, I would not consider it a \\'core\\' holding at this time.\\n The fascination of shooting as a sport depends almost wholly on whether you are at the right or wrong end of the gun.\" - P.G.

This bodes well for Kinder Morgan.', 'article': \"By Aristofanis Papadatos Since it peaked, in early October, Kinder Morgan (KMI) has plunged 20%. Consequently, it is now trading near the all-time lows it reached almost three years ago, when it decimated its dividend. As the company is in much better shape now than it was back then, the big question is whether the stock has become a bargain. Business Overview Kinder Morgan is one of the 294 dividend-paying energy stocks. It has the largest natural gas transmission network, transporting approximately 40% of all the natural gas consumed in the U.S. It is also the largest independent transporter of petroleum products and the largest terminal operator in North America. The recent plunge of the stock has resulted from two factors. After an almost decade-long bull market, S&P entered into bear market territory this week. The plunge of the index this month has affected the vast majority of the stocks. In addition, the peak of Kinder Morgan in early October almost coincided with the peak of the oil price. Since then, the price of oil has collapsed, from $75 to $43. This dive has taken its toll on the stock price of Kinder Morgan. However, Kinder Morgan is much less dependent on the oil price than most energy companies. It operates with a fee-based model and signs long-term contracts with its customers, which are forced to pay pre-determined amounts to Kinder Morgan even if they actually transport lower volumes than expected. Thanks to this business model, 96% of the cash flows of Kinder Morgan are either fee-based or hedged. Moreover, management has provided sensitivity figures, which show how much the cash flows of the company are affected by a change in the price of oil and natural gas. For every $1 per barrel decrease in the price of oil, the distributable cash flow [DCF] decreases by only $7M. Management has provided guidance for DCF of $4.6B for this year, based on an average oil price of $56.5. As this year has approached its end, this year’s results will not be affected much by the recent decline of the oil price. In 2019, if we assume an average oil price around $43 as a worst-case scenario, the annual DCF will decrease by only $0.1B or 2%. Therefore, the dramatic move of the stock price of Kinder Morgan seems overblown, at least on the surface.\\n Growth U.S. oil producers have proved resilient even amid suppressed oil prices in recent years. The total U.S. oil production has reached record levels this year and is expected by EIA to climb to new all-time highs, around 12.0M barrels per day in 2019. Moreover, the U.S. production of natural gas is expected to grow by 40% over the next decade, in tandem with the demand growth. The sustained increase in the U.S. production of oil and natural gas will be a major growth driver for Kinder Morgan in the upcoming years. Debt The debt load is a major issue for Kinder Morgan. The company invested heavily in numerous growth projects for years but it also distributed extremely generous dividends during those years. As a result, it accumulated a huge amount of debt and was forced to slash its dividend by 75% almost three years ago. Since Kinder Morgan cut its dividend, it has somewhat improved its balance sheet. Its net debt (as per Buffett, net debt = total liabilities – cash – receivables) has dropped from $47.2B in 2014 to $40.6B in the most recent quarter. Moreover, the company has reduced its leverage (debt/EBITDA) to 4.6 and expects to fund next year’s dividend and most capital expenses via its cash flows. Furthermore, it has not issued new shares in the last three years and has received positive outlook from the rating agencies. Overall, Kinder Morgan has moved in the right direction and has thus reduced its leverage. On the other hand, its interest expense still consumes essentially half of its operating income and hence the company still has a long way to go to reduce its risk exposure. In addition, while no debt matured this year, the company has a heavy schedule of debt maturities over the next four years, with about $2.5 B of debt maturing every year on average. \\n\\n\\n Source: Investor Presentation This loaded schedule of debt maturities will limit the financial flexibility of Kinder Morgan and will be a significant burden in the upcoming years, particularly if interest rates remain on the rise, as the company will have to roll over a great portion of this debt. Valuation As Kinder Morgan has provided guidance for DCF around $2.05 per share this year, it is now trading at a price-to-DCF ratio of 7.2. This is a markedly cheap valuation level. On the one hand, the market is justified to punish the stock for its high debt load. On the other hand, if the company continues to strengthen its balance sheet in the upcoming years, its valuation will revert to more reasonable levels, around 10.0, and hence the stock will enjoy a boost, not only from growing DCF, but also from the expansion of its valuation level. Final Thoughts  Since Kinder Morgan slashed its dividend, in early 2016, it has been moving in the right direction. It has slowly improved its financial position and is poised to grow its cash flows thanks to the exciting prospects of the U.S. production of oil and natural gas. On the other hand, as a bear market has just begun (and there's no telling if it will be over in a week or 3 years), we prefer not to recommend purchasing Kinder Morgan due to its still high leverage. The collapse of the oil price and the onset of a bear market have resulted in extreme beating of several other energy stocks. Exxon Mobil (XOM) is currently offering a 5.0% dividend yield, which is somewhat lower than the 5.4% yield of Kinder Morgan, but Exxon Mobil has a rock-solid balance sheet. Moreover, Magellan Midstream Partners (MMP), an exemplary midstream LP, is offering a 7.2% yield and has a much stronger balance sheet than Kinder Morgan. Overall, while Kinder Morgan is attractively valued, we advise investors to look at other energy stocks, which are more attractive right now.\\nDisclosure: I am/we are long XOM.

That’s a decline of 1,507 units.Jaguar sold 949 units of the i-Pace in Norway in Q4. As the first direct competitor to Tesla, it’s obvious that this was the chief source of Tesla’s decline.Norway’s overall battery-electric vehicle (BEV) market was up 38% this quarter, but yet Tesla was down 40%. That’s a disaster.Clearly the Model 3 will be of great benefit to Tesla’s sales numbers when it arrives in Europe, but that’s not the only thing that changes in early 2019.Audi also starts its eTron deliveries in Q1, Kia has two models with 230 miles of range, and by June the 230-mile range Nissan LEAF arrives.', 'article': \" As everyone watching the electric car industry knows, Norway is the undisputed “ground zero” for EV sales. Pure EVs (BEV, battery-electric vehicles) accounted for 41% of all car sales in Norway in November 2018, and plug-in hybrids (PHEVs) added another 16%, for a total of 57% of the market: EV Sales. No other country comes close. As I am writing this, just before Midnight Norway time on Dec. 27, there are obviously a few short days left this quarter. It's impossible to say what residual sales are going to be in these final four days, but consider that what’s left beyond Friday is a weekend - when traditionally few new cars are registered in Norway and New Year’s Eve. Looking at the daily registration statistics, very few electric cars are registered on weekends in Norway. Eyeballing the statistics I grab from this site - Registreringer av nye elbiler i Norge - every day, there are usually 300-400 EVs registered per weekday, but only 20-50 per day on a weekend. One senses that’s more of an administrative spillover than anything else. Also, for Dec. 24, 25 and 26 almost zero EVs were registered in Norway, per the reference site cited above. The market awoke on Dec. 27 with 197 units registered on the day, when I took the temperature a bit after 9 p.m. local Norway time. The point of the nuance described above is to say this: It doesn’t look like the remaining selling days in December will change the numbers you are about to see below, to any material extent. Obviously anything remains possible, including a big potential fleet sale in which an automaker could sell 200 or whatever cars to a rental car company, a taxi fleet, or something like that. We shall see whether that happens or not. But retail sales don’t look like they will move these numbers materially before the year ends.\\n Norway is an important market for Tesla (TSLA) for two reasons. To date since inception, Tesla has sold 19,812 Model S units and 11,147 Model X units. So that’s approximately 30,000 in total. This year, it sold 3,682 Model S and 4,946 units. That’s the first reason. The second reason is that Norway is the bellwether market for electric cars. Other than just the 41% BEV market share discussed above, it's important for two other reasons:  Unlike markets such as The Netherlands, there was no recent, and will be no imminent, major change in EV subsidies in Norway. Therefore, there have not been any - and will not be any in 2019 - major distortions in sales statistics, as people buy more or fewer EVs in advance on a change in subsidies. The Norwegian numbers therefore more accurately reflect real market trends. Because Norway is by far the leader in EV sales, it gets priority for new models coming to market. The public also is more educated on EVs, and has therefore become the worldwide EV trendsetter.  With all that said, let’s see how Tesla did in Norway’s Q4 (through Dec. 27) and compare with the prior year:                  2018 Q4 Norway 2018 Oct 2018 Nov Dec 1-27 2018 Q4 Q/Q change 2017 Oct 2017 Nov 2017 Dec 2017 Q4   1 Nissan LEAF 1629 1529 891 4049 162% 646 556 345 1547   2 VW eGolf 1145 1074 907 3126 32% 1235 488 649 2372   3 BMW i3 595 786 463 1844 31% 462 408 539 1409   4 Tesla Model X 123 250 980 1353 -34% 130 497 1430 2057   5 Renault Zoe 426 481 308 1215 84% 21 218 423 662   6 Hyundai Ioniq 292 587 330 1209 96% 176 246 194 616   7 Kia Soul 381 262 285 928 -22% 393 481 316 1190   8 Jaguar i-Pace 443 341 165 949 N/A 0 0 0 0   9 Tesla Model S 86 215 596 897 -47% 165 502 1033 1700   10 Hyundai Kona 54 134 176 364 N/A 0 0 0 0     TOTAL TOP 10 5174 5659 5101 15934 38% 3228 3396 4929 11553                             Others (11-lower) 582 737 542 1861 25% 551 566 369 1486     TOTAL NORWAY 5756 6396 5643 17795 36% 3779 3962 5298 13039                             TESLA TOTAL 209 465 1576 2250 -40% 295 999 2463 3757     Jaguar 443 341 165 949 N/A 0 0 0 0                             Tesla loss       1507               Jaguar % of loss       63%             Source: Registreringer av nye elbiler i Norge As you can see in the table above, here are the four main points you need to understand from this table, as it pertains to how Tesla lost market share to one car in particular:  Tesla’s sales are down 40% this quarter, compared to Q4 a year ago. Obviously that number will shrink by perhaps at least 1% in the remaining days of December, but it probably won’t be a material number for all the reasons discussed above. This Tesla decline was 1,507 units (3,757 minus 2,250). Jaguar entered the market in the fall of 2018 (zero sales in 2017) and posted 949 units for the quarter to date. 949 units of Jaguar sales is 63% of Tesla’s decline (1,507) units.  Obviously nobody can say for sure that Tesla lost all of those 949 units to Jaguar (TTM). In fact, they probably didn’t. Some Tesla losses went to other EVs as well. However, I can make a good case as to why it’s probably a good assumption that Tesla lost these sales primarily to Jaguar. The reason is simply this: Jaguar i-Pace is the only new car in the market in the same price and performance class as Tesla. All the other cars are far less expensive cars, with less horsepower and no all-wheel drive: Nissan (OTCPK:NSANY), Volkswagen (OTCPK:VLKAF), BMW (OTCPK:BMWYY), Renault (OTC:RNSDF), Kia (OTCPK:KIMTF) and Hyundai (OTCPK:HYMLF) - all of them, without exception. In fact, when you consider the totality of the picture in Norway, Q4 was a total disaster for Tesla. The BEV market as a whole was up 36% (top 10 sellers were up 38%), but Tesla was down 40%. If that is not the definition of disaster, I don’t know what is. Instead, the Jaguar i-Pace showed up and grabbed 5% of the entire Norwegian BEV market in Q4 - 949 units out of 17,795. This new market entrant - the first to go up directly against Tesla in the luxury BEV segment - posted a number that constituted 63% of Tesla’s reduction in sales. Of course, as I said above, we can’t say for sure that Jaguar took this 5% market share from Tesla, but c’mon - this is about as clear a trace as one could possibly make it, without having photographic evidence and sworn statements by the people who bought the Jaguar. The fingerprints are very damning here, as I think should be obvious to anyone.\\n I could have waited almost a week to publish this article, and the final numbers will naturally shift these numbers by a hair. However, the value of this article is to a large extent that you are likely getting to almost 99% of the final answer, a few days early, given the sleepy holidays that remain this year. The investment conclusion for Tesla here is this: When the first direct competitor showed up in the world’s most advanced electric car market, Tesla’s sales dropped 40%. If that’s the impact of the Jaguar i-Pace, then what do you think the impact will be when Audi (OTCPK:AUDVF) starts deliveries of the eTron in Q1 2019? By all accounts, Audi (OTCPK:VLKAF) is a far bigger brand than Jaguar in this part of Europe, including having more dealerships. One final word about the Tesla Model 3: I know what you are going to say - the Model 3 is coming, and Tesla’s CEO has promised its arrival on European soil in February 2019. It obviously looks to become a strong seller among the electric cars. There is no question that it will help Tesla’s sales at that time. However, keep in mind that there are two additional factors that kick into place in the first half of 2019 as well:  If Tesla loses Model S and X sales to new competitors from Jaguar and Audi, it will take even more Model 3 units to make up for the lost margin on those more expensive vehicles. Audi and Jaguar won’t be the only new entrants in the market. In terms of less expensive cars, the Kia Niro and revised 230-mile range Kia Soul will enter the market in Q1 as well. Then, by June 2019, the Nissan LEAF with its new 230 mile range battery also will be in the market. Those will compete against Tesla Model 3 - not so much the Model S and X.  Conclusion: The Model 3 will help Tesla’s sales in Europe. However, the competitive wall is coming up fast, and it already had a huge impact in Q4.

      "{'article_name': 'USD/JPY Remains Under Pressure', 'time': None, 'symbol': None, 'class': None, 'company_name': None, 'bus_desc': None, 'summary': \"The USD/JPY, often viewed as a leading indicator of risk-on activity, is exhibiting weakness. The question is whether this weakness is likely to continue.It is of the author's opinion that USD/JPY is likely to fall further than its recent lows of around 110. A short to medium term target could be 109.This prediction rests on the fact that the pair has showed no ability to surpass 114 in recent times.Since the beginning of 2017, a failure to achieve a sustained break over the 114 level has invariably resulted in a return to a price under 109 in the subsequent short to medium term.While this time it may be different, the author believes that the current base case for USD/JPY is a return to under 109 within the next one to four weeks.\", 'article': \" In a recent article published December 19, 2018, I warned that USD/JPY had further room to fall. Very shortly after the article, USD/JPY dropped below my downside target of 111.750, without showing any positive retracement to the upside beforehand. Now, at the (present) time of writing, the USD/JPY pair is currently trading in the region of 111.000, after having fallen to a low of 110.269 on Christmas Eve (on December 24, 2018). The USD/JPY pair often serves as a useful, leading indicator for equities and other asset classes (by virtue of signaling risk-on activity when the pair is positive). It is therefore once again pertinent to ask: what is next for USD/JPY? In the author's view, it is probable that the pair finds it way lower; with an initial target of 109.000. Key Levels for USD/JPY The near-term, daily chart for USD/JPY probably does not provide us with enough information to make any prediction as to the pair's future direction, at least not with much conviction. The daily chart below shows that the pair has recently hit similar lows to the intraday low of 110.380 achieved previously on September 7, 2018 (marked by the black line). \\n\\n\\n (The chart above was created by the author using TradingView.com charting tools. This also supplies to any other chart images presented hereafter.) This level of 110.380 seems to line up well with the recent lows, but will this level likely provide support for USD/JPY? Will the pair now bounce and rise ardently, saving the pair from falling further? It is of the author's opinion that the answer to all these questions is no; negative. Instead, a more likely scenario is that USD/JPY drops to 109.000 (or lower). USD/JPY Could Be Targeting 109 Firstly, note that the pair has already approached 110.000, a round number. Round numbers are often used as targets, not just by traders, but by institutions who are looking to process large currency transactions. And it is precisely institutional order flow that we must keep in mind when predicting currency pair movements. While the pair has not actually recently met 110.000, we should put the recent bearishness in the pair in context of the fact that the pair has already failed several times to sustain itself above 114.500. As depicted in the chart below, in the red highlighted area, USD/JPY has not demonstrated sufficient lift. It is precisely the lower highs shown in this highlighted area that I warned of previously. \\n\\n In the author's view, it is unlikely that the USD/JPY pair attempts these levels again any time soon. If the pair does try for these levels, the price would unlikely hold. It seemed logical for the price to fall. Yet now that it has fallen to almost 110.000, could it fall further? We return to the question at hand. The answer to the question of whether USD/JPY could fall to 110.000 and below becomes immediately clearer when viewing the above chart on the longer-term, weekly chart. Notice that since the beginning of 2017, each time USD/JPY approached or exceeded the 114.000 level, it invariably returned at some point (in the short to medium term) to at least 108.802 (or lower).\\n The chart below illustrates this, by not only keeping the previous illustrations provided in the above charts, but by also marking the levels of 114.000 in red, and 108.802 in dark green. (It is also a weekly chart, as mentioned before.) \\n\\nIt is for this reason that we can reasonably estimate that the next target for USD/JPY is approximately 108.802. Given the recent performance of USD/JPY, combined with the far less fervent risk sentiment demonstrated by equities and other risk-on assets most recently, it is very unlikely that USD/JPY breaks long-term highs beyond 114.000 any time soon. Therefore, the USD/JPY pair is likely to remain biased to the downside. The question then becomes, how far will the pair fall? And the logic presented heretofore would suggest that 108.802 is a probable target. While the pair may see further, minor retracements to the upside, the author believes that USD/JPY will meet with 108.802 within the next one to four weeks. As a side note, it is important to remember that divergences can occur between USD/JPY and equities. While further weakness in the USD/JPY pair could support further equity outflows (and thus equity under-performance), the positive correlation between the USD/JPY pair and equities do not always hold. This prediction therefore does not necessarily suggest that equities will also likely see downside in the near term. However, this prediction would encourage prudent cautiousness in all risk assets over the next four weeks, into the new year of 2019.

We think the company will be forced by shareholders to deleverage in 2019.', 'article': 'Investment Thesis AT&T (T) owns a few slow and no-growth businesses that are far from exciting, but the company is a cash-generating machine. We think the company is currently being forced to deleverage by investors that worry about rising interest rates eroding their equity position in the coming years. We started a position because the stock currently pays investors 7.5% to wait for the turnaround. We think investors who waited patiently as we did will benefit from starting a position at current price levels. We bought when the stock started dipping below $30 and think AT&T is a $50 stock within the next 2-3 years.  A Rapidly Increasing Debt Pile It is no secret that with the federal reserve increasing interest rates, companies with weaker balance sheets have done worse than quality companies with strong balance sheets in 2018 overall. We think this trend will likely continue until companies that over-borrowed are forced to deleverage as interest rates rise. AT&T\\'s debt has increased by 86% from $186 billion in 2013 to just under $350 billion as of September 2018. The increase in debt is largely attributed to investment in building out the next generation 5G network and primarily by acquisitions such as the recent purchase of Time Warner, which was completed in 2018. AT&T also purchased DirecTV in 2015. In total AT&T spent about $150 billion for both acquisitions, which would explain about 90% of the debt that was added over the past five years. Both acquisitions have increases AT&T\\'s profitability but have so far not been loved by analysts who are concerned that acquisitions are distracting management and leading to undue financial risk. We are confident as CEO Randall Stephenson has clearly stated that discretionary cash is going to be used for one purpose, debt reduction. The liabilities in the chart below do not include liabilities such as pensions and capital lease obligations.\\n \\n\\n Source: AT&T Investor Day The Company is Growing? Right? The recent significant increases in Annual revenue have coincided with the closing of both the DirecTV and Time Warner acquisitions. It is expected that revenue will increase when a company purchases a new business with an existing customer base. What is sometimes hard to determine is just how the existing business would have grown without an acquisition? AT&T started bundling services after the DirecTV acquisition, which naturally made it difficult to determine if revenue growth in the core business was positive. AT&T held an investor day on November 29th, 2018, to help explain the new breakdown of the business and their growth plans post-litigation with the U.S. government. AT&T\\'s mobility business experienced 5% revenue growth in the third quarter and made up 48% of the companies EBITDA. AT&T is confident that consumers will continue to spend around $200-$300 per month on \"communications\" and this will generally grow with GDP. AT&T has committed to a dividend payout ratio of 50% or more but has expressed clearly that they can still invest many billions of dollars for future growth. We believe that with the strong cash flow that AT&T generates they can invest around 20 billion dollars each year for the foreseeable future without impacting the dividend payment.  \\n\\n Source: YCHARTS AT&T has the content  Many investors continue to focus on the cash cow mobility business even though AT&T has built an impressive content library. AT&T owns CNN as well as the DC properties such as Batman and Superman just to name a few. Even though the DC movies have not performed nearly as well as the Marvel movies, with the exception of Wonder Woman, DC is still a great asset that will eventually be turned around. AT&T is looking to build a direct to consumer platform to rival the likes of Netflix because they have such a strong content asset base. We think AT&T will continue to license legacy Time Warner content but will be able to leverage scale to build a good platform. AT&T is in a better position to build a full direct-to-consumer content suite with their existing assets. Unlike Netflix, which does not have exposure to real-time news, for example, AT&Ts offering could flip a switch to offer real-time broadcast content direct to consumer.\\n \\n\\n Source: WarnerMedia A new way of thinking about AT&T Will investors trade AT&T stock based on the reviews for the latest Aquaman movie or the engagement with CNN compared to other broadcast news networks? We are in uncharted territory where the traditional business metrics matter in addition to new areas of opportunity. In our view, AT&T\\'s acquisition of new wireless spectrum is now as important as the performance of the upcoming Justice League follow up movie. And investors will need to adjust to this way of thinking. A lousy year at the box office could theoretically put a hold on dividend increases. AT&T has numerous assets, such as a minority stake in Hulu, which can be monetized over time and provide value to shareholders. We are in a transition period where AT&T\\'s business is no longer \"simple\" but also has hundreds of irons in the fire that will lead to future growth and value for shareholders. \\n\\n Source: AT&T Investor Day Mergers can take a while complete We think the management expectation of reducing general overhead and duplicate costs bt $1.5 billion is very reasonable. With AT&T folding up small and large organizations into the overall organization structure post-acquisition what once was two separate organizations (marketing, procurement, etc.) are rolled into one. Afterward, if headcount needs to be reduced, it can be done thoughtfully. This leads to tremendous scale and efficiency. Where we think AT&T may be taking a bit of a leap is with revenue synergies. We agree that cross-selling will be very important but on its own will not fix customers sensitivity to price and the trend of chord-cutting in the broadcast television space. Over the longer term if the merger is followed up thoughtfully, then the compound effect over time will be tremendous for shareholders. \\n \\n\\n Source: AT&T Investor Day Conclusion AT&T has a breathtaking number of assets and has evolved into more than just a mobility and communications business. AT&T is building out a robust content pipeline that will add value for years to come. We started a position because the stock currently pays investors 7.5% to wait for the turnaround. We think investors who waited patiently as we did will benefit from starting a position at current price levels. We bought when the stock started dipping below $30, and we think AT&T will be a $50 stock within the next 2-3 years.\\nDisclosure: I am/we are long T.

The purpose of this article is to update you on the recent streaming deal with Maverix Metals (OTCPK:MACIF) as well as the $8 million funds earned through a private stock placement. Both deals were aimed at cleaning up the debt on the balance sheet as well as providing cash for operations and some further exploration of the Moss mine area. I interviewed Kenneth Berry who is President, CEO, and a Director with the company. CFO Christopher Park and Communications Manager Chris Curran were also in attendance.  Here are some key takeaways from the interview. \\n\\nSource: Northern Vertex  Northern Vertex has retired the debt they had with Sprott. Maverix gives $20 million up front for the opportunity to purchase up to 3.5 million ounces of silver at 20% of the spot price. After those ounces are purchased, Maverix maintains the ability to purchase up to 50% of future silver production using the same terms. Both companies profit from the deal and it offers optionality on a potentially rising silver price for both parties. The $8 million private placement provides the company money to fund operations and should solidify the balance sheet for 2019 while the company works on optimizing the gold and silver recovery from their mine. \\n In addition to those points, Northern Vertex has options to increase exploration of the Moss mine area in the Oatman district with award winning exploration team Perry Durning and Bud Hillemeyer. \\n\\nSource: Northern Vertex In addition to the exploration upside, now that Northern Vertex has solidified their financial standing, the company is positioned to take advantage of possible expansion. Some research provided to the company shows the power of increasing both production rates and reserves in terms of market liquidity, higher market capitalization, and more analyst coverage. \\n\\nSource: Northern Vertex, Haywood Research Optionality Analysis for Maverix and Northern Vertex Here is my optionality analysis for both companies given different possible silver prices, including spot price as of time of writing the article.

If silver price does rise substantially, Maverix's total cost of silver as a percent of the spot price falls precipitously. Northern Vertex gets immediate partial monetization of their silver and higher byproduct credits, per project gold ounce, as the price of silver rises. The original project feasibility study had the AISC (all in sustaining cost) of gold at $603 given the silver byproduct credits. Since this deal was put into place, we can expect the AISC to rise somewhat due to sharing the silver profits with Maverix. However, the project is still low cost with respect to the average gold mining costs found in the industry. And Northern Vertex just eliminated a lot of risk from their balance sheet by eliminating the Sprott debt and adding to their cash reserves. This move should provide plenty of runway to optimize their mine and get to their expected production rates without having to take on additional debt. What the Deal Says About Confidence in the Project The new financing shows that streaming companies such as Maverix Metals have confidence in the company to deliver on production targets. \\n\\nSource: Northern Vertex Maverix Metals has an established streaming agreement with Pan American Silver at La Colorada in Mexico and Endeavour Mining in Burkina Faso, so it is no stranger to making deals with strong, established precious metals mining companies. But Maverix's strategy also seems to be financing smaller development projects with solid price upside. In the case of this deal with Northern Vertex, they saw an opportunity to finance a new operator and obtain undervalued silver assets that give them a very cash flow positive optionality play on the upside price for silver. \\n The best time to make this deal was right after Northern Vertex began production, had some debts to pay for developing the mine, and had not delivered the bulk of the metals in the project yet. Further, the Maverix option includes total mine output well beyond the initial 2.99 million recoverable silver ounces. The agreement agrees to purchase 100% of silver ounces up to 3.5 million. Also, the deal gives Maverix the ability to purchase 50% of silver beyond the 3.5 million ounces, suggesting Maverix thinks there is more gold and silver to be found on the property, perhaps in the Western and Eastern extensions as shown in the graphic above. Maverix is not the only company that has shown confidence in Northern Vertex to produce on the project. Sprott had provided a $100 million line of credit initially which Nortern Vertex had drawn $20 million against. I am told by management that the possibility of further financing with Sprott, should the company want to expand, is still an option as they have maintained their positive relationship. Paying off the debt early and strengthening the balance sheet certainly helps the case if they needed to use that option. What are the Risks? The main risk that I took away from the conversation with Ken Berry was that Northern Vertex is not ready to estimate their current AISC. To be fair, they have not had enough production time to calculate actual production costs plus additional expenditures to expand operations. It will take more time for data to be made available to come up with a tangible, reliable AISC number. Further, he stated that the initial production costs of gold are above the feasibility number, which was $603 per gold ounce. I am not overly worried about that right now for two reasons: a) they are early in production, and it is not abnormal to have higher costs while operations are fine tuned and b) the AISC is so low that it could rise substantially and still be way below current gold spot price of $1271.70 at time of this writing.\\n However, there is still a risk that the costs are substantially higher than the feasibility study would indicate, which would drive the overall project value down. Northern Vertex's current market cap is currently valued well below their project NPV. The research provided in the graphic above from Haywood Research shows that overall sector market caps are priced within ranges and not tied directly to project NPVs, but more on sentiment indicators like analyst coverage and overall project size. Investors have not appeared to spent enough time in precious metals sector to appropriately value projects and make their bets. As the general stock market volatility continues into 2019, I believe investors will spend time analyzing their options and find that the precious metals markets are sorely undervalued. I believe this to be an arbitrage opportunity right now for smart value investors looking at cheaply priced assets, and perhaps licking their wounds from falling stock values in the wildly popular technology sector which has been punished since October. I think the market scenario has played into Northern Vertex's hands as it has allowed them to develop the mine largely unnoticed, while still showing the ability to finance their operations with two established industry partners who know how precious metals mining works. When the broad market takes notice of the sector, Northern Vertex will likely be one of the companies that catches some of that new investor money coming in due to their relatively low level risk factors. Stay Tuned We are much closer to the Renaissance in precious metals markets than we have been since the last major market crash. The macro story is playing into the hands of precious metals, and will reward the miners and investors with key positions. Therefore, for 2019 I will be adding coverage for more companies in the precious metals sector that I also believe are undervalued. And lastly, I will continue to provide coverage for Northern Vertex throughout 2019 as production continues to ramp up and major news events happen.\\n\\nDisclosure: I/we have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. And later, you will have the opportunity to ask questions during the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Please note that today’s call is being recorded and I will be standing by should you need any assistance.\\nIt is now my pleasure to turn the conference over to Virland Johnson. Please go ahead, sir.\\nVirland Johnson\\nThank you. Good afternoon, and welcome to the Live Ventures Incorporated fiscal year-end 2018 conference call.\\nToday, the company filed its Form 10-K for its fiscal year ended September 30, 2018 with the SEC. This filing can be found on our website www.liveventures.com in the Investor Relations section as well as on the SEC website at www.sec.gov.\\nMy name is Virland Johnson, Chief Financial Officer of Live Ventures Incorporated. And joining me today are Jon Isaac, Chief Executive Officer of Live Ventures Incorporated; and Rodney Spriggs, Chief Executive Officer of Vintage Stock, Inc. Please note that some of the remarks you will hear today may contain forward-looking statements about the company’s performance, as well, there may be forward-looking statements made during the Q&A session that follow our prepared remarks.\\nThese statements are neither promises nor guarantees, and there are a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those set forth in these forward-looking statements. Additional information concerning factors that could cause actual results to materially differ from those in these forward-looking statements is contained in our filing and periodic reports filed with the SEC, copies of which are available on our website or may be requested directly from the company. Forward-looking statements are made as of today’s date, and we do not undertake any obligation to update any forward-looking statements made during today’s call.\\nThank you to everyone joining us today for our fiscal year-end 2018 call. I would also like to express my appreciation to our management and associates of Live Ventures and subsidiaries for another great year.\\nDuring our call today, we will briefly cover our company’s operating and financial results for the year, and then answer your questions at the end of our comments. Some operating results and highlights for the fiscal year 2018.\\nThe company reported record annual revenue of $199.6 million, representing an increase of 31.3% over last year and fiscal 2018 earnings per basic share of $3.01. Hard-surface products revenue $17.9 million continues to grow now at 49.5% year-over-year. Hard-surface products gross profits were up 50.9% year-over-year due to increased sales efforts.\\nFor the year, gross profit was $74.2 million, which is up 18.6% from last year. In addition, our operating income was $10.8 million, compared to last year of $18.1 million and net income was $5.9 million, compared to $6.5 million last year.\\nFor the year, our gross profit margin was down to 37.2% and operating income margin was down to 5.4%. This compares to the prior year when our gross profit margin was 41.1% and operating income margin was 11.9%. Cost of new product, sales levels and mix of products negatively affected gross margins realized in the year for both Vintage and ApplianceSmart.\\nThe company finalized its purchase price allocation and fair value assessment regarding the ApplianceSmart acquisition and recognized a bargain purchase gain, net of deferred tax of $7.2 million.\\n\\nSubsequent to year-end on December 21, 2018, Marquis Industries sold two synthetic turf extrusion lines for $4.75 million, plus the book value of the raw material operating and packing inventories associated with the synthetic turf extrusion lines for a total purchase price of approximately $5.5 million, plus $0.10 per pound of nylon sold by the buyer during the 36 months period after December 21, 2018.\\nTax reform reduced the federal corporate income tax rate for the company from 35% to 21%. For the 12 months ended September 30, 2018, we recorded an additional $3 million of tax expense due to deferred tax asset revaluation.\\nAs of September 30, 2018, the company reported approximately $2 million of cash on hand, plus an additional $7.4 million of available credit under the company’s revolving lines of credit.\\nNet cash provided from operating activities for the 12 months ended September 30, 2018 was $11.8 million, an increase of 50.2%, or $3.9 million. Stockholders’ equity increased approximately 17.5% to $39.4 million over our year ended September 30, 2017.\\nIn June of 2018, the company successfully refinanced its Captiala term debt facility with a new term debt facility provided by Comvest at favorable interest rates. The company also negotiated a revised Texas Capital Bank revolving facility with an improved interest rate.\\nIn connection with the refinancing, the company charged-off $742,000 in unamortized debt issuance cost as interest expense. For additional financial information and details, I invite you to review our press release filed this morning and view our SEC filings on either our website or on the SEC’s website.\\nFor all those on the call, thank you very much for your participation on this call and your continued interest in Live Ventures Incorporated.\\nAt this time, we will take comments and questions from those that are on the call. Jon and I will – and Rodney will be standing by to answer them. So please use the system to announce if you have a question or not.\\nQuestion-and-Answer Session\\nOperator\\n[Operator Instructions]\\nJon Isaac\\nThis is Jon, question from Joseph.\\nUnidentified Analyst\\nHi, good afternoon. The quarter sounds or the year sounds really good and continues to look good. The company continues to look good. I just wonder about apparently people don’t know about the company. And while I don’t think it’s your job necessarily to spread the word about it, how does that happen? So that eventually, people do get interested in it and by people, I mean, mutual funds, other, they invest in public?\\nVirland Johnson\\nThat’s heavily a function of Investor Relations and that’s something that we continue to improve. Over the last couple of years, we’ve been focused mostly on the operations and building our balance sheet and our P&L. But that’s something that definitely we want to spend more effort and more resources and time in investing in this.\\nUnidentified Analyst\\nBut as I said, I don’t really think – I don’t necessarily want to see the company spending a lot of time and effort in that area. I think, you’re right. I think focusing on the company itself is the key and that eventually people will learn about it. I just wonder in general, how people find out, because there are so many companies that are out there, and – but pretty much answer that?\\nVirland Johnson\\nOne of the other things to consider is that, mutual funds and hedge funds that have hundreds of millions of dollars, billions of dollars, also don’t want to take huge stakes in companies that have a low valuation. So we’re sort of in this land where we’re not very valuable at this point.\\nBut I think, as you said, you’re right in time as we get bigger and our story becomes – people become more aware of our story, I think that more mutual funds would be – would take an interest. But I do believe that from the public filings that we do have Vanguard or a couple of other big names that have taken positions in our company. But I think some of them may be reluctant in taking the position that makes them a filer or greater than 4.9 or greater than 9.9 owners in the company.\\n\\nUnidentified Analyst\\nThank you.\\nVirland Johnson\\nThank you for your question.\\nOperator\\n[Operator Instructions]\\nVirland Johnson\\nIt’s been an exciting year, $200 million of revenue. I think a lot of investors, shareholders should realize that it was just a few years ago that our revenues was $3 million, $4 million, losing money, 11 employees, I think now we’re at $200 million profitable – we’ve been profitable for, I think, seven, eight consecutive quarters.\\nI think over 1,100 employees and counting, we’re also, for anyone that is on the call as well, we’re always looking for acquisitions. If you have any, we’re looking at a couple, as we speak. We think 2019 is going to be a good year. We’re excited.\\nJon Isaac\\nWe’re going to be opening up some new stores.\\nVirland Johnson\\nYes. Rodney, maybe you can give us a little bit about what you’re seeing on year-end, because your division represents almost half of the company’s revenues. Give us a snapshot of what you’re seeing, then we can take a question from JP?\\nRodney Spriggs\\nWell, so far we’ve had a good year. One of the things we invested in that, I believe was mentioned on last quarter’s call was the text messaging system that we had built, and that is so we have a better engagement with our customer base and we’re still operating with e-mails.\\nWe’re currently over 350,000 active text message customers and again, people on their cellphone are wanting the same anymore. So we’re seeing great returns on that, and we’re adding $10,000-plus per week. So that is still growing significantly. And some proof of that would have been the Labor Day sale that was the exact same sale we had in previous year, which is the big buy two get one free for our used product launch. And that sale on Labor Day was at 14% year-over-year same-store sales.\\nThe anniversary sale, the 1st week of November was over a 11% on same-store sales. And while our store sales will be slightly down, slightly up week-to-week, we’re getting these big pops and it is directly tied to that text messaging.\\nOne of the other things is, we were – Virland had mentioned about compressed margins a little bit, and a big part of that is the videogame cyclical nature. And we have huge sales in the PS4 even with some supply issues that is plugging the whole industry and all retailers on with Sony’s product. But that is starting to clear up. I think it’s a chip issue.\\nThe switch is very, very successful from Nintendo and is the number two seller and is very close to PS4 sales, and Xbox One is still Microsoft and Xbox really sales are good, but there is not much margin in those items. You sell them systems for $300. You make about $3 or $4 each. It’s about the long-term and it really hits the couple of years. Now we have a lot of used product that again, the margins are more in that 60% to 80% on used games and hardware.\\nSo we see a bright future. We like with the way that the direction is on the video game, which has been a little bit of a lag for us. But it looks like it’s going to be really good here in the next couple of years.\\nVirland Johnson\\nOne of the biggest milestones for Vintage this year was the refinance of a term loan that was expensive and that we replaced with Comvest. So that was really good for Vintage. We also have a few store openings on the horizon, Rodney, I think, in the next year what you think, maybe four, maybe more potentially for 2019?\\nRodney Spriggs\\nWe – which would not be a part of this reporting period, but we did open two locations: one in Columbia, Missouri and one in Tyler, Texas in November, so those are currently operating. It looks like they will be profitable from day one. Good lease prices on those and then sales came out the gate really strong.\\nAs per our agreement with Comvest, we can do three stores between now and September and then we can do four stores next year, but there is also the possibility that we could request to do additional stores if they keep performing like they are as we open up.\\n\\nJon Isaac\\nThe Comvest loan has helped us save significant amounts in interest expense. And in addition to that, we’ve been aggressively paying down that principal loan, I think, to the tune of about $3 million or so per year. They also have the cash suite. So this holiday period, there might be some there. Let’s take a question from JP.\\nUnidentified Analyst\\nHi, guys, how are you?\\nJon Isaac\\nGood. How are you, JP?\\nUnidentified Analyst\\nDoing well. First, couple of questions, I guess for Virland. One – and I haven’t been able to look at the 10-K. But last quarter, it looks like there’s – maybe a charge-off for write-down on the Vintage division. Is that right? Maybe just tune of about about $2 million. Is that correct, or is that product-specific, or walk me through that if you don’t mind?\\nVirland Johnson\\nI don’t think, we made any charge-offs in the Vintage division last quarter.\\nUnidentified Analyst\\nOkay. What were the financials on the Vintage division for the last quarter, compared to this, and then I guess?\\nVirland Johnson\\nWe don’t necessarily report that specifically in Q4. Vintage’s numbers are very comparable. The revenues are up year-over-year. Gross margin, as Rodney indicated earlier, is down a little bit, mainly because of the margin on new products and has slipped a little bit. But again, the business is very healthy and doing well. So I would look – I would may be having a look at our revenues by product line and gross profits by product line, and that will give you a real feel for how Vintage is doing.\\nUnidentified Analyst\\nOkay. And then on the ApplianceSmart acquisition, again, it may be in this 10-K. But can you walk us through the terms of that acquisition?\\nVirland Johnson\\nTerms were originally a note to Appliance Recycling Centers of America, Inc. It was a due to do from a amount and then it converted to a note. And then ApplianceSmart we paid or paid a little over $2.5 million on the principal between December 30 and Q3. And now that note is accruing interest and is currently not due for another couple of years.\\nUnidentified Analyst\\nOkay. What is the total balance on the note?\\nVirland Johnson\\nIt’s about $3.8 million.\\nUnidentified Analyst\\nOkay, all right, and thank you so much. And then my last question, I’ll hang up and thank you guys for taking my questions. The – I guess, the bargain basement for 2018 or for fiscal year, what – all the way were there two bargain basement that flow through the income statement, or what is the total amount of the bargain basement, I guess, upgrade, if you will, to the finance?\\nJon Isaac\\nIt was in two steps and then there was a brief adjustment in Q4 due to audit. But the total bargain purchased gain was $7.2 million.\\nUnidentified Analyst\\nOkay.\\nJon Isaac\\nAnd that only applied to ApplianceSmart, it didn’t apply to any other entity.\\nUnidentified Analyst\\nOkay. So it’s just the ApplianceSmart, and that were fully reflected in the EPS number?\\nVirland Johnson\\nYes.\\nUnidentified Analyst\\nOkay. All right. Thanks, guys.\\nVirland Johnson\\nWe also took one-time non-cash expenses such as the deferred tax asset revaluation. There was a couple of positive hits and negative hits.\\nUnidentified Analyst\\nYes.\\nJon Isaac\\nThank you for your questions.\\nUnidentified Analyst\\nSure. And what does those net outreach, Jon?\\nJon Isaac\\nWell, we took a $3 million hit on income taxes due to reval of the deferred tax assets. At the beginning of the year, if everybody remembers this, we had a fairly substantial deferred tax assets to the NOLs that have been carried over.\\nWhen cash – the Tax Act came into being in December, we have to reval those. And the total revaluation effect for the year is right at $3 million. That hit has fully baked into our EPS numbers in the P&L. Offsetting that, we had about $7.2 million of pickup on bargain purchase. But we also have a lot of expenses related to ApplianceSmart that we’ve had to absorb in making the transition into those numbers that are also fully baked in our P&L.\\n\\nSo we don’t really see once – we see the gain there, but it’s offset by some other things that are largely a wash for us. But since we’re on the topic of ApplianceSmart, I just want to mention something. I mean, the Marquis Industries is doing phenomenal. I think, it’s breaking records, sometimes months, sometimes every month. Vintage is doing really good.\\nThe growth prospects on Vintage looks good. ApplianceSmart is not doing so good, but we are in the middle of fixing some issues related to high cost, high-overhead and we may close some stores that are just not – that are contributing negatively to the bottom line. So, right now, we are devoting a lot of time and attention on an ApplianceSmart. But we think the turnaround will be good and no promises. But this is our main focus right now.\\nVirland Johnson\\nThe other thing, I think, shareholders should be aware of is that, the synthetic point from our key was the lowest margin-producing line that we had at Marquis. And by selling that line off, it’s going to even help Marquis numbers even more.\\nUnidentified Analyst\\nRight. Thanks, guys.\\nJon Isaac\\nThank you.\\nVirland Johnson\\nThank you.\\nOperator\\n[Operator Instructions]\\nJon Isaac\\nI think it’s important for shareholders to understand a synthetic turf sale that closed recently. So didn’t happen in the fiscal year, it happened. The subsequent event, we – that was disclosed in the 10-K, but that synthetic turf line was sold to some other company for about, what, 5.5 million.\\nVirland Johnson\\n$5.5 million?\\nJon Isaac\\n$5.5 million in cash, and that helped us payoff some term loans, but about half of that sale price went towards just cash and availability under our line of credit at Marquis. And then in addition to that, there was a consulting agreement that was signed between Marquis and the buyer of this equipment.\\nSo from a bottom line perspective, I think, it will be a neutral. But it does bring in some new cash that we can really redeploy. In the month of July, we also announced Mr. Wes Godfrey was appointed CEO at Marquis. We announced in February our new $10 million repurchase program that we’ve been excited about. Any other questions?\\nOperator\\nAnd it does look like we have any further questions on the phone line at this time.\\nUnidentified Analyst\\nMaybe, Jon, give investors some – your views for 2019?\\nJon Isaac\\nAs I mentioned, we’re very excited for 2019. We’re looking at the two potential prospects that I believe we may be able to – there’s a good chance that we may be able to make both acquisitions, both of them would be sort of a bolt-on for our existing platform companies.\\nSo we’re very excited about those. We’re focused on addressing the concerns of the ApplianceSmart and potentially two other acquisitions. But we also look at acquisitions on a weekly basis. They come across our desk and we get them from all sorts of places, investment bankers. We get them from private sellers, people who want to sell to us directly.\\nSo we look at those and we’re very careful as to who we proceed with and we have a certain criteria and we had here by it. So we may not have a year, where we have a lot of acquisitions, but some of the years it may offset. But our goal is usually one good acquisition, maybe two acquisitions per year, and we think it’s a long-term that Live will be a very healthy company as it is now and as shown historically, where we’ve taken the company in just the last few years.\\nOperator\\n[Operator Instructions]\\nJon Isaac\\nLet’s take the call from Alan [ph] – question from Alan.\\nUnidentified Analyst\\nHello. This is [indiscernible] actually. I was cut off and – for the first five minutes before the Q&A and missed your main presentation. Could you give me a 30-second summary of that first five minutes of your presentation?\\n\\nJon Isaac\\nYou missed the presentation. Yes, at a high-level, I’ll just coke the – maybe the bullet points from the press release. Our revenues were around $200 million. I’ll have Virland.\\nVirland Johnson\\nYes. Revenues are up about $200 million, 31.3%; our gross profits at $74.2 million, up 18.6%; our basic EPS is at $3.01; and our non-GAAP EBITDA is up to $25 million, up 7.8% year-over-year; assets are at $141.5 million. It was a growth year for us and we’re looking to grow into 2019. I will say the one thing that stands out the most is our operating cash flow that grew over 50% year-over-year. We’re almost at $12 million or something.\\nJon Isaac\\nYes. Okay. What else can we answer for you?\\nUnidentified Analyst\\nThat’s good. Thank you.\\nJon Isaac\\nAll right. Thank you. We’ll end the call if there’s no other questions get someone next 15 seconds to.\\nVirland Johnson\\nWe will be back to you in 45 days.\\nJon Isaac\\nYes, for the next for the…\\nVirland Johnson\\nFor the Q1 call.\\nJon Isaac\\n…first quarter. We do have another question from [San Thiago] [ph] San Thiago?\\nUnidentified Analyst\\nHello, Jon, can you hear me?\\nJon Isaac\\nYes, we can hear you.\\nUnidentified Analyst\\nYes. So my question was in regards to the liberation of the company, right? So my question was, have you considered increasing the share repurchases instead of acquisition?\\nJon Isaac\\nWe have been active in acquiring back shares whenever we can. Remember that the company just like us individually, we have blackout periods. And in addition to that, we cannot buy back stock if we’re in possession of material nonpublic information. So we strictly adhere to, of course, these rules. But when we are able to, we do buy on the open market. I believe the figure that I looked at recently in the 10-K yesterday was we acquired – we repurchased 142,000 since the start of the repurchase program. 142,000 shares, which represents approximately maybe 5% of the company just round figures.\\nSo yes, and now I believe we acquired stock at around – last year around $10 a share, now we’re at 30% less, despite the fact that we are stronger from a balance sheet perspective. Our cash flow has increased and we have a lot more on the horizon. So yes, we do look at Live Ventures and of itself as a potential acquisition in terms of buying incremental amounts of it back, and we had been successful in the past.\\nUnidentified Analyst\\nAll right. Thank you very much.\\nJon Isaac\\nOn that note actually, Virland, I get a lot of questions from investors who say, how come why the stock down, why the stock up? We really can’t comment on why the market behaves the way it does. I mean, if you look at the market as a whole three weeks ago was 30%, 40%, 50% more valuable. So it’s – the market as a whole has been down, but we take it a day at a time and we’re building the company for the long haul.\\nAnd whenever the opportunity presents itself and our stock is sold at a rate that we believe is good, we take advantage of it and we buy it back. So we’ve made it very, very clear to the investment community that we are and we will be buying shares in our company as we see fit and we’ve proven that. And I believe in 2019, we will be probably aggressively doing that. So we’ll see where we are a few months from now.\\nVirland Johnson\\nWell, thank you. We look forward to talking with you again in about 45 days to talk to Q1. Thank you for your participation on the call, those of you that asked questions and thank you for you – to the investors that are listening to the call. We’ll talk to you again soon.\\nJon Isaac\\nThank you.\\nVirland Johnson\\nThank you.\\nOperator\\nThis does conclude today’s program. Thank you for your participation. You may disconnect at any time.'}\n"

While rising interest rates is a positive factor for banks, interest rates going too high is not. The market is currently concerned that the Fed may end up tightening too far, which could cause a recession over the long-term. As a result, while short-term rates are rising, long-term rates are declining as the market lowers its interest rate expectations for the future. Consequently, the yield curve has flattened, which usually signals weaker economic conditions ahead. Amid fears of a yield curve inversion, there is debate over whether this remains a reliable recession indicator. This article assesses the implications of an inverting yield curve for the financial sector and the broader economy. \\n\\nSource: Yahoo Finance Prospectus Review: According to the Fund’s prospectus, the VFH ETF seeks to track the performance of the ‘Spliced US IMI Financials 25/50’ index using an indexing investment strategy. The fund is not concentrated in only large-cap stocks, but also holds exposure to mid-cap and small-cap stocks from the financial sector. The ETF has an annual net expense ratio of 0.10%, which is notably lower than the 0.38% average of all ETFs that offer exposure to the financial sector. The top holdings of the ETF include: \\n\\n\\n Risk Note: Note that while the fund management aims to track the underlying index as closely as possible, tracking errors could occur. For instance, if the proportionate weighting of a particular stock changes in the underlying index, the fund will have to buy/sell stocks accordingly, which could incur time delays and additional transaction expenses. The chart below indicates the tracking differences between the ETF price and the underlying index: \\n\\nSource: Vanguard Among ETFs that offer exposure to the financial sector, this ETF has one of the highest Assets Under Management (AUM), currently standing at around $6.09 million, according to data from ETFdb.com. I consider AUM as a good indicator for how successful the fund has been in implementing its strategy to deliver on its objectives for investors. The higher its AUM, the more investors have allocated their capital towards the fund due to effective management. Moreover, it also has one of the highest average daily trading volumes, currently at 1.04 million. Hence this means that the ETF has a relatively healthy level of liquidity. This is a good indicator for how easily investors can buy and sell shares in the ETF. Therefore, the higher the trading volume, the lower the liquidity risks. Flattening yield curve Banks borrow from the short-end of the yield curve and make loans at the longer end. The spread between the short-term and long-term rates is how they predominantly generate their earnings. However, the flattening yield curve this year has dampened investor sentiment towards the sector amid anticipation that banks’ earnings will suffer in the future. Moreover, amid fears of the yield curve inverting (10yr yield falling below the 2yr yield), investors are concerned that this will signal an upcoming recession. Since 1955, all nine recessions were preceded by an inverted yield curve. The reasoning behind this is that if the long-term rates fall below the short-term rate, banks have little to no incentive to lend out money, as those loans would be unprofitable for banks. Hence if banks reduce lending activity, this would tighten credit conditions and make it more difficult for businesses to raise debt capital. This in turn leads to lower capital expenditure and employment, which will be followed by lower consumer spending, whereby we would enter a weakening economic cycle which would result in a recession at some point after the yield curve has inverted. Therefore, once the yield curve inverts it is certainly not a good idea to hold onto the VFH ETF, as the financial sector will be one of the first sectors to reflect signs of weakening when a recession is on the horizon.\\n Contrary View However, there are market participants with a contrary view towards the implications of a yield curve inversion. They argue that while the yield curve inversion may have correctly forecasted previous recessions, this indicator is no longer valid following the financial crisis, as the ultra-loose monetary policy conditions adopted by the Fed, including Quantitative Easing (QE), have changed the dynamics of the credit markets. Moreover, QE has artificially suppressed long-term yields lower, which allows the yield curve to flatten and invert more easily. Nevertheless, I do not agree with this notion, because the Fed’s ultra-loose monetary policy actions following the crisis have lowered yields across the spectrum, and simply shifted the entire yield curve lower in comparison to historical levels. The banks’ business model has not changed dramatically. These financial institutions still borrow at short-term rates, and lend out at long-term rates. Hence the inversion of the yield curve still negatively affects bank profitability, regardless of the level at which the inversion occurs. Furthermore, while the Fed’s QE actions aimed to lower yields, the central bank is actually currently in the process of unwinding its balance sheet that it had built up during the recovery. Given that the weighted average maturity of the Fed’s Treasury holdings is 8 years, the Fed’s unwinding process should lead to this section of the yield curve to rise. The Fed began shrinking its balance sheet in October 2017, and since then the benchmark 10yr yield has surged from around 2% to over 3.20% in November 2018 (note that changes in the fed funds rate also influences the 10yr yield). However since November, the 10yr has actually declined back down to 2.75%, even amid the Fed persistently moving ahead with unwinding the balance sheet. This drop amid Fed tightening reflects the fact that significantly weaker economic conditions are expected over the long-term. Therefore, an inversion of the yield curve where the 10yr yield falls below the 2yr yield should still be considered a reliable indicator of a recession, or at the very least, gloomy economic conditions ahead. In either case, banks’ earnings will be hurt; hence investor sentiment towards the VFH ETF could remain weak.\\n Bottom Line The Fed may indeed end up hiking rates too far, to the point where the yield curve inverts. This will certainly hurt banks’ ability to generate earnings and profits, and could discourage them from making loans altogether if it is no longer profitable for them to borrow money at the short end of the yield curve and lend money at the longer end. I believe credit conditions will undoubtedly tighten next year, which will be reflected by a weaker financial sector and economy. Therefore, even though the VFH ETF has declined by about 17% this year, I do not recommend buying into the ETF until the shape of the yield curve turns more favorable for the financial sector.\\nDisclosure: I/we have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

Most of the market classic dividend stocks have fallen by the wayside, and share prices for AT&T (T) have dropped by 29.26% in the last year. Rising debt levels have led many analysts to question the viability of AT&T’s supreme dividend yield. These criticisms are not entirely unreasonable, given that the company’s debt levels continue to hover near the $180 million mark. But with an annualized dividend of $2.04 per share, AT&T’s payout ratio of 58% suggests a good measure of safety for long-term investors that are still holding the stock. AT&T generates strong levels of free cash flow, and the stock has become excessively cheap relative to its competition (based on forward-earnings valuations). As a result, investors focused on income generation should continue to look for opportunities to buy the stock in the weeks ahead. \\n\\n (Source: YCharts) Recent declines in AT&T’s share prices have certainly put the stock in precarious territory. But those declines have made the company’s valuations highly attractive for long-term investors. On a forward price-to-earnings basis, AT&T is currently trading at a 32.49% discount relative to key industry competitor Verizon Communications (VZ). These diverging trends in relative valuation began in April, and they have reached extremes now that we are coming to a close in 2018. In this case, a simple reversion to the mean would be greately beneficial for those holding T (when compared to those holding long positios in VZ).\\n \\n\\n (Source: Bloomberg) Of course, AT&T cannot claim to reign supreme in all relevant areas. After the company’s acquisitions of Time Warner and DIRECTV and Time Warner, debt levels have expanded in ways that can only be described as problematic. Roughly $50 million of AT&T’s current debt load will become due in the next five years, so this is a story which will not be going away any time soon. We must remember that these debt payments will become due as interest rate levels are rising, so there are strong elements of medium-term uncertainty which are tied to these issues. At the same time, we should note that Verizon’s debt levels come to roughly $112 billion. So it is not as if AT&T is unique in the obstacles which will be visible during these periods. \\n\\n (Source: Bloomberg) Investors focused on income generation will need to watch AT&T’s free cash flow figures, as this is a critical component in determining the company’s ability to maintain its high dividend payouts. On the basis of free cash flow, AT&T is currently trading at a discount of 38.83% when compared to Verizon. AT&T’s free cash flow figures are substantially above the figures generated by Verizon, and this will allow AT&T to maintain a solid margin of safety in its dividend offerings. As a point of comparison, Verizon’s dividend yield currently stands at 4.48%. This is well above the 1.30% average dividend yield seen throughout the technology sector but still far below the 7.42% dividend yield captured by those holding positions in T.\\n \\n\\n (Source: Author) All of that said, the chart outlook for AT&T looks very dismal after falling through triple-bottom support levels near $31.80 per share. The bearish momentum has been significant, and this has made it difficult for new investors attempting to identify a suitable point of entry. These sharp declines have been accompanied by rising trading volumes, so these events should not be dismissed as merely temporary in nature. Long-term support for the stock does not emerge again until we reach the lower $20s, and the strength of the bearish momentum suggests that investors will probably find continued opportunities over the next few weeks to buy the stock at lower levels. \\n\\n (Source: Zacks) Ultimately, there is still a sizable possibility that this activity will continue until the next earnings catalyst enters the market. AT&T is scheduled to report earnings on 01/30/2019, with the analyst consensus indicating a quarterly EPS performance of $0.85. If realized, this would mark an EPS gain of 8.97% relative to the same period last year. Over the last four quarters, AT&T has beaten market expectations on only two occasions (with an average upside surprise of 5.38% for the entire period). This places the current earnings estimates outside of the company’s annual averages, and this could make it more difficult for AT&T to deliver an upside surprise in earnings at the end of January. As a result, the stock should be viewed as a hold (rather than a buy) at current levels, as investors looking for a chance to develop exposure to this heavy dividend-payer may see better price level opportunities in the weeks ahead. \\n Thank you for reading. Now, it's time to make your voice heard. Reader interaction is the most important part of the investment learning process! Comments are highly encouraged. We look forward to reading your viewpoints on AT&T.\\nDisclosure: I am/we are long T. I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions.

      "{'article_name': 'Tencent Can Leverage WeChat In Auto Sector', 'time': None, 'symbol': None, 'class': None, 'company_name': None, 'bus_desc': None, 'summary': 'Strategic investments by Tencent in EV sector are growing rapidly.\"WeChat\" to be the platform for autonomous vehicles and related \"Internet of Vehicles\" solutions.The company is making investments at every level of the fast-growing EV market.', 'article': 'Tencent (OTCPK:OTCPK:TCEHY) is well-known to have investments in many areas. Its WeChat platform has over 1 billion users and has 34% of China\\'s mobile data traffic. I detailed this in a previous article. The company\\'s main revenue streams emanate from this platform. Gaming is the largest, representing about a third of revenue. Music, online advertising, Cloud connections, payments through Tenpay and increasingly fintech all feed off the Internet platform. As I detailed here, the music division has 800 million users based around the company\\'s Internet platforms. Tencent has a new focus on business services on the Cloud. The company\\'s growing investments in the auto sector show a new strategic direction for Tencent. This is specifically in regard to EVs and what is termed the Internet of Vehicles. It is based around developments the company is making in AI. As with its other major revenue drivers, this will be based around its WeChat platform. Tencent Strategy The company has been quietly building up its presence in the auto sector. Its investments have been both in major auto manufacturers and in related auto service companies. Tencent can have a strong strategic role to play as EVs replace ICE vehicles. This ties in with the company\\'s revised strategic plan earlier this year. At that time it declared it would focus more on business services on the Internet as opposed to consumer services. In this regard, it is coming up head-on with its rival Alibaba (NASDAQ:BABA), which has a lead in the area. The magnitude of the Internet in China and how it dwarfs the USA is illustrated below: \\n\\n\\n (Source: South China Morning Post) As I\\'ve written previously, Tencent is a complex company with many irons in the fire. Some think its investments have had somewhat of a scattergun approach. The new focus on business to business seems sensible though, given the government\\'s restrictions this year on gaming. Tencent is the world\\'s largest gaming company but may have become over-reliant on that sector for revenue. The change in the company\\'s strategic plan ties in with encouragement from the government. Beijing has named Tencent as one of four companies to spearhead technology in the country, especially as it relates to AI. Self-driving cars and smart cities are part of the plan. Facial recognition is playing a large role in this. Tencent has its Computer Vision Research Centre focusing on facial recognition. China is behind the USA in AI development. It is catching up, though. In particular, this relates to specific solutions within China. The government is also building up the country\\'s semiconductor industry specifically as it relates to chips for self-driving cars. In September, Tencent launched its open platform for AI. This is accessed thorough subsidiary Tencent Cloud. The company\\'s cloud revenues are reported to have doubled in the last quarter. They are still small compared to Alibaba, in particular. Though, they are expected to see rapid growth in coming quarters. The latest Q3 2018 results from Tencent indicate the company will continue to have plenty of resources to continue its investment strategy. In that period, revenues rose 24% to US$11.7 billion and profit increased 30% to US$3.4 billion. This was despite the slowdown in gaming in China. The debt situation is very manageable: Quick Ratio = 1.17 Current ratio = 1.18 Total debt-to-equity = 0.52 The Value to Tencent The potential value of Tencent\\'s auto investments is difficult to gauge at present. However, a look at Google\\'s Waymo subsidiary gives some indication of the possible value added for Tencent. Morgan Stanley recently came out with a valuation for Waymo of US$175 billion. This is based on the value of its autonomous robotaxi business and logistics delivery business. There is additionally a small element for licensing value to other companies.\\n The Morgan Stanley valuation is higher than that of other analysts. It does, however, show the potentially huge business opportunities that companies like Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Tencent are pursuing. Specifically in China, the market for autonomous vehicles will increase much more rapidly than elsewhere in the world. Tencent has developed its own autonomous concept car and operating system. The company is looking at the value of monetising the journey customers take through its WeChat platform. A report earlier this year by McKinsey emphasised the trend. It forecast autonomous vehicles in China would comprise 13% of all sales by 2030, and 66% by 2040. That would equate to 8 million autonomous cars by 2030 and 13 million by 2040. The sales values would amount to US$230 billion and US$360 billion respectively. The value of chips used in such autonomous vehicles in China is expected to reach US$5 billion by 2021. The long-term revenue potential for Tencent is obvious. It explains the company\\'s determined quest to invest in as many parts of the new world of EVs as possible. EVs in China China is the world\\'s largest auto market. In 2017, there were 24.72 million passenger and commercial vehicle sales in the country. There are 210 million private cars on the road. The trend of EVs replacing ICE vehicles is gaining pace in China. The official target from the government is that all vehicles on Chinese roads should be electrified by 2050. That day may seem a long way ahead. However, the pace of change to get there would need to be rapid with huge commercial revenues to be fought over annually. The Chinese government classifies NEVs (new electric vehicles) as comprising three types. There are PHEVs (plug-in hybrids), BEVs (pure battery electronic) and a smaller category of fuel cell vehicles. Incentives vary across the types. In the first eleven months of the year, PHEVs rose to 3.3% market share. This compares to 2.1% market share in 2017. Total EV sales this year are expected to exceed 1 million vehicles. This would represent about a 100% annual increase. The government has a target for the sale of 2 million EVs in 2020. By 2025, it wants annual EV sales to total 7 million. That would represent about 20% of total auto sales. Already, the China EV market is larger than the USA and Europe combined, and growing more rapidly.\\n The Economist Intelligence Unit (subscription required) had forecast EV sales worldwide would total 1.5 million in 2018. Over 60% of these sales will be in China. They predict sales of 2.2 million in 2019. That would be out of a total of new car sales worldwide of about 69 million. The Ministry of Industry and Information Technology has stated that the market for \"smart network vehicles\" alone will be worth 100 billion yuan (US$15.9 billion) as early as 2020. The drive from the authorities is not limited just to autos. E-buses are a huge growth market, led by Yutong and by BYD Auto (OTCPK:BYDDF). E-trucks are also growing rapidly. The pace of the change from ICE to EVs can be argued. What cannot be disputed is that it is happening. This brings up the question of how EVs will change the way we travel. Car usage will trump car ownership. Freight delivery by autonomous vehicles will be a huge market. This is where Tencent stands to be in a strategically commanding position. Tencent has been leading research in China into AI for the auto sector. The likely trend of calling up autonomous cars on one\\'s mobile would fit perfectly into the company\\'s WeChat platform. It would be an obvious extension of the widespread hailing of taxis on the WeChat platform. Payment by Tenpay would be seamless. This drive from Tencent is not just China-based. The WeChat platform is expanding elsewhere in Asia as well. The move towards EVs in the rest of Asia is building up steam. For instance, Singapore has a trial programme for users to call up buses on their mobile phones. Already as things stand, these could, in theory, be called up in Singapore on the WeChat platform and paid for by Tenpay. Alternatively, one could call up a taxi on Indonesian taxi firm Go-Jek, in which Tencent has a substantial investment. There are a lot of strands pulling together throughout Asia. There is a very strong network of companies involved in the EV industry in China with whom Tencent now has investments or co-operation deals. I focus on some of these below.\\n Tencent and Tesla TenCent has a 5% stake in Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) bought at a cost of US$1.8 billion. I detailed the possible ramifications of this in an article in 2017. Elon Musk then referred to Tencent as an \"investor and adviser\". Tesla\\'s China subsidiary has registered capital of 4.67 billion yuan (US$681 million). The factory in China is costing about US$2 billion to construct, according to Elon Musk. Some analysts have predicted it will cost US$5 billion in the long run. In the first instance, it is slated to produce 500,0000 vehicles per annum. Later investments, though, will include substantial battery manufacturing. It is not known how exactly Tesla is financing this or whether Tencent will make a further investment in the company. Tesla\\'s finance requirements are currently closely tied up to Model 3 production. It would not be surprising to see a further investment from Tencent as the Shanghai factory comes up. Autonomous vehicles will be a growing investment opportunity for Tesla. There is a potentially great fit with Tencent. Another opportunity for the two companies lies in online auto sales. Tesla famously has eschewed the dealer network model common to the auto industry. Tencent has investments in online auto sales. Tencent and Didi Chuxing Tencent has a stake in Didi Chuxing (DIDI), the company that took over the business of Uber (UBER) in China. The 2014 investment is thought to have been about US$100 million. Apple (AAPL) also has a substantial stake. In many ways, Apple seems to be pursuing a similar path towards autonomous vehicles as Tencent. It seems to be less far down the road compared to Tencent though. Those on the WeChat platform can currently access Didi\\'s services. Didi is looking to set up EV car sharing services with 12 leading auto manufacturers in China. Tencent\\'s tie-up with Didi Chuxing is expanding around Asia. One can view it as part of the struggle with Alibaba, which itself is teamed up with Uber. Tencent and NIO NIO (NYSE:NIO) had a high-profile IPO in the USA in September. Tencent\\'s stake represented 15.2% of the company and 21.5% of the voting rights. NIO\\'s chairman, William Li, has 17.2% of the voting rights. So, Tencent and Lio together have a strong hold on the company.\\n Other key partners of NIO comprise Mobileye (INTC), Baidu (NASDAQ:BIDU) and China\\'s largest battery manufacturer, CATL. This looks like a strong grouping to try to grab pole position in China\\'s high-end EV market. NIO\\'s ES8 sports utility vehicle began deliveries in June. Its ES6 SUV should be debuting in the first half of 2019. Tencent\\'s stake gives it further access to NIO\\'s upcoming stream of EVs and its special emphasis on autonomous driving. NIO is very much looking at the upmarket part of EV demand. It could be seen as a direct competitor to Tesla in the Chinese market. It will probably need a large re-financing package in 2019. It will be interesting to see what role Tencent plays in that. Will Tencent be a major backer of both NIO and Tesla? That is a big question which may be answered quite soon. Tencent and Here HERE is a company concentrating on mapping data and location services. It grew out of the Nokia Maps business. With Tencent, it will be focusing on maps outside China. These can be channelled through the company\\'s WeChat and QQ platforms. This illustrates the international ambitions of Tencent as with its strategic investment in Indonesia\\'s ride-hailing company Go-Jek. Apart from Tencent, other investors in HERE include BMW (OTCPK:BMWYY), Audi (OTCPK:AUDVF) and Daimler (OTCPK:DDAIF). Tencent and FAW Group In April this year, Tencent signed an agreement with the FAW Group. It is the old, state-controlled manufacturer of the \"Red Flag\" brand in China. The agreement was said to be to develop autonomous driving with a particular emphasis on Internet of Vehicles security solutions. They will develop auto-driving solutions together and work on actual auto models for mass production. In October, the FAW Group received a startling US$145 billion credit line from the central government. This was said to be to \"develop auto-driving solutions\". The announcement of the April agreement was made by FAW Group on its Tencent site. Tencent and Changan Auto Also in April this year, Tencent signed an agreement with state-owned Chongqing Changan Auto Co. Tencent will have a 51% stake in the joint venture company, which will be developing an open platform to provide solutions for smart and connected autos. This seems to be a similar plan to the Apollo Project instituted by Baidu. That company already has an agreement with Changan. The agreement between Changan and Tencent has particular emphasis on developing an Internet of Vehicles platform. This will include data analysis of facial recognition and driver drowsiness detection.\\n Tencent and Guangzhou Automobile In 2017, Tencent made its first major move into the EV market when it teamed up with GAC. At the time, the stated aim was to develop smart cars which would be connected on the Internet and aided by AI. The two companies are pushing the concept of \"mobility as a service\", under the acronym \"MaaS\". This uses Tencent\\'s operating system. Tencent has developed the \"iSpace\" concept car using its \"AI in Car\" operating system. This is illustrated below: \\n\\n (Source: Autocar UK) The AI in Car system can recognise users when they enter the vehicle and customise their journey experience. This then opens up the possibilities of further monetising the driving experience. E-commerce for autos and speech solutions were also said to be areas of collaboration, as is insurance. Tencent\\'s main contribution in this regard will be by using its Cloud services and related technical support. Tencent and Bitauto Bitauto (BITA) is a company primarily involved in financing of the auto industry, in which Tencent has an investment. It is looking to be the largest online car finance platform. In another example of the interweaving between players in this industry in China, its chairman, William Li, is also chairman of NIO. Tencent and Renrenche Renrenche is a company selling used cars on peer-to-peer platforms. Tencent and Didi Chuxing are its top two institutional shareholders. Didi works very closely with Renrenche and plans to buy large numbers of used cars on the platform. Tencent and Future Mobility Corp. Future Mobility is specifically targeting the manufacture of luxury EVs. Its target was to have autonomous EVs on the road by 2020. That seems overambitious. In fact, all has been somewhat quiet about the progress this company is making. It is not certain how far the cooperation with Tencent has developed. It may well be that Tencent will focus more on NIO for the upmarket sector of the market.\\n Tencent and Harmony Futeng Harmony also has a stake in Future Mobility Corp. Harmony itself wants to launch smart EVs on Tencent\\'s Internet platforms. In 2017, it invested US$195 million in a 300,000 capacity plant. As with Future Mobility, there has been a lack of firm news on development plans recently. Tencent and Lyft Tencent has a co-operation agreement with California-based Lyft (NASDAQ:LYFT). Lyft is mainly involved in ride-sharing developments. It has a lot of trials on the road in the USA. Tencent has itself set up its own autonomous driving research team in California. The company has stated that this is focusing on various autonomous areas. These include perception and sensor fusion, motion planning and control, behaviour prediction, and machine learning. California is, of course, the home base of Google. Its Waymo technology is generally considered to be the most advanced on the market. Tencent and Tuhu China-based car maintenance startup Tuhu recently raised US$450 million in a fund raising exercise. The company is involved in after-sales service and supply, including ordering online through a mobile app. That may be where Tencent\\'s strengths can contribute. Conclusion Gaming and fintech should be strong drivers for revenue growth for Tencent in 2019. These are at the centre of much of the company\\'s investments, as I detailed here. In Q3, the sector defined as \"mobile payments and cloud services\" grew 69%. Much of the future growth is likely to come from this. Looking long term, the EV market based around the strengths of the company\\'s Internet presence could be a huge revenue earner. The Internet of Vehicles will be an important focus. WeChat will be the main platform, and the company\\'s AI developments the main driver. Tencent and its partners are looking to monetise the journey itself. It is a high-stakes game in which Tencent appears to have the will and the finance to last the course. The promise of this looks like a good bet for those who understand the transformation of the Chinese auto industry from ICE vehicles to EVs.\\n\\nDisclosure: I am/we are long TCEHY AAPL TSLA BYDDF.

      "{'article_name': 'Flotek Fights Hard To Stay Above The Water', 'time': None, 'symbol': None, 'class': None, 'company_name': None, 'bus_desc': None, 'summary': \"A shift in clients' purchase behavior has led to near-term operational challenges for Flotek.The current weakness in crude oil price has kept its stock price low.Flotek is finding diversified use for its premier CnF chemistries.The company’s cash flow from operations was negative in the first nine months of FY2018.\", 'article': \"Flotek’s challenges and response Flotek Industries (FTK) provides chemistry and services that are used in the oil and gas industries and the consumer and industrial markets. The company’s clients are focusing more on sourcing chemistry products directly from manufacturers and providers of these products. This trend has thrown an operational and structural challenge to Flotek. In response, the company looks to diversify into the non-thermal manufacturing, including the nutraceutical, pharmaceutical and agriculture sectors. Increased share of value-added product sales, including CnF, should improve the company’s margin. I expect Flotek’s revenue growth to slow down in the near term. However, the stock should see a steady recovery in the medium to long term. In 2018 so far, FTK stock price has dipped by 75%, while the VanEck Vectors Oil Services ETF (OIH) declined by 46%. OIH represents the oilfield equipment & services (or OFS) industry. \\n\\n What are Flotek’s current drivers? From Q3 2017 to Q3 2018, Flotek Industries’ Energy Chemistry Technologies (or ECT) segment revenues decreased by 12%. The ECT segment, which provides specialty chemistries used in well drilling, cementing, completion and stimulation activities, saw a higher share of low-margin products and a reduction in orders from certain key customers. The primary reason for the headwind turned out to be a shift in purchasing behaviors by Flotek’s E&P customers. Upstream companies are focusing more on sourcing consumables, including chemistry, directly from manufacturers. This has become Flotek’s key operational challenge.\\n In Flotek’s Consumer and Industrial Technologies (or CICT) segment, revenues decreased by 6% year over year. Despite that, the segment’s EBITDA margin improved from 3.3% to 5.0% due to reduced direct costs and a better product mix. Through the CICT segment, the company designs, develops and manufactures products for the flavor and fragrance industry and the specialty chemical industry. What’s working for Flotek? On a quarter-over-quarter basis, the ECT segment revenues improved by 36% in Q3 2018. There has been increasing demand for Flotek’s Complex nano-Fluid, known as CnF, driven by unconventional drilling activity in the Middle East by the nationalized oil companies. During Q3, the Middle East surpassed Canada to become Flotek’s largest international geographic market. In the U.S., the ECT sales are primarily built through the full-fluids Prescriptive Chemistry Management (or PCM) platform. This is evidenced by the fact that 75% of the company’s clients use value-added chemistry as part of their fluid systems delivered through PCM after Q3, compared to only 50% by the end of FY2017. In the CICT business, Flotek is expanding into new citrus opportunities by investing in the extraction capabilities. This strategy is in line with its target to seek higher-margin sales opportunities in the flavor and fragrance business. Flotek’s cost reduction target \\n\\n In Q3 2018, Flotek’s quarterly cash SG&A decreased by 5% over Q2. Compared to Q4 2016, this was a 36% reduction. The company aims for further cost-cutting in the areas of salaries and benefits, travel and entertainment and variable incentives. As a result, management targets to bring cash SG&A levels down to 15% of revenues into 2019.\\n What are the industry challenges for specialty chemicals? In the past three years, the upstream operators have resorted to advanced fracking techniques and increased lateral length in their well completions designs to benefit from crude oil price dynamics. The other key challenge for the operators is to maintain capital efficiency in their infill development program in the child and parent wells. Increased level of capital is being used to address the down spacing concerns and unit production underperformance in the parent-child type of production. Flotek’s fluid design treatments have applications starting from the initial frac through the full lifecycle of the well. The company’s advanced chemistry products are targeted to mitigate the adverse effects of frac hits and underperforming wells. Is Flotek adding value to customers? \\n\\n Flotek’s products help reduce overall chemistry spend per well, optimize horsepower efficiency and reduce fluid reservoir incompatibility. According to company management's estimates, this saves its clients $1.9 million per month, which translates to more than $20 million in cost benefit per year. On top of that, the use of Flotek’s fluid leads to lower horsepower requirement, which leads to less overall wear and tear on their fluid ends. The company conducted a study in the Eagle Ford in 100 wells over two years. The study found that wells with Flotek-prescribed chemistry outperformed the proppant normalized production rates of non-treated wells. Wells using PCM technologies produced incremental 33,000 barrels of oil equivalent over the first year. In the CICT segment, the company looks to expand into non-thermal manufacturing. For example, the nutraceutical, pharmaceutical and agriculture sectors can present growth opportunities for Flotek. The use of D-limonene in the CnF technology can help the company break through into unchartered territory. D-limonene is considered to have low toxicity compared to the limonene chemical found in citrus fruit. Flotek sources citrus oil, which is used as an additive by companies in the flavors and fragrances markets and also has uses in the upstream energy companies.\\n Management guidance \\n\\n In Q4, the negative drivers for Flotek would be the upstream budget exhaustion as the year comes to the close and weather-related energy production disruption. The primary concern for the company is the change in clients' preferred choice of vendors and fluctuations in large orders from its international geographies. On the positive side, Flotek’s domestic sales in the ECT segment in October improved after some of its clients made the transition to the direct-to-operator PCM market channel. Management expects the CICT segment revenue to increase by a mid-single digit, while its EBITDA is also likely to improve. These stem from the company's expansion in Asia and the development of flavor application technologies. Flotek has negative cash flows In the first three quarters of FY2018, the company’s cash from operations outflow was ~$24 million. In 9M 2018, its cash flow deteriorated compared to the prior year. The cash flow decline reflects higher inventory level related to greater purchases of citrus oils from South America for FY 2019 and underperformance of internal consumption in the ECT segment. Its capex was not significant in the first nine months of FY2018. Flotek’s cash and cash equivalents were $1.8 million. As of September 30, 2018, the company had $15.2 million available under the revolving credit facility. As of September 30, 2018, Flotek Industries classified $53 million borrowings under revolving credit facility as current debt “as a result of the required lockbox arrangement and the subjective acceleration clause.” Despite no immediate repayment requirement, with negative cash flow from operations and a slender cash balance, its balance sheet can be exposed to potential financial risks.\\n What does Flotek’s relative valuation say? \\n\\n Flotek Industries’ EV-to-adjusted EBITDA multiple is not meaningful as a result of negative adjusted EBITDA in the past twelve months. According to sell-side analysts’ estimates pulled from Thomson Reuters, the company’s forward EV/EBITDA multiple is positive, which indicates analysts’ estimates of a positive EBITDA in the next four quarters. From FY2012 to FY2017, Flotek’s average EV/EBITDA multiple was 48.4x. So, its forward multiple is at a discount to the past six-year average. Also, the average forward EV/EBITDA multiple compression of Flotek’s industry peers versus their current multiple suggests an improvement in EBITDA over the next four quarters. The company’s forward EV/EBITDA multiple is higher than its peers’ (National Oilwell Varco (NOV), CARBO Ceramics (CRR) and Halliburton Company (HAL)) average of 9.6x. Analysts’ rating on Flotek \\n\\n According to data provided by Seeking Alpha, one sell-side analyst rated FTK a “Buy” in December, while one recommended a “Hold.” The analysts’ consensus target price for the stock is $3.0, which at its current price yields ~154% returns. A high percentage of institutional holding \\n\\n\\n Approximately, 74% of Flotek’s shares outstanding are held by insiders. According to data taken from Thomson Reuters, BlackRock and Vanguard are the top two institutional holders. Wilks Brothers also owns 4.7% of the company. Stock price volatility FTK is currently trading at $1.18. The stock price can fluctuate widely in response to various economic and non-economic factors. The stock price volatility has increased significantly in the past three months. Its one-month volatility has increased from the ~79% level by the end of September to ~99% now. This makes investing in this stock risky. What’s the take on Flotek? Flotek is having a difficult time readjusting to consumer preference in the energy chemistry technology industry. Its clients are focusing more on sourcing chemistry products directly from manufacturers and providers of these products. This trend has created significant changes in the company’s customer base, product portfolio and sales efforts. In addition to energy, Flotek looks to expand into non-thermal manufacturing, including the nutraceutical, pharmaceutical and agriculture sectors. ECT’s true values will unlock when its acceptance increases as E&P operators seek to enhance their well economics through chemistry technology. Flotek’s cash flow from operations has been negative in the past three quarters, which does raise some concerns. The current energy price downturn and completions activity slowdown will also have an adverse effect on Flotek’s revenues and earnings in the near term. However, the company’s long-term drivers have not changed. Increased share of value-added product sales, including CnF, should improve its margin. As the industry headwinds recede, I expect Flotek to grow steadily in the medium to long term.\\nDisclosure: I/we have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

It is truly a great buy that can easily give investors more than a 100% return. Introduction GE is a huge conglomerate with over a century of history that operates in several major industries, including energy, transportation, healthcare, financial services and aviation. Warren Buffett Likely to Move to Buy GE Famed investor Warren Buffett is known for looking for undervalued investments that present a compelling long-term advantage, and he is interested in companies that are selling at an undervalued discount relative to its fundamentals. Also, he looks for companies with a wide moat and great management but that are mispriced due to some temporary events. With Buffett at the tail end of his career, there is no better opportunity currently than General Electric. He has invested in the company in the past, and it has a long-storied history as one of the most successful companies of the last 100 years. So, it’s a company that Buffett would invest in, to make a big splash at the end of his long, storied career. Segment Analysis   GE Power             2017 2016 2015     Revenue 36 36.8 28.9 billion   Profit Margin 7.8% 13.9% 16.6%     Backlog 98     billion   GE Power is the company’s largest division. It manufactures gas and steam turbines, engines, generators, and high-voltage equipment and provides power-generation services and digital solutions. GE Power’s revenue grew from 2015 to 2017 because of demand for power generation equipment, but its profit margin dropped during this period because of overcapacity driving down pricing/margins as well as lower demand for service upgrades. GE management is planning to keep GE Power even though it is spinning off several other divisions. The division's backlog showed modest growth of only 3%, which caused worry among management because of the softening growth in power demand. The growth expected from traditional power is now going to renewables.\\n   Renewable Energy           2017 2016 2015     Revenue 10.3 9 6.3 billion   Profit Margin 6.8% 6.7% 6.3%     Backlog 15     billion   GE Renewable Energy is a manufacturer of onshore and offshore wind turbines, wind turbine blades, and hydropower solutions. Its revenues and profit margin increased from 2015 to 2017 because of strong revenue and orders growth, new product introductions, and new digital capacity. GE Renewable also saw a 15% increase in backlog due to increases in overall renewable energy demand worldwide. Its backlog was boosted by it securing orders from the largest wind farm in the US - the 2 GW wind catcher farm in Oklahoma - and the largest wind farm in Australia - the 453 MW Coopers Gap Wind Farm in North Queensland. GE needs to invest heavily in this segment to boost orders because this is the company’s future. GE Renewable Energy has the potential to become the largest division of GE in the next 10 years. This strongly supports the investment thesis and is also a good sign for Warren Buffett.   Oil and Gas             2017 2016 2015     Revenue 17.2 12.9 16.5 billion   Profit Margin 1.2% 10.9% 14.5%     Backlog 21     billion   GE Oil and Gas provides oilfield services, oilfield equipment, turbomachinery, process solutions, and digital solutions. The oil and gas segment comprises 62.5% of Baker Hughes GE (NYSE: BHGE) following the combination of GE Oil and Gas with Baker Hughes in July 2017. GE Oil and Gas’s revenues increased from 2015 to 2017 because of increased business in oilfield services and digital solutions for oil and gas with GE’s purchase of Baker Hughes, but the post-merger integration and clash of cultures resulted in a crash in profit margin, and GE is looking to sell off or spin off the Oil and Gas division, as it is no longer compatible with the company’s long-term goals. This is also a value-creation opportunity for investors that agrees with the investment thesis: in the event of a spinoff, shareholders who buy GE stock will get shares from the spinoff of BHGE. Backlog growth remained flat in 2017 primarily because of the soft price of crude oil.\\n   Aviation             2017 2016 2015     Revenue 27.4 26.3 24.7 billion   Profit Margin 24.1% 23.2% 22.3%     Backlog 170     billion   GE Aviation manufactures commercial and military engines, aviation systems, and additive manufacturing machines. GE should look at merging this division with a slimmed down United Technologies (UTX) without Carrier and Otis. This will be a great merger that will yield a world-class Western player to take on the competition in aviation to come from China. GE Aviation can easily be merged with Pratt & Whitney, a division of United Technologies, and huge cost synergies be realized by eliminating overlaps. GE Aviation’s revenues and profit margin increased from 2015 to 2017 because of growth in commercial and military services offsetting margin pressure from the ramp-up of the LEAP engines. The LEAP backlog also drove the 10% increase in the $170 billion backlog. GE can basically merge this division with United Technologies and keep United Technologies a publicly traded company, with GE and minority shareholders owning the company. This will create an aviation powerhouse that the world has never seen, with pieces including United Technologies’ legacy aerospace business, Goodrich (acquired in 2011 by United Technologies), Pratt & Whitney, and the newly acquired Rockwell Collins and GE Aviation. It will be an amazing portfolio.   Healthcare             2017 2016 2015     Revenue 19.1 18.3 17.6 billion   Profit Margin 17.8% 17.5% 16.5%     Backlog 18     billion   GE Healthcare provides healthcare diagnostic imaging and clinical systems, life sciences products, and services and digital solutions. Its revenue and profit margin increased from 2015 to 2017 because of the customer demand for integrated precision health solutions as well as increased analytics capability.   Capital             2017 2016 2015     Revenue 9.1 10.9 10.8 billion   Profit Margin -74.7% -11.9% -74.1%     GE Capital provides industrial-aligned financial structuring and product support for GE businesses, including in aviation, healthcare, power, and renewable energy. This is a very important division because it provides the financing that allows GE to conduct financing deals with its customers. GE Capital’s revenues and profit margin decreased from 2015 to 2017 because of charges related to increased reserves for its insurance operations. Also, GE Capital will require $15 billion in capital over the next 7 years. GE Capital is needed but has too many liabilities, and some pieces of it have already been spun off, like Synchrony Financial. The reality is that the portfolio needs to be reviewed again, and more liabilities need to be spun off from the division. It is losing far too much money, and no company or division can survive with billions of dollars in losses.\\n The transportation and lighting businesses, while part of GE’s 2017 annual report, are no longer part of the company’s portfolio because they have been sold off. Some of the sales and spinoffs and restructuring at GE Capital didn’t happen fast enough, and this led to GE's board of directors bringing on a new CEO, Larry Culp, in 2018. GE could have gone further and split the Chairman role from the CEO role and given the Chairman role to a higher-profile person potentially from outside the United States - like Carlos Slim Helu - that knows how to deal with governments around the world. Its long-term goal of focusing on Energy and Aviation requires expertise in dealing with governments. Financial Analysis     GE   Profitability Indicator Ratios 2017 2016 2015   Gross Profit Margin 24.70% 29.27% 29.55%   Operating Profit Margin 9.73% 14.42% 14.36%   Profit Margin Analysis (Net Profit Margin) -4.74% 7.68% 1.45%   Return on Assets -1.56% 2.21% 0.30%   Return on Equity -9.00% 12.52% 1.73%   GE’s gross margin decreased from 2015 to 2017 because of increases in the costs of goods sold and services. Its operating margin decreased from 2015 to 2017 because of increases in sales, general, and administrative expenses. Net profit margin decreased from 2015 to 2017 because of investment contracts, insurance losses, and losses in insurance annuity benefits. The loss of investment contracts swung GE from weak profitability in 2015 to outright loss in 2017. The company’s return on assets and equity dropped sharply from 2015 to 2017 because of its losses in 2017.     GE   Debt Ratios 2017 2016 2015   Debt Ratio 83.00% 79.24% 80.05%   Capitalization Ratio 63.24% 58.18% 60.01%   Interest Coverage Ratio -0.81 2.80 3.36   Financial Leverage Ratio 5.78 5.66 5.81   GE’s debt ratio remained flat from 2015 to 2017 because total borrowing kept growing. The long-term portion of the borrowing is tied to GE Corporation (the oldest senior notes are due in 2055) and the subsidiary, GE Capital. This may be an opportunity for GE to look at selling off GE Capital to reduce long-term liabilities. GE’s capitalization ratio remained above 50% from 2015 to 2017 because of its high proportion of funding from long-term debts rather than from shareholder equity. The company’s interest coverage ratio collapsed from 2015 to 2017 because of a sharp drop in profitability. Its financial leverage ratio remained high from 2015 to 2017 because of drops in shareholder equity due to a more than 10% drop in retained earnings over this period.\\n     GE   Investment Return 2017 2016 2015   Price/Book Value Ratio 1.85 3.65 2.95   Price/Earnings Ratio -20.54 29.16 170.74   Price/Sales Ratio 0.97 2.24 2.47   Dividend Yield 7.28% 3.18% 3.20%   GE’s price-to-book value dropped, primarily because of the sharp drop in its stock price from $30.71 at the end of December 2015 to around $14 in May 2018. This sharp drop was obviously because of the weakened profitability over this time frame, which has made the company much cheaper, potentially moving it into value territory, where Warren Buffett has operated throughout his 60-year career. GE’s price-to-earnings ratio swung sharply from triple digits to a negative value from 2015 to 2017. The number primarily reflects its weakened profitability during this period. GE’s price-to-sales ratio also dropped from 2015 to 2017, which is another sign that the stock had become much cheaper during this period. On a bright note, the company’s dividend yield increased from 2015 to 2017 because of the weakened stock price during this period, as previously discussed. Conclusion Warren Buffett will be looking to buy into GE at its attractive price. He will likely buy the stock currently or to seek a deal for one of its subsidiaries. The company is currently looking to divest $20 billion in assets, which gives Buffett an opportunity to buy at attractive valuations. GE is looking to trim down its exposure to its traditional power businesses and to sell its transportation, lighting, and healthcare businesses. Additionally, it is looking to spin off the oil and gas business. Furthermore, GE can merge with United Technologies to create a world-class aerospace division. These businesses are complementary to businesses that Buffett already owns: the power business is directly complementary to Berkshire Hathaway’s (BRK.A, BRK.B) energy business, and the transportation business is directly complementary to Burlington Northern Santa Fe. Warren Buffett will see many synergies between GE’s portfolio and Berkshire’s current subsidiary businesses, so he will be a buyer at a very attractive price.\\n\\nDisclosure: I am/we are long GE, UTX.

The deal ends the German price war for the business in Europe, creating lots of potential for Takeaway to significantly improve margins in a deal much welcomed by its investors. I like the deal as well, although much of the good news has been priced in already, with investors anticipating a quite aggressive pace of continued revenue and margin progress. About Takeaway Since being founded in the year 2000 in the Netherlands, Takeaway has steadily grown, as it expanded first in Germany in 2007, followed by expansion in other (European) countries, after which it went public in 2016. The basic concept is quite easy. Consumers search for food, order their food and eat. Restaurants receive the orders from consumers through the platform, cook and deliver. As of June 2018, Takeaway had 12.6 million active customers, which can order from more than 36,000 restaurants. On average, these customers order nearly 11 times per year, with trailing orders running at 78 million. For restaurants, this business is quite important. After all, an average restaurant receives about 2,400 orders each year. The overall business is not yet profitable, but the company points towards the Netherlands as an indication of how profitable the business can become. In the Netherlands, EBITDA margins surpass the 50% mark! Through June 2018, the company has reported Gross Merchandise Volume of $1.5 billion on a trailing basis, of which roughly $600 million was generated in both the Netherlands and Germany, complemented by about a hundred million business in Belgium, Poland and Austria. It has a 27% penetration rate for its targeted market in the Netherlands, with penetration rates coming in just shy of 10% in other key countries, which combined represents a $12 billion Gross Merchandise Volume market opportunity.\\n Within the core German market, the company has been increasing market spending in a big way to win the battle from its major peers, thereby depressing margins. About That Deal Just days ahead of Christmas, Takeaway.com announced that it bought the German operations from its German competitor Delivery Hero in a EUR 930 million deal. The deal calls for a EUR 508 million cash component as well as 9.5 million shares representing an amount worth EUR 422 million, or 18% of the share capital of the company. With the deal, Takeaway does not just own its own Lieferando brand, it furthermore owns Lieferheld, Pizza.de and foodora. These 3 brands reported EUR 462 million in gross merchandise value in the first nine months of 2018 on the back of 23 million orders, generating revenues of EUR 76 million. Growth of the operations comes in around the mid-double digits. Note that the company reported a similar order number for its German operations for the same period, as it generated EUR 471 million in gross merchandise volume and just EUR 60 million in revenues. Takeaway is growing much quicker than its peer in Germany, with third quarter order growth accelerating to 40%. If we simply annualise the results for the acquired operations, the EUR 930 million deal values the acquired assets at around 1.5 times gross merchandise volume and little over 9 times sales. In comparison, Takeaway.com was valued at EUR 1.9 billion ahead of the deal announcement, at least its market capitalisation, with the enterprise valuation coming in at roughly the same amount. In that sense, a EUR 930 million deal is very large for Takeaway.com, representing nearly half of the enterprise value before the deal was announced. Valuation Of Takeaway.com At the start of August, Takeaway.com reported results for the first six months of the year. The company grew sales by 42% to more than EUR 110 million. If we annualise that number and work with a EUR 1.9 billion enterprise valuation, shares are valued at 8.6 times sales, in line with the multiple paid for the newly acquired German activities. Based on GMV of EUR 809 million, it trades at 1.2 times annualised gross merchandise value.\\n In that sense, the multiples paid for the German activities look fair in relation to Takeaway's own valuation, although the acquired activities only grow by just around 15%, while the company's growth is roughly three times that percentage. Nonetheless, investors act with great enthusiasm, as shares jumped EUR 12 to EUR 57, marking a huge 27% jump. With 52 million shares outstanding, including the to-be-issued shares, that move corresponds to more than EUR 600 million in value being created, at least from the viewpoint of investors. The reason for that is simple, and it is that this marks the end of the price war in the German market and that Takeaway has won the market definitely. The German activities of Takeaway.com reported negative EBITDA of EUR 21 million on sales of EUR 39 million in the first six months of this year, while the Dutch activities (in which Takeaway is leading) reported positive EBITDA of EUR 25 million on EUR 47 million in sales. If we annualise the German run rate, it could post EUR 80 million in revenues with EUR 42 million in EBITDA losses. Given that the German activities will double to roughly EUR 160 million in sales, the end of the price war could easily result in breakeven or positive EBITDA going forward, including the acquired activities. Assuming 25% EBITDA margins (less than half of the Dutch activities), EBITDA could rise from minus EUR 42 million currently to positive EUR 40 million going forward. That could bode very well for the bottom line of the company going forward. What Now? After having gone public at the end of 2016, shares have seen a huge run higher, having risen from levels in the low twenties to EUR 57 currently, although they have come down from a high of nearly EUR 70 in August of this year. The promise is that the latest deal ensures that Takeaway becomes the dominant player in Europe, as the market leadership position is liked by investors. Operating as essentially a SaaS business, it is easy to understand why investors like the model, as it has proven to be very profitable in the home market the Netherlands, with the German market now on track to become a second profit engine as well.\\n With revenues now running at EUR 300 million per annum, the enterprise value has risen to EUR 3.5 billion following the latest move higher in the share price and the latest deal. This values the company at 11-12 times sales, with pro forma sales essentially growing at around 30-40% per annum. Note that the business still has a huge runway for growth, with about EUR 12 billion in potential GMV, and that works down to potential revenues of EUR 2 billion in the long run. Working with a EUR 1 billion revenue potential in a year or 3-5, based on the assumption that Takeaway becomes the leading platform, and working with operating margins of 30-40% as well as 20% taxes, I see potential earnings of EUR 240-320 million at about EUR 4.50-6.00 per share. With a market multiple of 20 times, that works down to a valuation between EUR 90 and EUR 120 per share if the company delivers, although that requires maybe 5 years from now. That works down to a compounded annual growth rate of 10-16% per annum, which seems fair, but make that shares are far from a bargain currently. Hence, I am not jumping on board the momentum run higher at the moment despite the promise of the deal and end of the German price war, as real growth has to be delivered upon to deliver decent but not necessarily spectacular returns.\\nPlease subscribe to Value In Corporate Events - Marketplace Checkout to obtain premium research on all the latest IPOs, M&A activity and other corporate events.

According to a Mastercard SpendingPulse study, total U.S. retail sales, excluding automobiles, rose 5.1% between November 1 and December 24 from a year earlier. Overall, consumers in the United States spent over $850 billion during the holiday season. Online sales also jumped 26.4% from a year earlier. Not bad for a retail sector that has been a shadow of its former self. In spite of the stock market plummet and the holiday government shutdown, consumers have been more than happy to spend on their loved ones this holiday season. Craig Johnson, president of Customer Growth Partners, put it best when he said, “Wall Street is running around like a chicken with its head cut off, while Mr. and Mrs. Main Street are happy with their jobs, enjoying their best wage increase in a decade.” According to Johnson, the latest drop in gas prices helped consumers take a little more out of their pockets. As consumers realize deeper pockets, they were in more of a giving than saving mood this past month. The retail industry can sleep easily this week, but they are in for an uncertain future. Next year presents a challenging market for retail as buying continues to shift online. This has been a market trend that has hurt department stores - especially former giants such as Sears (OTCPK:SHLDQ) and Toys\"R\"Us. Mastercard SpendingPulse tracked sales from November 1 to December 24 and found that sales fell 1.3%. Despite the strong economic trends for retail, in-store visits are not as plentiful as they once were. Retail is evolving to become digital, and increasingly, mobile. This is a trend that will not slow down, and retailers have no choice but to adapt or die. As a result, retailers are going to enter 2019 hesitant for what the future might bring. With rising interest rates and volatility in Washington, D.C., this is an industry that will be completely altered come 2020. Some retailers, such as TJ Maxx (TJX), had positive trading years, but the truth of the matter is that not all retailers will survive 2019. E-commerce has changed the game, and many of these retailers are gambles to invest in.\\n The nicest of them all And who could be responsible for these alterations to the retail sector? The answer, of course, is Amazon (AMZN). The giant said on Wednesday that the number of voice-activated orders placed via Alexa were three times greater during the 2018 holiday season than they were in the last year. Amazon couldn’t let retailers have all of the fun over the holidays and insisted on getting involved. Thanks in part to its same-day delivery service on Christmas Eve, Amazon shipped more than one billion products for free through its Amazon Prime subscription service. This caused the stock price to jump about 90 points in the first day of post-Christmas trading. This holiday jump could not have come at a better time for Amazon, as it has been struggling recently. Since the company briefly topped $1 trillion in market capitalization in September, the stock has been falling - down almost 30%. This has put the company in a position for its worst quarter since the 2008 recession, when it lost 30% of its value. In 2008, Amazon was a completely different company, as Amazon Web Services came in 2006 and the lucrative Kindle a year later. The company has grown a lot since then, so the 30% drop is reminiscent of a prehistoric Amazon, causing investors to worry. Worry not, investors, Amazon is not the only company that has been falling. The stock market in general has been tanking out of concerns of rising interest rates and political instability, both domestic and abroad. Tech companies have been leading the surge to the bottom, with Facebook (FB) undoubtedly leading the charge, but for other reasons. Apple (AAPL) fell 30% this quarter, Microsoft (MSFT) dipped 12%, and Facebook dropped 18%. Although Amazon is having trouble staying above 1,400 in the recent months, the company has a lot to look forward to in 2019. \\n\\n\\n AMZN stock price certainly felt the positive effects of the holiday season, jumping as high as $1,440 on December 26th. However, the price came back to earth on the days following Christmas, and the stock is trading at around $1,400. Amazon Web Services Amazon has long dominated the retail space, but the truth of the matter is that many retailers have Amazon figured out. A lot of companies can model themselves after Amazon in the low-margin digital retail space. E-commerce is Amazon’s claim to fame, and the company still accounts for 49% of all online retail sales. But with competitors figuring out the market, this space is no longer that profitable. In fact, the operating margin has decreased to about 2.3%. Trading profits for market cap is no longer a viable business strategy; luckily, Amazon has other things in the works. The majority of the company’s bottom line continues to come from Amazon Web Services (AWS), its cloud computing segment. This is a segment that generates 59% of Amazon’s operating profits (thanks to its operating margin) despite contributing 11% of total revenue. Per Danny Vena of The Motley Fool, revenue from AWS could triple over the coming four years, giving the segment a market value of $350 billion. In fact, Jefferies & Co. analyst Brent Thill sees major growth out of AWS in the coming future: “Jefferies & Company analyst Brent Thill ran some calculations after attending Amazon\\'s re:Invent cloud-computing conference late last month. Thill sees AWS generating sales of $26 billion this year and reaching revenue of $71 billion annually by 2022, giving AWS a market value of $350 billion. Earlier this year, Amazon\\'s market cap briefly topped $1 trillion, but it\\'s currently worth about $766 billion. Thill made the case back in April that AWS would triple over five years, topping $60 billion by 2022, so his latest call is even more enthusiastic.” These numbers are undoubtedly enthusiastic but not as ambitious as they may sound. AWS produced $18.2 billion in revenue for the first nine months of this year. While we wait for the earnings of the fourth quarter to be released, AWS would need to produce $7.8 billion in revenue (or YOY growth of 52%) to hit on Thill’s estimate. And if there is any company that can return on this projection, it would be Amazon.\\n Part of the enthusiasm that analysts are feeling towards AWS comes in the wake of Amazon’s large announcements about the cloud platform. Biotech company Amgen (AMGN) is in the process of converting almost every one of its business processes to AWS, while mortgage processing specialist Ellie Mae (ELLI) and Guardian Life (private) have chosen to use Amazon. Another big commitment to AWS is Korean Airlines, a top 10 airline worldwide. The deals that Amazon continues to strike with companies and its AWS service are impressive, plentiful, and likely to grow even more as AWS establishes itself in the cloud computing world. Competition in this space is with tech giants like Microsoft and Alphabet (GOOGL), so success won’t come so easy. Google Cloud and Microsoft Azure are worthy opponents, but currently, AWS is dominating the space. Gartner forecasts cloud computing to be a $300 billion business by 2021 as companies increasingly adopt cloud services to achieve business outcomes through digital speed and ability. These top players will battle it out for market share in 2020, but AWS is poised for success. The competitors have closed the gap in market cap, but most estimates put AWS at 33% of market share. \\n\\n As a driver of Amazon’s bottom line, AWS’s success indicates that the company is not as one-dimensional in the e-commerce sector as one might think. In spite of growing holiday success in the retail space the company dominates, AWS represents why Amazon is still a buy. In terms of valuation, it trades at a much higher price than any of the competitors in the retail and cloud-computing space. Amazon has a forward P/E of 50.32, while its largest competitors in retail, Walmart and Target, trade with forward P/Es of 18 and 10.97, respectively. Microsoft trades with a forward P/E of 18. Amazon is so expensive mostly due to its lofty EPS projections, which analysts predict will grow by 44% over the next five years. The company has always traded at a lucrative price, but aside from the stock market dip, it has always been worth it.\\n Bezos was the first to achieve dominance in the online retail space and is among the first to explore cloud computing. Analysts’ projections in market position, growth, and operating margin are all rising, and for that, Amazon may be expensive, but it is a Buy at its current price.\\nDisclosure: I/we have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.
