President Trump, Chairman Powell’s colleagues and Mr Market may be less enthusiastic about this prospect. \\n\\n President Truman wanted a one-handed economist. The Volcker Fed had a one-handed Chairman. President Trump allegedly wants to dismember the current Fed Chairman. Chairman Powell may appear to have only one hand, but the Federal Reserve actually has three-handed economists in practice! Chairman Powell’s shaky hand continues to point in the direction of a “gradual” normalization on auto-pilot. Mr Market however recently told Chairman Powell that he needs more hands on deck asap. It’s therefore time for a subtle change of hands ladies and gentlemen. Mr Market has not yet noted that the Fed in fact has three hands. Three hands and two mandates make for even more mischief than Mr Market could have imagined is possible. If the Fed has got it wrong on its current auto pilot setting, then more than just a recession will be the consequence. Fed independence is now at risk more than it has ever been. Voter-friendly Congressmen, with an eye to the next Presidential election, will throw the Fed under the bus for faithfully following its dual mandate with consummate ease, if the economy goes south from here.\\n The Fed has failed to call any of the last recessions apart from the one Chairman Volcker deliberately created. Neither has a Fed Chairman been fired for getting it wrong. With no risk of punishment, there is no incentive to get it right. Unless Chairman Powell sees the same situation developing as Volcker did, which must be a long way off even if it is coming, the current disconnect only serves to affirm and strengthen Mr Market’s convictions, and thereby undermine the credibility of Powell. Indeed Powell has already discounted the Volcker outcome, with his intuitive assertion that globalization has structurally depressed inflation. Maybe in fairness, Chairman Powell’s current hang-up is that the current breakdown of the global trading system will reignite the old Volcker era’s inflation dynamics. If this is so, however, the current performance of energy and commodity prices should convince Powell that this risk is not elevating but is in fact falling. More likely, Powell like all his colleagues is simply scared by the size of the Fed’s balance sheet; and in the absence of a crisis lacks the context and motivation for maintaining it. Creating a crisis is therefore his raison d’etre, which he denies with words but does with his actions knowingly or otherwise. \\n\\n (Source: Federal Reserve Board Staff Forecasts) Mr Market has looked at the latest Hawkish FOMC statement with accompanying staff projections and assumed that the Fed will in fact create a recession circa Presidential election time. It’s a fair assumption as we shall see. Missing from the staff projections is a forecast of the Fed’s balance sheet over the forecast period. The whole forecast page blissfully omits the very real fact that the Fed is shrinking its balance sheet, or perhaps it’s factored into the other data on the page (unlikely). If included, it would show the balance sheet on auto pilot, shrinking at $50 Billion a month. That’s $600 billion a year and $1.2 Trillion between now and 2021, hardly chump change even before one understands that it has been leveraged up several times since it was first QE injected. It took roughly ten years to get the balance sheet up to around $4 Trillion. It will take less than half of that time to unwind it at the current rate of decay in an economy that is already decelerating. This asymmetry is much more important than the Fed’s alleged symmetrical inflation target.\\n \\n\\n (Source: Chicago Fed) The Chicago Fed’s Adjusted National Financial Conditions Index (ANFCI) neatly illustrates how monetary conditions have been getting tighter since late 2015. It also shows how things are getting even tighter of late. It is useful to use the “Adjustments” area of the ANFCI as the proxy for the degree of financial conditions tightening. Using this proxy it can be shown that financial conditions have tightened since the Fed initially started raising interest rates, cutting reserves and latterly starting to shrink its balance sheet. Balance sheet withdrawal has a negatively leveraged economic impact in terms of both time and price, just as it gave a leveraged boost on the way in. That was the whole point of it in the first place or so we were told by Chairman Bernanke at the time. The Fed has very audibly and transparently pre-committed to tighten monetary policy, by nature of auto-pilot balance sheet reduction. As Chairman Powell reminded at the last FOMC : \"I think that the runoff of the balance sheet has been smooth and has served its purpose,\" and \"I don\\'t see us changing that.\" This guidance is on auto-pilot and has been fired and forgotten by the Chairman, even though its impacts are clearly being felt in domestic and global capital markets. The Fed’s little balance sheet omission critically removes some very important context for the whole forecast. If this were to be included, it would show that monetary policy has been tightening and will continue to do so as the balance sheet shrinks. Combining this with the interest rate increase projections shown in the Fed forecast is a significantly greater monetary policy tightening than initial impressions perceive. No wonder then that forecast GDP collapses from 2018 to 2019! In reality, GDP may collapse even more under the leveraged impact of balance sheet withdrawal magnified with higher interest rates. It’s hard to see why inflation and employment wouldn’t also collapse with this tightening of monetary policy even though the Fed forecast them to remain unchanged.\\n Chairman Powell, on the other hand, believes that he is projecting and working towards a normal American economy in time for the next Presidential election. He is even on record for promising to deliver an extended business cycle with no inflation all the way to the next election. Thus far, he has delivered his promise in the form of the latest FOMC forecasts. Nothing short of a recession, in the form of rising unemployment and falling inflation outside the boundaries of the latest Fed forecasts, between now and 2020 would allegedly change his conviction. If Chairman Powell thinks that he can deflate risk asset prices in such a short space of time between now and 2021 without triggering a financial crisis, he is overly optimistic at best and delusional at worst. It took about ten years of QE to create this situation. It should therefore be unwound over a period of time no shorter in duration and preferably of a similar-to-much-longer duration since economic growth and inflation are subdued. At the outset, it was not clear how long it would take to get into this situation, so it is certainly not clear how long it will take to unwind, hence the need for the extra caution which is currently lacking. Chairman Powell is not being “gradual” at all; he is being dangerously “swift”. Firing and then forgetting about an untested program to shrink an unprecedentedly huge balance sheet is a concern. It demonstrates either a lack of understanding of the economic circumstances or a refusal to take responsibility for the outcome. Looked at positively, it could show that rather than take risks with his poor judgement, the Chairman has decided to go into auto-pilot mode with much less dramatic consequences. Raising interest rates is the final incremental straw since the damage is already done but totally consistent with this profile that seeks automatic rather custom designed solutions and policies. If 2019 is a rerun of 2018, the positive US interest rate differential will again suck-in global capital, thereby weakening the global economy further and providing a tailwind to the domestic US economy. The Fed apparently does not think this, however, since it has forecast a massive fall in GDP in 2019, which curiously appears to have no proportionate impact on either inflation or employment. This little anomaly and its significant implications will be explained shortly.\\n Chairman Powell, true to his Congressional mandates, is thus doing his job at the expense of the global economy. Whilst the Fed pays lip-service to the global economy and its headwinds, in practice it has not factored them in. Why should it when global trade is only about 12% of US GDP? The current focus on the rampant US consumer, who is 70% of GDP, is obviously the priority. The reason to focus on the global economy is one of financial stability risk. If the global economy implodes because it is starved of US Dollars, then foreign financial institutions with Dollar assets and liabilities will fail. The risk to the US economy then comes through its exposure to these global institutions. Balance sheet reduction alone, is starving the global economy of US Dollars. Attracting what Dollars are left back to America, with higher interest rates, is just the final nail in the coffin for the global economy. A full blown trade war would just make the situation even worse. \\n\\n (Source: Seeking Alpha) The July report in this series noted that Chairman Powell and his team showed the inertial bias towards inflation fighting, despite their protestations to be pursuing a symmetrical inflation target. The Fed talks a good game on letting inflation overshoot, yet its actions show a horror of this ever happening. The FOMC appears to have had a horror at the Trump fiscal stimulus and its tailwind in 2017. This became a self-reinforcing conviction as labor markets tightened to new lows and headline inflation began to tick up in mid-2018. Despite the FOMC’s horror, however, this never really kicked in to the Dot Plots and other forecasts. The inconsistency of behavior and guidance is a characteristic of the Fed that increasingly is undermining its credibility of commitment. As we shall see, this inconsistency is a systemic design of the Fed. It thus undermines itself by design!\\n \\n\\n (Source: Euronomist) This bias can be viewed as the Fed’s failure to consistently distinguish between inflation as an economic indicator on one hand, a forecast on the other and then a mandated target on the Fed’s mysterious invisible third hand. This is in fact the essence of Fed guidance. Furthermore, in reacting to the behavior of Mr Market, the Fed clearly switches between these three distinctions and hands. The same inconsistency principle can be applied to the full employment mandate, although this is clearly a lesser priority for the Fed right now. The combination of probable scenarios from two mandates and three hands can be quite confusing (deliberately so) for Mr Market and quite beneficial to the Fed. This failure to consistently interpret the dual mandates is a serious institutional failing of the Fed that Congress should be made aware of and should investigate. The first thing to do should be to get the dual mandate correct from first principles, if reform of the Fed’s monetary policy framework is to be successful in 2019 under Powell. A quick look at the latest Fed “forecasts” (see above) will show how unemployment and inflation data are actually being used as targets whilst being presented as forecasts. A quick look at the latest speech from John Williams will show how they are being used as indicators. \\n\\n (Source: Seeking Alpha) The Fed’s anti-inflation bias was earlier identified in the May report in this series, as a consequence of the Fed’s institutional failure to fully embrace its inflation target as a symmetrical one. Fed speakers like John Williams talked the talk of inflation overshooting, but they have never sincerely walked the talk. At that time it was also noted that the Fed’s domestic inertial economic optimism would run into the depressing global headwinds before it had reached its target for the neutral rate. This bias remains strong based on the Chairman’s performance at the latest FOMC. This bias was viewed as inappropriate back then even though oil was on a tear and dragging inflation upwards with it. If it was inappropriate back in May and July, it is egregious now given that oil is falling and the global economy is imploding.\\n New York Fed President John Williams was the first-responder to the carnage created by Chairman Powell’s one hand. As the Fed’s real market interface, the New York Fed has this unfortunate default position. Trying not to cast aspersions on Chairman Powell’s ability, Williams did his best (and failed) to narrow the disconnect between Mr Market’s expectations curve and the Fed’s. How this will play out in practice is by the Fed suddenly changing its “target” (see above “forecast”) for GDP falling massively from 3% in 2018 to an “indicator” of 2.3% at some point 2019. Said “indicator” will then be explained as being below “target”, thus allowing the Fed to pause and even consider easing. A new higher “target” will then be presented to justify the new pause/ease policy. For this little mixing of metaphors to be successful, the Fed requires inflation to remain subdued. Right now this looks to be a good bet, since the Fed has been doing its best to crush it of late. Mr Market has however already begun discounting this massive real slowdown in the economy into asset prices. Some nonchalant guidance from Fed speakers in 2019 will then try and make the transition from “target” to “indicator” as imperceptible as possible. The Fed hopes that by then, Mr Market will be so busy discounting the pause and potential ease that he will not call it out for its noble lies. Williams made the error of failing to note that since Mr Market is forward looking and the Fed currently remains historic data dependent, this divergence of opinion and its negative consequences for the real economy can persist until the Fed becomes forward looking. The two observers will thus start the New Year continuing to read and act from different pages. Also speaking post-FOMC meeting, Cleveland Fed President Loretta Mester confirmed this page divergence with her explanation that “perhaps they (markets) are inferring something about the economy, we are not seeing in the data.” Williams has also failed to note that the negative halo effect from Chairman Powell’s mishandling of the last FOMC communication now touches and frames his own guidance. In order to change perceptions of himself and then extend this positive halo to change perceptions of Chairman Powell, it will take more than Williams’ latest ritual act of contrition. Going forward, it will be interesting to see if and how Fed speakers distance themselves from and then reframe Powell, should he maintain his current inertia as the data vitiates against his normalize on auto-pilot viewpoint.\\n \\n\\n (Source: Seeking Alpha) Of more interest than Williams and Mester’s placing of the fig leaf over Chairman Powell’s embarrassing exposure at the last FOMC was the Kansas City Fed’s inadvertent exposure of this same object. A previous report has noted that it would be a significant failing of Chairman Powell’s new financial stability risk management framework were he to ignore the input from what has been called the Regional Fed. Kansas City Fed President Esther George will rotate into the voting chair in 2019, so this growing structural dilemma will be highlighted. Said Regional Fed has been significantly more Dovish than the Washington Fed of late, with the Beige Book now ostensibly calling for a pause in the rate hike process. It now transpires that the Kansas City Regional Fed was against the latest rate hike. It will be interesting to see if its President and renowned Hawk Esther George goes with the data and input from her own team or if she follows the Washington Fed line in the future. The regional context for the caution at the Kansas Fed is easily understood. With an economy fundamentally driven by energy and agriculture in its footprint, the global headwinds are felt acutely there. Risks are now finely balanced in this footprint, so the Kansas City Regional Fed would like to take a pause to assess the damage. If President Trump has noted the “forecast” sudden deceleration in GDP in 2019, he will tactically blame the Fed for this, thereby forcing them to pause and even to consider easing. All the President’s Tweets suggest that blame is being conveniently attached to the Fed as he controls the narrative. If and when the Fed pauses, he will maintain this control with an “I told you so” Tweet.\\n \\n\\n (Source: St Louis Fed) As St Louis Fed President James Bullard rotates into the voting seat in 2019, it is instructive to know what his research team have been providing him with intelligence on. The inverted yield curve appears to be something that he is going to use with great effect in 2019. A recent Blog report informs us that the inverted yield curve acts as an economic headwind through the banking sector for the following reasons: \\n\\n (Source: St Louis Fed)  An inversion could cause loans to be less profitable relative to the bank’s cost of funds. An inversion would cause their banks to be less risk tolerant. An inversion may signal a less favorable or more uncertain economic outlook.  A cursory look at Japan will confirm these findings. If the US banking sector is therefore pulling its horns in, as a consequence of the inverted yield curve, the wisdom of putting it under further pressure by continuing to withdraw crisis stimulus reserves is questionable. The wisdom of tightening capital market liquidity by raising interest rates and cutting the Fed’s balance sheet back is also questionable under the same circumstances. Banks will simply go long Treasuries (as they have done) as interest rates rise, because they offer a more attractive risk adjusted reward than riskier lending. Where the BOJ scores more highly than the Fed is that it has held onto its JGB’s when the curve was inverting, thereby preventing the banks from stockpiling them. Unfortunately for the BOJ, crowding the banks out of the JGB market has not forced them into the commercial lending market because the yield curve is too flat. The BOJ has thus recently adopted Yield Curve Control in order to stimulate bank lending out along the yield curve. The Fed should note the BOJ’s travails closely, since the inverted US yield curve is creating a similar problem even though US interest rates are positive.\\n The St Louis Fed researchers have found and illustrated graphically that traditionally a curve inversion triggers banks to tighten lending standards. This then causally creates recession conditions in extremis. They have also shown that President Trump’s policies to collocate a fiscal stimulus with an easing of banking standards have prolonged the credit cycle expansion which had been traditionally rolling over just before he was elected. President Trump triggered an extension of the credit and business cycle. He also triggered some serious partisan reaction from the Fed. The Fed’s zealous continuing to reach for the new normal rate, in horror at Trump’s policies, is also clearly evident in the St Louis Fed’s epigraphic findings. This brings us to an approaching tipping point soon at which the banks aggressively tighten credit again. The recent mass exodus from leveraged loans and general riskoff sentiment look like very clear signals that this point has just been passed. Anecdotally, this tipping point flips the Fed’s horror at him to President Trump’s horror at it. In its reaction to President Trump, the Fed has acted politically even though it can legally claim that its reactions are consistent with its dual mandate interpretation. Bullard can be expected to advocate not only for a pause in interest rate hikes but also a request for the Fed to revisit the process of balance sheet shrinkage and reserve reduction. \\n\\n (Source: Bloomberg) The latest consumer expectations data suggests that the American consumer has finally started to pay attention to what’s going on globally and what’s going on at home politically and economically. An equity market correction always heightens this awareness. The fall in consumer expectations can be seen as the erosion of the confidence that President Trump had created when he was elected. Since it is (or was) the consumer who is (was) holding the economy up, the economic slowdown foretold by Mr Market has now been foretold by the consumer’s expectations.\\n\\n\\n (Source: Gallup) Underlining the sliding consumer confidence data is the latest Gallup mood poll. The mood of Americans is in transition from confident to something less so, especially in relation to the economy. \\n\\n (Source: Philadelphia Fed) Lingering worries over rising inflation expectations have abated since November if the Philly Fed’s Term Structure of Inflation Expectations can be trusted. The Fed can pause, but it must also take note that it is now behind the curve after the latest rate hike and will automatically fall further behind as it shrinks its balance sheet and cuts bank reserves on auto-pilot. \\n\\n (Source: Seeking Alpha) As the President advised, better to “take the victory” than be blamed for the slowdown. \\n\\n Switching from auto-pilot to manual would seem to be the right thing to do, assuming that Chairman Powell has the confidence to take the controls.\\nDisclosure: I/we have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

However, today as I write this article, it is 53 degrees in the Indianapolis, Indiana area, it is close to 50 degrees in Chicago, Illinois, where natural gas futures are traded at the CME Group (CME), and it is projected to be 56 degrees in New York City, New York, which is the epicenter of the financial markets. This warmer weather has generally persisted for much of December in the U.S. after a colder-than-normal November, undercutting the strength in natural gas prices that had bubbled to the surface in November. Additionally, and perhaps most pertinent to near-term natural gas prices, warm weather has brought back memories, and fears of the historically warm back-to-back winters of 2015/2016 and 2016/2017, so natural gas bullish investors have run for the exits, quietly ignoring the price strength that had been developing in natural gas prices for six of the previous eight months before November\\'s launch higher. Building on this narrative even further, warmer-than-expected December weather has overshadowed a very bullish development, specifically the cratering of crude oil prices, which is going to put a lid on the rapid growth of associated natural gas production.\\n Thus far, investors have only focused on the negatives, selling in mass energy equities, and punished the natural gas focused equities, like Antero Resources (AR), that have significant liquids production. The natural gas futures price curve is trying to digest this decline in crude oil prices, which is bullish longer-term for dry natural gas prices, and the price action there is much more telling sign, in my opinion, than the recent near-term weakness in natural gas prices, and this creates an even more compelling opportunity in the downtrodden natural gas equity prices. Investment Thesis Near-term volatile price moves in natural gas prices have masked a stable natural gas futures price curve, and this is positive divergence for the downtrodden, out-of-favor natural gas equities. Unfavorable Weather Has Subdued Natural Gas Prices The famous saying is that a picture says a thousand words, and one look at the performance in natural gas prices over the past month says everything you need to know about December of 2018 weather versus expectations one month ago. \\n\\n (Source: Author, StockCharts.com) Looking at the chart above, natural gas prices have given back almost all their November 2018 gains; however, they remain higher by 20.1% year-to-date, which is quite the accomplishment considering almost every major asset class is materially negative, with the exception of cash, in calendar 2018. The United States Natural Gas Fund (UNG) has actually moderately outperformed natural gas prices year-to-date, as price backwardation in the front-month contracts has contributed to a positive roll yield. \\n\\n\\n (Source: Author, StockCharts.com) Longer-term, the United States Natural Gas Fund has been a very poor investment, due in part to the almost continual negative roll yield, so the recent price backwardation in natural gas futures prices is something to keep an eye on going forward. Bigger picture, near-term natural gas prices remain above their January 2018 highs. \\n\\n (Source: Author, StockCharts.com) Will front-month natural gas prices remain over their January 2018 highs? Really, that is weather dependent, and nobody knows on this front, pardon the pun, so only time will tell; however, future prices have largely ignored the positive and negative weather volatility. Natural Gas Futures Prices Much More Tame In an article published on December 19th, I looked at the CME Group\\'s natural gas futures prices from December 19th, and December 2nd, and came to the conclusion that not much had changed outside of the winter 2018/2019 natural gas prices. To illustrate this, the below two tables taken from the previous two articles show natural gas futures prices from December 2nd, which is shown first, and then December 19th. \\n\\n (December 2nd, 2018, Natural Gas Prices. Source: CME Group) \\n\\n\\n (December 19th, 2018, Natural Gas Prices. Source: CME Group) I pointed out in the previous article that the natural gas futures price curve really had not changed that much from December 2nd to December 19th, with many monthly prices past the winter of 2018/2019 actually having slight increases. This narrative has held true in the time since, meaning front-month prices have decreased moderately, yet the bulk of the futures price curve has increased from where they were on December 2nd, 2018, when looking at natural gas futures prices today, on the morning of Friday, December 28th, 2019. \\n\\n (December 28th, 2018, Natural Gas Prices. Source: CME Group) Summarizing the above three natural gas futures price tables, natural gas futures prices have declined since December 2nd, 2018, for the winter months of 2018/2019, yet past April of 2019, natural gas futures prices have increased for nearly every month, from May of 2019 through the summer of 2019 through the winter months of 2019/2020. Thus, despite some near-term price weakness in natural gas prices, futures prices have actually showed some price strength. Natural Gas Equities Have Went In The Opposite Direction Despite the strength in natural gas futures prices from May of 2019 through the winter of 2019/2020, year-to-date price performance charts of Antero Resources, Cabot Oil & Gas (COG), Chesapeake Energy (CHK), CNX Resources (CNX), EQT Corporation (EQT), Gulfport Energy (GPOR), Range Resources (RRC), and Southwestern Energy (SWN), which are all top-ten U.S. natural gas producers show that the leading natural gas producers have clearly diverged from natural gas prices in terms of price performance. Looking at these price performance charts below, keep in mind that natural gas prices are still up 20.1% YTD, and natural gas prices have been up 7 of the past 10 months, inclusive of December.\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n (Source: Author, StockCharts.com)\\n With YTD losses ranging from Cabot\\'s -16.1% and CNX Resources\\' -17.4% on the high end to the -44.2%, -45.6%, and -48.8% losses of Chesapeake Energy, Gulfport Energy, and Antero Resources, respectively, on the low end, it is clear that the positive price action in natural gas prices both in near-term prices and in the futures curve has been overshadowed by weakness in oil prices and natural gas liquids prices, which historically have been highly correlated with oil prices. Oil Prices Plunge; However, There Is A Silver Lining In the span of roughly three months, $WTIC oil prices have went from being up over 26% YTD in early October 2018 to be down over -26% in late December 2018. \\n\\n (Source: Author, StockCharts.com) Frankly, the price action is pretty remarkable, and it speaks partially to the unwind in crowded trades that has been ongoing throughout 2018. Parallel to the decline in oil prices, the United States Oil Fund (USO) has dropped from its highs, up nearly 34% in early October to down nearly -20% YTD. \\n\\n (Source: Author, StockCharts.com) With the reversal of price action, and sentiment in oil prices, it is no surprise that that this has dragged down the natural gas equities, almost all of whom have focused on their liquid-rich production the past several years, particularly the more liquids heavy producers, including Chesapeake, Gulfport, and Antero Resources. Investors should keep in mind, however, that even though these companies, particularly the above-mentioned three, have a lot of liquids production, natural gas prices are still responsible for a majority of their revenues and profits.\\n For example, Chesapeake Energy has focused almost all of its growth capital expenditures on oil and liquids production the past five years, yet natural gas revenues account for roughly 80% of CHK\\'s revenues. On this note, Antero Resources issued a December 18th, 2018, press release where it specifically noted the monetization of previous hedges, debt deleveraging, share repurchases, and perhaps most importantly the positive impact of the recent strength in natural gas prices outweighing the negative impact of lower liquids prices. This is particularly important from my perspective as Antero Resources is the largest U.S. producer of natural gas liquids. Here is a direct quote on this topic from the press release, with bold emphasis added by your author.  Glen Warren, President and CFO, commented: \"The monetization and restructuring of a portion of our hedge portfolio allows Antero to further delever, while maintaining upside to the natural gas strip in 2019. Antero was able to capture a portion of the value in its 2019 fixed price swaps. We believe that futures prices do not accurately reflect current low storage levels and strong demand growth fundamentals. This monetization builds upon the delevering process that we started in 2017 with our initial hedge monetization. At that time, Antero had a stand-alone leverage ratio of 3.2x. The monetization will further strengthen our balance sheet as we target a stand-alone leverage profile below 2.2x by year-end 2018.\" Mr. Warren (President & CFO) continued: \"In addition, the sharp increase in natural gas prices this fall and the shift of more of our gas to Midwest markets due to the opening of the ET Rover Sherwood Lateral in November substantially offset the negative impact of lower oil and natural gas liquids (\\'NGL\\') prices during the fourth quarter. The repurchase of $129 million of our stock, or 3% of shares outstanding, was primarily funded through the free cash flow we are generating this quarter, delivering on our stated goal of returning the majority of free cash flow to our shareholders. Given our discounted valuation based on our firm value to EBITDAX multiple and NAV metrics, we believe repurchasing shares is an attractive use of capital.\" (Source: Antero Resources December 18th, 2018 Press Release) \\n From a shareholder perspective, there is nothing negative about the press release above, and I am sure that Seth Klarman, who is one of the greatest value investors of all-time, and a large holder and acquirer of AR shares over the past year and of Antero Resources\\' equity at much higher prices, agrees with the actions taken by AR\\'s management, which itself owns a material amount of AR shares. For perspective, look at the price action of AR since Klarman first began buying shares in 2014. \\n\\n (Source: Author, StockCharts.com) Now, remember AR\\'s YTD 2018 share price performance that was presented earlier. \\n\\n (Source: Author, StockCharts.com)  Looking at the above two charts, clearly there has been an unwind, even a price capitulation in AR, in energy equities in general and in natural gas focused equities specifically. Given this backdrop, why is AR monetizing hedges now? One answer is that it knows, as the largest natural gas liquids producer, and the seventh largest dry natural gas producer, that lower liquids prices, particularly oil prices, are going to put pressure on associated natural gas production, which is primarily the byproduct from oil drilling, specifically in the Permian Basin, which has seen the most robust production growth of the shale basins. A reduction in future oil production growth has the potential to significantly negatively impact the projected production growth in associated natural gas production, putting upward pressure on dry natural gas prices, depending, of course, on how long the downturn in crude oil prices persists.\\n In summary, the key takeaway from AR\\'s press release is that even the natural gas equities with substantial oil and liquids production, including Antero Resources as the largest domestic natural gas liquids producer, are benefiting from the increase in dry natural gas prices in the fourth quarter of 2018, which has offset the declines in oil prices and natural gas liquids prices. Closing Thoughts - Substantial Opportunity In Out-Of-Favor Sectors & Out-Of-Favor Equities After a decade-long bull market in the broader U.S. stock market, 2018 has presented an obstacle to this advance, with out-sized equity market volatility and significant draw-downs from the January highs early in 2018, in October of 2018, and now in December of 2018. Simultaneously, 2018 has seen a long-awaited price breakout in dry natural gas prices, which have been in an almost parallel decade long bear market that has run side-by-side with the broader U.S. equity bull market. Warmer winter weather, specifically in late December of 2018, has quickly brought back (to natural gas investors\\' minds) the haunting fears of the historically warm back-to-back winters of 2015/2016 and 2016/2017, and these fears have effectively torpedoed the burgeoning natural gas rally that had previously exploded higher in November of 2018. Looking past the weather, there are positive developments in natural gas futures prices that have largely been ignored by natural gas equities, which have plunged in unison, with the heaviest losses suffered by natural gas equities focused on oil and liquids production growth. The silver lining to the current doom and gloom is that dry natural gas prices have largely offset the decline in liquids prices, illustrated by Antero Resources with its December 18th, 2018, press release. An additional silver lining is that lower oil prices have the potential to substantially slow associated gas production growth, particularly in the Permian basin, where natural gas is often sold at any price available, which has included near $0 and below.\\n Wrapping up, a slowing of associated gas production growth could significantly increase future natural gas prices from the often draconian assumptions for future natural gas prices that are used by Wall Street today, with Morgan Stanley (MS), perhaps the most bearish of the pack of negative analysts, including AllianceBernstein (AB) and Goldman Sachs (GS) on longer-term natural gas prices. Ultimately, fundamentals do matter, and as investors return to their roots, I believe \"2019 Is Going To Be A Banner Year For Value Equities\", and price discovery, which has been largely absent from the markets for the majority of the past decade, will eventually return with a vengeance. In this environment, value equities are going to vastly outperform growth equities, partly facilitated by a rise in interest rates, which reduces the long-duration asset appeal of the most esteemed growth equities. While we are just embarking on this journey, we are nowhere near being there yet, and we have a long way to go to rediscover price discovery. To close, even though it has been a very difficult stretch for value-oriented investors, I think we are about to enter a golden age for active, value investors who do the fundamental work, who can find the diamonds in the rough, turnaround candidates, and high cash flow generating companies of today, and the most out-of-favor sectors and the most out-of-favor equities will be at the forefront of this opportunity. \\nThe Contrarian.

Ever since the Great Recession, value-oriented retailers have thrived, as the hunt for bargains has become collectively more popular among consumers. This has produced great benefits for chains like Ross, and shareholders have been rewarded handsomely. But of late, general market weakness and fear over the retail sector in general have created opportunities in retail stocks that used to be quite expensive. Ross happens to be one of those stocks, and while it isn't particularly cheap now, it is fairly priced for the first time in a long time, and that makes it worth a look from the long side. \\n\\n Results continue to support the bulls The company's recent results have continued to be strong, as they have for years at this point. Ross is too big to be growing the top line at double-digit rates and boosting margins enormously; those gains have been accrued in past years. However, Ross is very efficient with its margins, so profitability is high, but the trade-off is that growth from here is somewhat limited on that front. However, that doesn't mean the growth story is dead by any means.\\n The first three quarters of this year have seen sales rise 8%, thanks to 5% from new stores and a 3% comparable sales gain. Ross has produced what can only be described as an incredible streak of comparable sales gains in the past decade as it seems there is no ceiling. Many retailers run into a point with their comparable sales where they cannot move higher due to having reached peak demand. For Ross, it appears such a rule doesn't apply, and it continues to build upon prior comparable sales gains year after year. Indeed, the first three quarters of this year put a 3% comparable sales gain on top of a 4% gain in the same period last year, an astonishing total considering how large Ross is and how long it has been doing this. Gross margins have fallen fractionally thus far this year, as I mentioned. The damage, however, has been very slight and hasn't derailed the growth story. Merchandise margin actually increased, but that gain was more than offset by higher freight costs and buying expenses. SG&A costs have deleveraged, as well as that line item has grown at ~10% this year, thanks to wage pressure, against an 8% gain in revenue, meaning operating margins have fallen. Indeed, they've declined 70bps to 13.8% year-over-year, which is a meaningful decline. However, Ross is growing enough with the top line in addition to boosting EPS with buybacks that the bull case isn't derailed by lower margins. It is also worth nothing that 2017's operating margin level of 14.5% was a company record, so it isn't like Ross is struggling; it just isn't producing yet another record for 2018. Indeed, management said long-term operating margins are targeted to be maintained in the area of +/- 14%, so margin growth isn't going to be a significant driver of earnings growth in the years to come. Growth will keep coming for many years While I think that Ross' margins are at or near their peak longer-term, growth is still coming in a big way. Comparable sales are a steady, low-single-digit tailwind to revenue, but the company's store expansion efforts are where the real gains will be made.\\n \\n\\n Source: Investor presentation, page 4 This slide from a November investor presentation shows the company's locations for Ross and dd's DISCOUNTS stores across the US. Ross currently has just under 1,500 stores while dd's is just under 250. That's a lot of stores, but management also recently raised its store count guidance to 2,400 stores for Ross and 600 for dd's. That implies another ~60% on the store count for Ross and ~150% for dd's. Combined, that means Ross has ~75% upside to its store count from today's levels, providing mid-single-digit revenue growth for many years to come. This is the primary source of growth moving forward, but don't forget about comparable sales growth, which continues to add low-single-digit gains as well. There is also the matter of Ross' capital returns, which continue to grow at impressive rates. \\n\\n Source: Investor presentation, page 19 This chart shows how Ross' total capital returns have grown sizably in recent years as the dividend is being increased at very high rates and share repurchases are as well. Ross produces a lot more cash than it needs to expand the store base and fund the company's operations, so it is boosting its capital returns. Share repurchases are expected to be near $1.1 billion this year, good for ~3% of the float. The dividend yield isn't meaningful at this point, but Ross continues to boost it by leaps and bounds each year. Indeed, this year's increase to the payout was 41% on top of a 19% increase last year, marking the 24th consecutive year of dividend increases. I think Ross will be an income stock one day, but for now, capital returns are focused on reducing the float. This has the benefit of providing additional fuel for earnings growth and, at this stage in the company's lifecycle, that is exactly where it should be focusing its capital returns.\\n A fair valuation for the first time in a while Ross is going for ~18 times next year's earnings estimate of $4.51, so it isn't overly cheap. Indeed, that level of price-to-earnings is about where it has traded for the long term. In recent years, the valuation has drifted higher to the low-20s, and it is entirely possible we'll see that again if comparable sales growth picks up. Even if we don't, however, Ross is poised to deliver double-digit returns from here. I see mid-single-digit growth in revenue from new store openings, a low-single-digit tailwind from comparable sales growth, no impact from margins and a low-single-digit tailwind from share repurchases. In all, it looks quite reasonable to me that Ross should produce ~12% EPS growth annually for the foreseeable future, and given that the valuation is at or near its long-term normalized level, that should produce the same level of returns in the stock. Add in the dividend and you've got a low-double-digit return projection annually, which is a nice place to be for investors that have waited patiently to buy Ross. Indeed, given where the valuation is today and the fact that Ross' growth track still has significant runway, shares look like a buy to me. Investors may not get a chance to own Ross as cheaply as they can today, so for those that want to own it for the long-term, there is no time like the present.\\nDisclosure: I/we have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

Today, let\\'s take a fairly comprehensive look at the major indicators to get a solid idea of where we are. Let\\'s start with the financial markets, beginning with lower-grade credits:\\n\\nCCCs continue to move higher. While they\\'re nowhere near levels from the oil market sell-off of 2015-2016, they are moving higher, which means traders are growing concerned about the financial viability of junk debtors.\\n\\nBaa credit relative to Treasuries is also widening.\\n\\n On the plus side, commercial paper relative to the Fed Funds rate came in sharply recently. \\n\\n\\n The yield curve continues to flatten; it\\'s now below .3%. According to the Fed\\'s latest \"Dot Plot,\" the central bank will continue to tighten a few times next year. And finally, we have the equity market sell-off:\\n\\n Financial indicators conclusion: These are all on a pre-recession footing. Lower-grade credits are widening, and the Treasury curve is flattening. The Fed is still in a tightening mode, while the stock market is selling off. In addition, the Fed\\'s rate hikes are now slowing the housing market:\\n\\n One-unit building permits are softening, although they\\'re still at good levels. Not all the leading indicators are bad, however:\\n\\n New orders for consumer durable goods (top two charts) and capital goods (bottom two charts) are still in pretty good shape. And the two main employment indicators are faring well:\\n\\nManufacturing hours worked (left) are still in good shape, and the four-week moving average of initial unemployment claims (right) is at very low levels.\\n Leading indicators conclusion: The combination of weakening credit market conditions, a declining equity market, a Fed intent on hiking, and softening one-unit building permits keep my recession probability over the next 12-18 months at about 30%. But all the data isn\\'t bad either. There is no sign that the labor market is weakening. In fact, anecdotal comments in the Beige Book and ISM reports indicate businesses are having a difficult time finding employees. And the new orders for capital and consumer durable goods are still strong. Let\\'s turn to the coincidental indicators, starting with the labor market:\\n\\nPayroll employment remains strong. The left chart shows the absolute level, while the right chart shows the Y/Y percentage gain. The right chart has been decreasing, but that\\'s a function of math rather than the market - as the numbers get larger, the percentage increase naturally decreases. Recently, the Y/Y percentage increase has been increasing - a very positive development, especially this far into an expansion. Let\\'s look at this data from a different perspective (data from the FRED system; author\\'s calculations):\\n\\nThe 3=, 6-, and 12-month moving averages are still clustered around the 200,000/month change level. The moving averages help to remove the inherent volatility in this data. The bottom line is the labor market is very strong. Next, let\\'s look at wages:\\n\\n\\n The top two charts use data from the PCE report. This is a bit more comprehensive. It includes dividend and other passive income flow along with proprietors\\' income. This number has been growing at 2% Y/Y for most of 2018. The bottom two charts show hourly wages, which have grown at a faster pace since the beginning of 2018. Overall, these two charts show a strong flow-through of income to consumers. Finally, let\\'s look at industrial production and retail sales:\\n\\nIndustrial production (left) has grown strongly in 2018.

It paid a total of 11.148 million pounds ($14.06 million) for 27.87 million shares at 0.40 pound per share, which represented a premium of 12.8%. The move comes just three months after the world's largest miner BHP (NYSE:BHP) announced that it agreed to buy Guyana Goldfields' (OTCPK:GUYFF) 6.08% stake in SolGold for $35.2 million. As it stands, Newcrest has further increased the gap to BHP's 11.1% stake in SolGold, and I think that a takeover battle for the Ecuadorian company could be on the horizon. What's interesting is that Newcrest bought most of its SolGold shares in 2016 right after the Ecuador-focused company rejected an offer from BHP to buy a 10% interest in it. Newcrest vs. BHP in 2016 In October 2016, BHP offered to acquire 10% of SolGold for $30 million and spent another $275 million for up to 70% of Cascabel. I think that the offer was very generous, but ultimately SolGold decided to reject it as it didn't want to lose control of the project. Newcrest and its financial adviser Maxit offered $33 million for a 14.43% stake and no direct interest in Cascabel. The project Cascabel is located on the northern section of the Andean Copper belt around 180 km north of the capital Quito and is one of the most significant discoveries in the copper and gold sector over the past 10 years. On 20 November, the company presented an updated mineral resource estimate, which more than doubled the project's resource to 15.4 Mt CuEq.\\n \\n\\n Source: SolGold While the grades are not great, the sheer size of Cascabel is astounding. SolGold is targeting a mineral resource of 10 million tonnes of copper and 25 million ounces of gold, and it currently has 12 active rigs on the property. The company has so far completed over 160,000 meters of diamond drilling on Cascabel, and it currently produces around 10,500 meters of core per month. SolGold has been releasing very impressive assays over the past months, and the recent resource update just comes to show you what an amazing potential this project has. Cascabel has produced some of the best drill hole intercepts in porphyry copper-gold exploration history. For example, hole CSD-16-012 returned 1,560m grading 0.59% copper and 0.54 g/t gold. Mining giants have been scrambling to find new copper deposits due to the forecast of a shortage in the red metal emerging in the coming years, and Cascabel is one of the few large new projects that are expected to come online in the near future. According to Colin Hamilton, director of commodities research at BMO Capital Markets, the current copper pipeline is the lowest seen this century, both in terms of number and capacity. There's a preliminary economic assessment underway for the project, so we'll know more about its economics soon. Over the last 12 months, SolGold has been focused on making the resources, particularly the high-grade portion, larger and higher in grade. Ecuador itself has managed to attract a lot of interest from mining companies over the past few years, thanks to a revised regulatory framework and an investor engagement campaign which has already attracted over 400 applications for concessions. BHP or Newcrest for Cascabel?\\n In 2016, one of the reasons SolGold accepted Newcrest's offer was the belief that the latter's experience with block caving at Cadia in New South Wales would make it the ideal partner for Cascabel. Block caving is likely to be required at the project because of its porphyry mineralization and the gold giant is one of the few experienced players in the world. BHP has been stepping up its exploration spending over the past few years with the aim of finding new copper and oil deposits. Copper is one of the group's main businesses, and Cascabel has the potential to become one of its key projects in this space. As a whole, I think that Newcrest is a better fit for Cascabel, thanks to its technical expertise, as block caving is technically difficult and painstaking in its preparation. While the separate share purchases by BHP and Newcrest point to a looming bidding war, I think that it could be in the best interest of both companies to work together on this project. Cascabel will undoubtedly be very large and require substantial initial capex and BHP doesn't have much experience in block caving. Also, Newcrest mentioned at its strategy day that it isn't averse to looking at or developing mines in joint ventures. The company is already partnering with Harmony Gold (HMY) for the development of the giant Wafi Golpu gold project in Papua New Guinea. Even if a bidding war doesn't materialize, I still view SolGold as very undervalued as evidenced by the premiums that both BHP and Newcrest are willing to pay to increase their stakes over the past few months. Also, consider this - Newcrest's 2016 offer valued SolGold at around $230 million, while the latest purchase put the company's valuation at over $900 million.\\nIf you like this article, consider joining The Gold Commonwealth.\\nThere's a two-week free trial and the service will focus on long ideas, takeover targets, turnarounds, exploration stories and under-followed gems in the mining space, particularly gold.

Three-month LIBOR was fixed yesterday at a fraction higher than 2.80%, meaning that if it stays around or above that level someone is losing money on it. The futures price isn't directly translatable but back-of-the-envelope it works out to an expectation for 3-month LIBOR on that date in March to be less than what it is fixed now. In other words, the market is seriously betting LIBOR is coming down not two years from now but in the short run. That expectation only grows the further out in time (down the curve). Inversion, as noted earlier today, had been limited to more distant years centered around 2020. The eurodollar curve now sports inversion from the front month all the way out to September 2020.

In doing so, many are also looking at their diversification and risk characteristics of their portfolio. There are some investments that provide the characteristics income investors are looking for. This is one of them. Company Overview Digital Realty Trust, Inc. (DLR) owns, acquires, repositions, and manages technology-related real estate. The company\\'s properties contain applications and operations critical to the day-to-day operations of technology industry tenants and corporate enterprise datacenter tenants. As of September 30, 2018, DLR\\'s portfolio included 198 datacenters, including 18 datacenters in unconsolidated joint ventures, with approximately 33.4 million rentable square feet including approximately 3.6 million square feet of space under active development and approximately 1.8 million square feet of space held for development. DLR also owns 24 parcels of developable land, which is approximately 527 acres. At September 30, 2018, approximately 3.6 million square feet was under construction for Turn-Key Flex and Powered Base Building products, all of which are expected to be income producing on or after completion, in seven U.S. metropolitan areas, four European metropolitan areas, three Asian metropolitan areas, two Australian metropolitan areas, and one Canadian metropolitan area, consisting of approximately 2.0 million square feet of base building construction and 1.6 million square feet of datacenter construction.\\n Financial Snapshot The following table provides a snapshot of Digital Realty\\'s financials. As the table shows, the REIT has grown significantly over the last five years, and significantly in 2017 when it purchased DuPont Fabros (\"DFT\"). While the payout ratio and debt as a percentage of capital (with equity at book) are moderate, leverage versus EBITDA (debt/EBITDA) is high at 7x, but the company has been delevering since the acquisition of DFT and should bring it below 7x in order to maintain its financial profile and ratings. \\n\\n Source: Author spreadsheet Debt is evenly distributed and should not pose an issue absent systemic market issues or a significant downturn in the REIT\\'s profile - neither of which are visible currently. \\n\\n Source: Author spreadsheet Investment Conundrum DLR has outperformed the broader REIT market by a very healthy margin (shown below over three years), which has attracted both growth and income money as the datacenter space has followed tech names up (think of the FANG clients). Recently, however, the sell-off in the FANG names has also affected the datacenter space and added volatility to DLR\\'s price. REIT investors, often income focused, do not tend to like additional volatility. \\n\\nDLR data by YCharts\\n One of the attractive aspects of the REIT space is the dividends it provides for investors (which is required for a REIT). DLR however no longer yields as much as the broader REIT market given its increased price. Five years: \\n\\nDLR Dividend Yield (TTM) data by YCharts Three years: \\n\\nDLR Dividend Yield (TTM) data by YCharts Interestingly, however, on a real-rate basis (yield minus the breakeven inflation rate from five-year TIPS), the yield on DLR is more attractive than it has been in two years: \\n\\n Source: Author spreadsheet The lower yield, while the result of growth/higher prices, is not always aligned with a REIT investor\\'s objectives. While this may preclude some investors from having exposure to the datacenter space, there is another way to add exposure to the datacenter space while adding income to your portfolio. Investment Solution Preferred stock. While preferred stocks on average will not significantly contribute to the growth in an investor\\'s portfolio, they can provide an investor with a steady stream of income. Digital Realty has five outstanding preferred stock issues. While they will not have the potential upside of the equity, DLR preferred stocks can help diversify an income-focused portfolio without sacrificing quality (DLR is Baa2 rated at the senior unsecured level, and Baa3 at the preferred level).\\n The five outstanding issues consist of the following: \\n\\n Source: Author spreadsheet The preferred complex has the following price/market characteristics: \\n\\n Source: Author spreadsheet Of the above issues, my choice is the 5.25% Series J Preferred (DLR.PJ) due to the extended call protection, attractive stripped yield, and low dollar price. It must be stated, however, that the Series J has the lowest stated rate in the DLR preferred complex, which increases the duration risk versus the others. That said, I believe this risk is somewhat mitigated due to the direction of rates and the expectation for inflation (controlled) and growth (moderate). If duration is a concern, I would look at the Series I (DLR.PI) as it has a higher stated rate and a price below par (as this is a constraint that many self-impose). Stripped yield (graphically): \\n\\n Source: Author spreadsheet Yield-to-call (graphically): \\n\\n\\n Source: Author spreadsheet The DLRpJ is trading near its wides versus the other 2017 issue, the DLRpC (DLR.PC): \\n\\n Source: Author spreadsheet Of course, an investor has many options when it comes to preferreds. The table below lists preferred stocks of similar REITs (by sector and rating) as well as newly issued preferreds. \\n\\n Source: Author spreadsheet Among the peers that have a similar rating and credit profile, the DLRpJ is attractive. Compared to the lower rated and more volatile REITs, it is obviously less attractive. As the goal was to produce yield while controlling volatility and maintaining credit quality, I believe that the Digital Realty Series J meets these criteria and is attractive versus peers. I also believe that the more volatile/higher-risk names can be effectively used in a portfolio if sized appropriately. Graphically, the stripped yield: \\n\\n Source: Author spreadsheet Graphically, the yield-to-call: \\n\\n\\n Source: Author spreadsheet Compared to the peer group, the DLRpJ has an attractive spread to the equity dividend yield, which compensates investors for the cap on potential upside: \\n\\n Source: Author spreadsheet Shown graphically: \\n\\n Source: Author spreadsheet The following chart shows where the securities fall within the equity REIT (no mortgage REITs) preferred universe (115 issues): \\n\\n Source: Author spreadsheet While there are obviously a decent number of REIT preferreds at a lower dollar price and/or a higher yield, I believe that the Digital Realty Series J Preferred is attractive versus peers (when the goal is considered) and should be considered by income investors who want to diversify their portfolio. As a result, I am assigning the DLRpJ a BUY rating with a NEUTRAL weighting.

In other words, do they follow their advice and own shares in the company they are writing about? In the case of B&G Foods (BGS), I do eat my own cooking. In fact, I have been eating its products for as long as I can remember - only I had no idea that those products would become part of B&G\\'s portfolio of brands. More than half a century ago, I would pour Vermont Maid syrup on pancakes or waffles. Or, on other cold mornings, there would be hot Cream of Wheat cereal. There was Ac\\'cent on the spice rack and Green Giant canned vegetables in the cupboard. I also remember watching television ads for its food and non-food products like Underwood and Static Guard - products that never made it into our home. In fact, B&G also has many other well-known, and lesser-known, brands that our family currently buys, including Victoria pasta sauce, Sclafani tomatoes, Ortega Salsa, Polaner jellies and jams, B&M baked beans and B&G relish. Let\\'s be clear about several points. First, B&G wasn\\'t manufacturing and distributing many of those brands when I was a kid. Second, B&G didn\\'t create most of the brands listed above. Third, the company has grown from $544 million in sales in 2011 to a projected $1.7 billion in sales in 2018 by purchasing brands from other companies. Fourth, the dividend has grown from an annual rate of $.84 at the start of 2011 (the first year I recommended B&G in an article on Seeking Alpha) to $1.90 at the end of this year, an increase of 126%. Fifth, the increases in the dividend have been driven by more than a dozen accretive acquisitions during that time period. Acquisitions are a critical part of the B&G growth story and the foundation of its business strategy. The company notes that it has...    ...been built upon a successful track record of acquisition-driven growth. Our goal is to continue to increase sales, profitability and cash flows through strategic acquisitions, new product development and organic growth. We intend to implement our growth strategy through the following initiatives: expanding our brand portfolio with disciplined acquisitions of complementary branded businesses, continuing to develop new products and delivering them to market quickly, leveraging our multiple channel sales and distribution system and continuing to focus on higher growth customers and distribution channels. Since 1996, we have successfully acquired and integrated more than 45 brands into our company. Most recently, on July 16, 2018, we acquired the McCann\\'s brand of premium Irish oatmeal from TreeHouse Foods, Inc. On October 2, 2017, we completed the acquisition of Back to Nature Foods Company, LLC and related entities from Brynwood Partners VI L.P., Mondelēz International and certain other sellers. We refer to these acquisitions in this report as the \"McCann\\'s acquisition\" and the \"Back to Nature acquisition,\" respectively. \\n Furthermore, the company has a stated dividend policy that focuses on shareholders: Our dividend policy reflects a basic judgment that our stockholders are better served when we distribute a substantial portion of our cash available to pay dividends to them instead of retaining it in our business. Under this policy, a substantial portion of the cash generated by our company in excess of operating needs, interest and principal payments on indebtedness, capital expenditures sufficient to maintain our properties and other assets is distributed as regular quarterly cash dividends to the holders of our common stock and not retained by us. We have paid dividends every quarter since our initial public offering in October 2004. The company makes accretive acquisitions where approximately half the incremental revenue is turned into EBITDA and half of that EBITDA becomes free cash flow. Then, approximately half of that free cash flow goes to shareholders in the form of increased dividends. So, what\\'s the issue? The company\\'s dividend, and more importantly, the growth of that dividend, are tied closely to its accretive acquisitions. The only acquisition in 2018 was a small ($31 million) purchase of McCann\\'s Irish Oatmeal. With only about $19 million of revenue from McCann\\'s, EBITDA and any incremental FCF are likely to be quite small. Even worse, in 2018 the company also sold its 5th largest brand, Pirate\\'s Booty, to Hershey (HSY) for $420 million. Why write \"even worse\"? Because if the dividend growth is dependent on acquisition-fueled top-line growth, B&G has taken a step backwards in 2018! Don\\'t misunderstand. Selling a brand that it purchased for $195 million five years earlier for more than twice what it cost isn\\'t all bad, but it does leave a hole (according to my guesstimates) of approximately 7 cents per share in the funding of B&G\\'s $1.90 annual dividend. The Pirate\\'s sale press release noted the following: B&G Foods intends to use the net proceeds from the sale for the repayment of long-term debt and possible acquisitions.\\n And Cantwell reiterated the point about acquisitions with the following quote: One of my biggest goals as CEO has been to ensure that B&G Foods remains ready and able to continue our acquisition strategy. By selling Pirate Brands at a very attractive multiple and using the net proceeds to reduce long-term debt, we will significantly reduce our leverage, which positions us very well for future acquisitions. Cantwell doesn\\'t appear to have been in a rush to replace the loss of Pirate\\'s free cash flow, and that could be a plus, demonstrating a new-found fiscal restraint. Or it could be an indication that other packaged food companies are unwilling to part with some of their orphan brands at a reasonable multiple. In any event, as 2018 draws to a close, this may be remembered as the year where B&G chalked up a net negative score on its acquisitions. Perhaps time will tell if it was the correct decision. Eating My Own Cooking In the meantime, I remain long due to the attractive dividend yield. In fact, because B&G has held up very well during the recent downturn, my portfolio now shows that I have a slightly overweight position in B&G. I also have covered calls with strike prices ranging from $32.50 to $40 written against nearly two thirds of my position. These calls serve several purposes. First, they reduce my net cash invested in B&G. Second, they serve to increase the net yield on that investment. Third, and most important for me, as the price climbs and the yield drops, I will automatically take profits. Although I like B&G and its dividend, I hope not to get too much indigestion if the price suddenly drops back to the $22 it touched last spring. And, if the price continues to rise, my asset allocation will automatically be realigned as some of those calls are exercised.\\nDisclosure: I am/we are long BGS.

(NFLX)</a></span>'], 'theme': ['<div class=\"a-themes\"></div>'], 'summary': ['Netflix has always been built around innovation, but sometimes its politics and policies seem to get in the way of showcasing its many accomplishments to potential and current investors.This week, the service debuted the first self-contained streaming choose-your-own-adventure style program for mainstream audiences through its award-winning series \"Black Mirror\".Entitled \"Bandersnatch,\" the drama\\'s branching storylines was another step forward in what sets Netflix apart from its rivals and serves a timely reminder about the company\\'s level of innovation.While there are still elements of Netflix that can be of concern to investors in the long run, being able to roll out this type of programming and technology speaks volumes.'], 'article': ['\\n\\n Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) has long been a company built around innovation. Few can argue that, but many can argue that somewhere along the way that innovation took a turn. Instead of just doing what was ground-breaking and inventive for the industry, it at times became more about forcing a square peg into a round hole. For lack of a better word, Netflix has come across very stubborn in key areas where it wasn\\'t having the same level of success (i.e., films) and very obstinate in areas that analysts see as problematic (i.e., over-spending). Instead of trying to find a way around the walls being thrown up at it, it kept trying to go through them. And, of course, as the old expression goes - the first one through the wall is the bloodiest. Except Netflix has largely been unable to break those walls, but in 2019, it is setting up fresh attempts - though that\\'s a story for 2019. Why I bring this up now though is because at its heart Netflix has always had the ability to change the game in some fairly stunning ways, and investors should never forget that fact.\\n Enter Black Mirror - Bandersnatch Over the last few years, Black Mirror has become a cult classic with the media and pop culture audiences. An anthology series with futuristic elements, the drama has a new (often star-studded) cast for every episode. In many cases, the episodes are out there in extreme ways and that can easily scare off viewers (pro tip - if you choose to watch the series, don\\'t start with episode one). The point though is that like most of Netflix\\'s programming, Black Mirror is different, innovative and something works really well on a streaming service. This week, Netflix used Black Mirror to introduce a new tool it\\'s been working on to enhance the viewing experience for its subscribers. Bandersnatch is the first truly interactive mainstream program that utilizes a \"choose-your-own-adventure\" approach to storytelling. You as the viewer control the action through on-screen prompts to lead to one of five endings. In total it is supposed to take around 90 minutes per viewing, but reportedly it could go as long as a full hour longer. In addition to choosing to utilize the technology, Netflix also smartly picked its point for when to announce its availability. The service gave audiences about a day\\'s notice it was coming and only gave them a brief trailer to chew on in the run-up. In terms of plot, Bandersnatch goes a little meta as it follows a programmer working on a choose-your-own-adventure game and centers on the physiological toll it takes on him. Again, like the technology the decision to limit the information ahead of time was a calculated risk designed to give the product a chance to succeed. In an interview with The Hollywood Reporter, Netflix\\'s Director of Product Innovation, Carla Engelbrecht, elaborated on the rationale. \"People have never seen this before, so they could come to it with preconceived notions, especially if they think this is a video game or a heavy definition of what interactive is. We think the enormous delight that will happen is powerful - as soon as folks find out that it\\'s an interactive Black Mirror episode, their heads explode.\"\\n And she\\'s right. This is exactly the type of enhancement the public needs to see to understand, as reading about it and experiencing it are two entirely different things. Either way at the end of the day, the idea is ground-breaking, and credit goes to Netflix for both the approach and execution. Frequent readers and subscribers of my column know I\\'m not always bullish on Netflix. A lot of my reservations stem from concerns that some of the company\\'s unwavering obsessions and strategies could end up hurting investors in the long run. Nothing stays on top forever - we\\'ve seen that time and time again, and Netflix in effect proved that in its rise to the top. However, what keeps a company fresh and in the proverbial cat-bird seat is doing something that makes it stand out. Bandersnatch is that stand-out element that reminds audiences what Netflix is able to accomplish when it goes back to its roots. It doesn\\'t have to be the most amazing storytelling ever or have the most grounded plot, it just has to do enough to move the industry forward, and this does that in spades. This isn\\'t the first attempt by a network to use branching technology, but it is the first to make it so easily accessible to audiences. HBO\\'s attempt last year with Mosaic had a far more recognizable cast and crew (including Steven Soderbergh and Sharon Stone), but failed to catch on as widespread because it required the user to download an app to view the way it was intended. Audiences aren\\'t ready for that, they want convenience, and Netflix has always been about convenience. While I still have fears about Netflix\\'s inability to be flexible on some of its key tenants, it is these types of activations that show why it can afford to be as steadfast in its resolve. Bandersnatch is another feather in the cap of Netflix in terms of offering something different and in a way special, but more importantly to investors it is a reminder the company is still in touch with its early beginnings even if sometimes it doesn\\'t seem like that is the case.\\n\\nDisclosure: I/we have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

Nevertheless, the developed market is still outperforming the global developed ex-U.S. equities benchmark, and it is less expensive. BlackRock, though, maintains a neutral outlook on this country. Nevertheless, Japan does show some solid fundamentals. Specifically, the weaker yen, strong corporate fundamentals, bargain valuations, and central bank buying are all positives. Furthermore, Japan\\'s political temperature is relatively stable. \"We expect the Bank of Japan (BoJ) to remain accommodative, however any changes could lead to yen appreciation and further undercut export growth,\" according to BlackRock.

That said, though, Chesapeake has sold non-core assets and paid down debt in an effort to transform the oil and natural gas driller into a more cost-efficient, less levered energy company. The most recent acquisition in October is set to drive cost savings. Shares are very attractively priced on the drop, and the risk/reward has further improved. Market Sell-Off Provides Entry Opportunity Chesapeake Energy's shares have dropped to a new 52-week low in December @$1.71 as crude oil prices plunged to an 18-month low. Though the company is no longer oversold according to the Relative Strength Index, or RSI, the drop still opens up another buying window for investors who want to speculate on a technical rebound. \\n\\n Source: StockCharts The driving force behind Chesapeake's falling share price was growing investor concerns over slowing global economic growth, which has hurt investor sentiment badly in the fourth quarter. The Fed also contributed to investor anxiety by guiding for two more interest rate hikes next year, though the central bank scaled back its interest rate path.\\n Energy companies such as Chesapeake Energy are directional bets on higher price realizations, first and foremost. The higher prices for oil and natural gas climb, the bigger the earnings impact, and the bigger the valuation upside. With energy prices retreating since October, Chesapeake has also taken a hit. Prices for WTI crude oil, for instance, have dropped below $50/barrel lately. \\n\\nWTI Crude Oil Spot Price data by YCharts Latest Transaction On October 30, 2018, Chesapeake Energy announced that it was acquiring Texas-based WildHorse Resource Development Corporation (NYSE:WRD) in a stock-and-cash deal worth $3.98 billion. The deal was set to boost Chesapeake's oil production in the attractive Eagle Ford shale and have a positive effect on the company's operating costs. Management estimated that the deal would translate into $200-280 million in average annual savings, totaling $1 to $1.5 billion by 2023. \\n\\n Source: Chesapeake Energy Corp. Investor Presentation The oil and natural gas producer expects to improve its oil mix and grow its adjusted oil production from ~80,000 barrels/day to ~165,000 barrels/day by 2020. The acquired assets fit well into Chesapeake's increasingly oil-heavy development portfolio. \\n\\n\\n Source: Chesapeake Energy Corp. The acquisition came shortly after the oil and natural gas driller sold its Utica shale assets for $2.0 billion to Encino Acquisition Partners earlier this year. The company said at the time that it would use the proceeds to further its deleveraging efforts. Chesapeake Energy Corp. Is Dirt Cheap The good news, however, is that Chesapeake's shares have become really affordable on the sell-off. Shares today sell for an almost unbelievably low earnings multiple: Investors today pay just three times next year's estimated earnings for CHK's shares. Shares have historically traded at much higher earnings multiple. The risk of overpaying for CHK at this valuation point is very low, in my opinion. \\n\\nCHK PE Ratio (Forward 1y) data by YCharts And here's how Chesapeake compares against similar companies in the sector in terms of forward P/E ratio. \\n\\nCHK PE Ratio (Forward 1y) data by YCharts In terms of price-to-sales ratio, the valuation also has become a lot more compelling lately. \\n\\nCHK PS Ratio (Forward 1y) data by YCharts Risk Factors Investors Need To Consider An economic downturn paired with a decline in price realizations would be a major negative for the investment thesis and most likely cap Chesapeake Energy's upside potential. Uncertainty in the market with respect to the U.S. government shutdown and the U.S.-China trade stalemate will also continue to weigh on investor sentiment. On the other hand, the U.S. economy is still growing and Chesapeake survived the last brutal energy downmarket from 2014-2016. Hence, the company deserves the benefit of the doubt.\\n Your Takeaway Chesapeake is very attractively valued on the sell-off. Investor concerns over an economic slowdown and rate hikes next year are a bit exaggerated, in my opinion, which potentially provides investors with an above-average risk tolerance with an entry opportunity into Chesapeake Energy. CHK has fallen too far too fast, in my opinion, and the risk of overpaying for the company's shares at just 3.1x next year's estimated earnings is limited.

Concerns about the investments made into cannabis, which adds significantly to leverage, as well as a natural correction in response to a very big momentum run (and hence premium valuation) mean that valuations now look more appealing. While the stock looks tempting, given the recent underperformance, I recognise that bargains are showing up left and right in this market, making me a patient buyer at $150 per share. A Growing \"Pleasure\" Giant Constellation has rather rapidly become a giant as it has grown to become a premium beer and wine brand with over $7.5 billion in sales in the fiscal year of 2018 (excluding excise taxes of course). The success has been induced by a very smart deal to dominate the \"Mexican\" beer category with Corona among others, as that deal has been a driving force behind shares having risen from just $10 in 2009, to a high around $235 in April of this year. While the $4.7 billion beer business has been given the credits for the success, note that the company has a solid wine business as well, generating nearly $2.9 billion in revenues last year. Last year, the company reported net earnings of $2.4 billion, for very fat margins, although aided by tax reform. Deal-making efforts and other efforts to please investors have saddled with company with quite some debt. In fact, it operated with a net debt load of $10.1 billion at the end of last year. With EBITDA running at $2.8 billion a year, the balance sheet was quite leveraged at a 3.6 time leverage multiple, although beer brands are quite stable, and underlying growth allows for this kind of leverage. It should furthermore be said that Constellation has seen solid growth with even higher relative ratios in the past few years.\\n What is true is that valuations were not cheap at roughly 22-23 times reported earnings in spring of this year, given the leverage, with overall comparable growth of 3% being decent, but no longer being that impressive. Furthermore, part of the earnings reported were inflated by tax reform. Adjusted earnings totalled $8.72 per share in the fiscal year of 2018, representing a 27 times earnings multiple at the peak of $235 per share. Moving Into Cannabis - Other 2018 Developments Upon the release of the fiscal year of 2018 results, Constellation announced a 9.9% stake in Canadian cannabis producer Canopy (OTC:CGC) for $191 million, creating a first mover advantage in what could become the next large consumer category. The rationale behind the deal was that the illicit US market alone already represents a $50 billion opportunity, being almost equally as large as wine and spirits. In June, the company reported a solid start to the fiscal year of 2019, with first quarter comparable sales growth numbers up 6%, as the big news came in August. Halfway during the month, the company announced that it has increased its stake in Canopy to 38%, this time requiring a $4 billion investment. The company acquired 104.5 million shares at CAD 48.60. To be more precise, the big funds should ensure that Canopy and Constellation as majority owner (in the future) stand to benefit from this growth. Shares of Canopy quickly rose to nearly CAD 70 in the wake of the deal but now trade at CAD 36, implying about billion has gone up in smoke (at least in terms of the valuation). So far, it is only Altria (MO) to a large extent making a similar large bet on cannabis to date. Second quarter comparable sales growth was solid at 10% as the company increased the adjusted earnings guidance to $9.60-9.75 per share, but that is before considering the $4 billion investment in Canopy, which will be dilutive at first (of course). Besides the cannabis craze losing momentum, investors furthermore had to digest the news that CEO Rob Sands will be leaving the company in spring of 2019. While net debt was cut to $9.7 billion by the end of Q2, the investment in Canopy will still increase this net debt load to $13.7 billion on a proforma basis, thereby increasing leverage to nearly 5 times again!\\n Appeal Lures The good news is that earnings are seen at $9.60-9.75 per share currently, which combined with a 25% setback in the stock has reduced the multiple to 17 times earnings again, driven by overall correction in the market, doubts about the Canopy deal and change in leadership, as well as correction of the strong momentum seen before. Furthermore, note that additional interest in relation to the Canopy deal is not yet accounted for. Assuming 5% cost of debt on a $4 billion investment which generates zero EBIT at the start, that reduces earnings power by about a dollar on a pre-tax basis. This makes that earnings multiples, including the Canopy deal, probably come in closer to 19 times again, as leverage is very high at 4.5-5.0 times currently. Fortunately, Canopy has real growth ahead of itself, as the core business of Constellation shows healthy (sales) growth in the mid single-digits, creating growing earnings streams to support this leverage position. Consequently, I like the improved multiples at which the shares trade, but trading at a slight premium to the market, while operating with so much leverage and operating margins being very high already, there are reasons to not be too upbeat just yet. On the other hand, Constellation has rapidly built up a reputation for growth and willingness to move early into new markets. For now, I am not just pulling the trigger, with other parts of the market seeing some turmoil as well, although I would be willing to slowly buy further dips towards the $150 mark.\\nPlease subscribe to Value In Corporate Events - Marketplace Checkout to obtain premium research on all the latest IPOs, M&A activity and other corporate events.

Bernstein & Company Analysts (January 2017) Bull markets are born on pessimism, grow on skepticism, mature on optimism, and die on euphoria\" Sir John Templeton Life and investing are long ballgames.\" Julian Robertson \\n\\n (Source: Authors Photo): Introduction In an investment age where passive investing, ETF investing, DGI investing, momentum investing, and trend following investing rule the roost, so to speak, and sentiment is viewed as potentially the most important determining factor for investment decisions, it has become popular to ignore, or even deride fundamentals, which has caused something remarkable to happen. Specifically, we have the most fundamentally bifurcated market than I have ever seen in my 25 plus years of actively speculating and investing, as there are more simultaneously historically cheap firms, and historically expensive firms, both occurring at the same time, than I can ever remember, creating what should be a dream environment for the few remaining fundamental stock pickers. Investment Thesis Underlying cash flows, future discounted cash flows, and the present and future values of balance sheets are what drive business values, and ultimately stocks prices. Since almost all have abandoned this approach, following momentum strategies or various technical strategies, the opportunity is extraordinary for those that practice the traditional lost art of security analysis.\\n The Expensive Side Of The Market Like a boat that has a leak, which will eventually sink the ship if it is not dealt with, fundamentals can only be ignored for a certain amount of time, though admittedly this time period can stretch on for years on end. I have written extensively publicly, and much more privately for my premium research service, on what I believe is cheap today (and there are opportunities today on the long side that rival the best opportunities in late 2008 and early 2009 from my perspective), including in-depth analysis of fundamentally attractive, out-of-favor, non-index favorite equities like Cleveland-Cliffs (CLF), and Chesapeake Energy (CHK), which is currently exhibiting a series of positive technical and price divergences, adding to the valuation case I made in late October of 2018 comparing Chesapeake to Oklahoma City peer Devon Energy (DVN), which I also believe is an undervalued equity today. For a refresher, here was the elevator pitch valuation comparison for CHK posted in my October 31st article.   What type of multiple could Chesapeake Energy trade at? I think its fellow Oklahoma City headquartered peer company, Devon Energy (DVN) is a good comparison. Actually, let me restate that. I think DVN is a really good comparison. Why? CHK in 2020 could look very much like DVN today. Today, DVN trades for roughly 9 times EV/EBITDA value, which I think is a low valuation for DVN, and an enterprise value of roughly $26 billion. Applying a similar multiple to CHK for 2020\\'s EBITDA suggests an enterprise value for CHK of roughly $25 billion, minus the net debt of $8 billion, minus roughly $2 billion in preferred equity (rounding up for the debt and preferred equity), which leaves roughly $15 billion for equity holders. Post-deal, where CHK shareholders are estimated to own 55% of the equity, and WRD shareholders are estimated to own 45% of the equity, with 913 million shares outstanding today, there will be roughly 1.65 billion shares outstanding post-acquisition, implying a $9 per share value on a 9 multiple of 2020 EBITDA. With a stock price of close of $3.27 today, that is upside potential of roughly 175% for CHK shares over the next 18 months (with the recent declines the value proposition for both CHK and DVN have improved from my perspective). \\n Now you may, or you may not agree with my analysis, and you may, or you may not agree with my future assumptions. However, there are compelling fundamental reasons why CLF, CHK, and even DVN are cheap equities, and these attractive fundamental characteristics should exhibit an upward gravitational pull on the respective equity prices of the fundamentally undervalued securities. After all, Warren Buffett has used the famous Benjamin Graham quote often, which was the following: \"In the short run, the market is a voting machine but in the long run, it is a weighing machine.\" To quantify these fundamentals, I have been building proprietary valuation tools, including intrinsic values derived from discounted cash flow models, and a quantitative valuation comparative matrix for members of The Contrarian. As part of this analysis, we have analyzed well over 100 companies, including many favorites in today\\'s market environment, and results are eye-opening. The following is a small excerpted sample, with member-only features like the intrinsic value price targets missing. \\n\\n(Source: The Contrarian) For the table above, CHK\\'s metrics are adjusted for the upcoming acquisition of WildHorse (WRD), which has not closed yet. Even with important member only fields missing, the raw valuation metrics illustrate my point that the above mentioned equities are cheap relative to the broader equity market, particularly on a EV/EBITDA basis, and on an Operating Cash Flow to Enterprise Value Yield basis. Conversely, what are the expensive equities in today\\'s market environment? Here is a sample of what is expensive from my view of companies I cover in The Contrarian. \\n\\n(Source: The Contrarian)\\n The table above of overvalued equities, in my opinion, includes companies that I have covered in-depth as an analyst, and features Diamondback (FANG), JPMorgan Chase (JPM), LTC Properties (LTC), Procter & Gamble (PG), Coca-Cola (KO), W.P. Carey (WPC), American Tower (AMT), American Campus (ACC), Realty Income (O), Store Capital (STOR), McDonald\\'s (MCD), Regency Centers (REG), Simon Property (SPG), Kimco Realty (KIM), Tanger (SKT), Omega Healthcare (OHI), Amazon (AMZN), and Netflix (NFLX). Collectively, these equities are a sub-sector of the very popular equities in the market today, specifically large-cap favorites like McDonald\\'s, Coca-Cola, and Procter & Gamble, growth favorites like Amazon, and Netflix, and a host or REITs. What is one thing that is a commonality between these equities besides that they are popular (remember the Benjamin Graham quote above), and they have generally been strong equity performers in the current bull market? Any guesses? If you said overvaluation, or very high valuations, you got the answer right. Honing in on a comparison, look at the EV/EBITDA ratios of the above highlighted firms, and the Operating Cash Flow to Enterprise Yields, and compare them to the three undervalued firms I highlighted earlier. Do you see the valuation difference? Now, remember the Benjamin Graham quote from earlier. \"In the short run, the market is a voting machine but in the long run, it is a weighing machine.\" Closing Thoughts Fundamentals matter. They do today, even though it does not seem like it, after a roughly decade long bull market that has largely detached from fundamentals, temporarily, in my opinion, like the last decade of growth over value dominance from 1990-2000, and they have mattered historically, as equities have a high correlation to simple fundamental criteria. Personally, I have been involved as an active speculator and investor for the past 25 years, I have been involved as a professional investor and analyst for over 20 years, and I have studied market history more than almost anyone I know, and I can say that the last time we had such a divergence between fundamentals and securities prices was the late 1990s culminating in late 1999, and early 2000, famously captured by Julian Robertson in his March 2000 letter to Tiger investors, with this quote ringing true today.\\n   And what do I mean by, \"there is no quick end in sight?\" What is \"end\" the end of? \"End\" is the end of the bear market in value stocks. It is the recognition that equities with cash-on-cash returns of 15 to 25 percent, regardless of their short-term market performance, are great investments. \"End\" in this case means a beginning by investors overall to put aside momentum and potential short-term gain in highly speculative stocks to take the more assured, yet still historically high returns available in out-of-favor equities. Julian Robertson March 2000  Julian Robertson famously closed his value focused hedge fund in early 2000, right before the historic inflection point where capital finally shifted back to value, with value equities massively outperforming their growth counterparts from 2000 to 2002, and we might be on the cusp of something similar right now, with the apparent capitulation in value equities to close the fourth quarter of 2018, as a number of institutional and retail investors are redeeming shares with no regard to valuation. Interestingly, while both October of 2018, and December of 2018 have been very difficult months for the broader equity market, leading to one of the worst periods of 4th quarter equity market performance in the stock markets history, I believe the heightened volatility is simply a prelude to a return to normal, as investors are being weaned off of unprecedented central bank generosity the past decade. Ultimately, fundamentals still do matter, and price discovery will eventually return with a vengeance to a market that has lacked any semblance of price discovery for a majority of the duration of the current equity bull market, as passive and ETF fund flows have combined with momentum and trend following strategies to form a pool of capital that has largely been indiscriminate buyers and indiscriminate sellers. While we are just embarking on this journey, we are nowhere near being there yet, and we have a long way to go to rediscover price discovery.\\n To close, even though it has been a very difficult stretch for value-oriented investors, I think we are about to enter a golden age for active value investors who do the fundamental work, who can find the best value stocks today, and the most out-of-favor sectors, and the most out-of-favor equities will be at the forefront of this opportunity.\\nThe Contrarian.

I shall not argue with that. However, in my original column stating that America cannot win the trade war, I really meant that America cannot become better off from the trade war. As a matter of fact, America has derived much benefit from trading with China over the years. The huge trade deficit with China hides the fact that America has actually exported to the Chinese market much more than what is shown in the trade account. If the sales of GM cars and i-phones and other American brands from the factories of China are counted, it is very clear that the export of American output content is much bigger than the international trade figures indicate. Moreover, if the intermediate good content of non-China producers are subtracted from China\\'s exports to the US, then the trade deficit with China becomes a fraction of the reported figures. As a percentage of the American GDP averaged about 2.9% for the last 7 quarters. On the other hand the current account deficit is much smaller, only about 2.3%. The following Table is compiled from Survey of Current Business from the Bureau of Economic Analysis, December 2018.   Seasonally adjusted Seasonally adjusted    2017 2018    I II  III IV  I II  III  Balance on current account ($m)  -107,709 -121,837 -103,447 -116,148 -121,710 -101,224 -124,817  Balance on goods and services ($m)  -134,959 -136,700 -132,791 -147,826 -153,989 -134,606 -158,656  GDP($b) Annual Rate  19162.6 19359.1 19588.1 19831.8 20041 20411.9 20658.2  Current account% of GDP (average of 7 quarters = -2.3%)  -2.24832 -2.51741 -2.11245 -2.34266 -2.42922 -1.98363 -2.4168  Trade account % of GDP (average of 7 quarters = -2.9%)  -2.81713 -2.82451 -2.71167 -2.9816 -3.07348 -2.63779 -3.07202   This suggests that America is reaping huge gains from its overseas investment, including investment in China. China is a huge market, and America is selling to the Chinese market via its factories located there. America is also buying from China many US brand products with American value added. Thus the focus on the trade deficit with China is really misplaced. As I have explained in my article, a tariff on Chinese products is a tariff on China\\'s international suppliers too. Thus it will hurt other suppliers just as it hurts China. The author agrees with me that the two countries will go back to the negotiating table. As China is very pragmatic, China certainly does not want a long drawn out trade war, which will hurt everybody. China will certainly make various concessions, so that Trump can tell Americans happily that he has won the trade war. But China is actually opening up no matter what. Opening up is a declared policy stance. China has also been working hard on protecting intellectual property rights, and over the last 15 years has increased its payment for the use of IPR that it uses in its production by 10 times. China has also just announced new laws protecting IPR.  Moreover, it should be noted that an American think tank rates China relatively high among developing countries in protection of IPR. The US Chamber of Commerce International IP Index for China stands at 19.08 out of 40, which is higher than India\\'s 12.03 and Russia\\'s 17.09, and not much lower than that of Costa Rica, a US territory. Over the years China\\'s IPR protection has steadily improved, and that is a fact.  We need to take a historical perspective, in order to assess China\\'s progress. In the early 1980s, India\\'s nominal GDP per capita was roughly the same as that of China and in PPP terms India\\'s per capita GDP was roughly twice that of China. Today, however, China is a better citizen in IP protection than India by far. Why is Trump\\'s criticisms of intellectual property theft not targeted against India but against China? \\n Taking a historical perspective, China\\'s current account surplus today is a mere 1.35%(2017), as compared to 1.69% in year 2000. So its current account surplus is not only tiny, but also smaller than it was before it became a WTO member in 2001. During the same period, Germany\\'s current account balance turned from a deficit of 1.73%(2000) to a surplus of 8.08 per cent of the GDP(2017). Why is President Trump not complaining against Germany\\'s mercantilistic practices? China will let America \"win the trade war\" because that is what Trump wants, in the sense of making various concessions. Perhaps surprising to most readers, the American trade deficit as a percentage of the GDP has actually narrowed since China acceded to the WTO in 2000. Although the trade deficit did rise from 3.65% in 2000 to 5.56% in 2006, it had fallen to 2.8% by 2016. But since Trump became president in Jan 2017, the trade deficit had widened to 3.1% by Q3 2018. This has everything to do with the increase in the fiscal deficit under his administration but nothing with China misbehaving. Until the fiscal deficit falls, it is difficult to see how the trade war will end up narrowing the trade deficit. In that sense, I still insist that the US cannot win the trade war.\\nDisclosure: I/we have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

In other words \"shrink to grow.\"ConocoPhillips has showed them how: Upgrade the portfolio and shrink production to grow free cash flow per share.'], 'article': ['\\n\\nExxon Mobil (XOM) has been a lagging stock in a lagging sector for so long that it basically looks to be 4% long-bond (the dividend is currently 4.8%). The company has had a rough time succeeding in the new \"shale era\" - defined roughly as the red line in the graphic below. The stock is below where it was 10 -years ago. \\n\\nSource: Yahoo Finance As my recently-published Seeking Alpha article on the energy sector pointed out, American energy producers suffer from the fact that there\\'s basically no barrier to competition (see Energy Companies\\' Big Problem? There\\'s No Moat). Horizontal drilling and fracking technology is readily reproducible and easily acquired. Even the biggest energy companies cannot buy up all the leasehold acreage across the many lower 48 shale plays. The Eagle Ford, Marcellus, Utica, Permian, Niobrara, Bakken, Haynesville and SCOOP/STACK plays are now being exploited by dozens and dozens of companies that produce large quantities of oil, natural gas and NGLs.\\n The result is that US oil production has doubled since 2009 to 11.6 million bpd in the latest report. The U.S. - which used to be a net petroleum importer - is now a net petroleum exporter. American energy exports are elbowing their way into the global energy market. The price of US oil production is dependent on others (primarily OPEC+Russia) to cut back on their production. The type of price volatility we have been experiencing over the past few years is likely to stick around for a long time to come. Simply striving to grow production into a weak price environment is not sufficient to insure success. In fact, it can be strategy for disaster. Exxon was taught this lesson when it arguably over paid for XTO and then watched the price of natural gas crater as a flood of domestic production came online from a plethora of companies working several different shale plays. \\n\\nSource: MacroTrends Turns out the acquisition didn\\'t even return enough to fund the extra dividend obligations due to the 416 million shares Exxon put back on the market to fund the XTO takeover (not to mention the assumption of $10 billion in debt). That\\'s one of the primary reasons Exxon has been such a laggard since the deal was announced in 2009. What Should Exxon Do Now? In my recent \"No Moat\" article, I told investors they should look for companies that have the following attributes:  Excellent source rock (i.e. a low-cost, low breakeven, resource base). Strong balance sheet - investment grade preferred. Smart and flexible shareholder oriented management. \"Special\" assets.  If you don\\'t have all of these, you will likely not succeed in the volatile and generally \"lower for longer\" oil and gas price environment I see lasting for many years to come.\\n Now Exxon has a strong balance sheet and some decent \"special assets.\" But it has two problems that need to be addressed: It doesn\\'t have a really low-cost asset base (or the stock would have performed much better over the past 10 years) and it doesn\\'t have flexible shareholder-friendly management. Those are the two problems Exxon needs to fix in order to get its stock moving again. To high grade its resource base, Exxon needs to sell off low-quality production assets. ConocoPhillips (COP) is a great example of how a company can \"shrink to grow.\" Shrink production, but grow the stock price by increasing free cash flow per share. A focus on shareholder returns led COP to sell the majority of its high-cost oil sands production and the majority of its lower 48 dry gas production. Before those asset sales, COP\\'s full-year 2016 production was 1.567 million boe/d. The most recent quarter\\'s production was 1.224 million boe/d, or a decline of ~350,000 boe/d over the past couple of years. Yet during that same time period, the stock went from the low $40s to nearly $80 before the recent sell-off began. Why? Because the company high graded its production profile, paid down debt to an investment grade level, and focused on generating free cash flow. As a result, COP generated $1.9 billion of free cash flow in Q3 and is now breakeven at $40/bbl WTI. I suggest Exxon perform the same scrub on its asset base and sell off low-return production. At the same time, Exxon needs to upgrade its resource base. This can be achieved by buying Hess Corp. (HES) and to substantially increase its share of a very low-cost source of oil: The Guyana discoveries. I have written previously on Seeking Alpha about Exxon\\'s world class discoveries in Guyana (see Why Is Nobody Talking About Exxon\\'s Gigantic Discoveries in Guyana?). Since that article was published recoverable reserve estimates have grown from 3.2 billion boe to 5 billion boe and the World Oil & Gas Council voted Exxon Mobil the 2018 Large Cap Company and Explorer of the Year. Five discoveries were announced in Guyana in 2018 and 10 discoveries since 2015.\\n \\n\\nSource: Corporate Presentation Exxon Mobil is the operator in Guyana and holds a 45% interest in the Stabroek Block. Hess has a 30% interest and CNOOC Nexen Petroleum Guyana Limited holds 25% interest. When Exxon made its 10th discovery earlier this month, the company said: The Liza Phase 1 development is expected to begin producing up to 120,000 barrels oil per day by early 2020, utilizing the Liza Destiny floating storage, production and offloading vessel (FPSO). As previously announced, Liza Phase 2 is expected to start up by mid 2022. Pending government and regulatory approvals, Liza Phase 2 project sanction is expected in early 2019 and will use a second FPSO designed to produce up to 220,000 barrels per day. Sanctioning of a third development, Payara, also is expected in 2019 with start up as early as 2023. Because of the world-class nature of these discoveries, Exxon and its partners have decided to accelerate development. The estimated production ramp-up now looks like this: \\n\\nSource: Exxon Corporate Presentation So within five years, the Guyana partners could well be pumping 500,000 boe/d in Guyana. Exxon\\'s 45% cut would equate to 225,000 boe/d. But if Exxon bought HES and its 30% interest in Guyana, XOM\\'s cut would equate to 375,000 boe/d. And this is high-quality crude we\\'re talking about. And note that even at 500,000 boe/d, a 5 billion boe resource would take more than 25 years to run dry. That would take Exxon through to the point in which more new car sales are apt to be electric powered as opposed to gasoline. This is the primary catalyst for Exxon to buy Hess. It\\'s an era-ending type investment that can prevent more speculative and even mal-investment.\\n And now would be a good time. Hess\\' stock price has been hammered since the initial euphoria of the Guyana wore off. After trading up to $74 in October, the stock is now down to $41 and change: \\n\\nSource: Yahoo Finance According to the most recent 10-Q, Hess currently has $6.6 billion in long-term debt. Add that to the current $12.3 billion market cap as reported by Yahoo Finance (see above) and we get a total estimated enterprise value of ~$19 billion. Note this is less than 7% of Exxon\\'s current ~$290 billion market cap. Obviously Exxon would have to offer a premium to the current stock price, but it\\'s also obvious that Exxon has the means to take Hess out. However, along with the increased share of production comes an increased obligation in Guyana\\'s required development capital expenditures. So this buyout only makes sense if Exxon\\'s management makes the transaction while being focused on total shareholder returns. That means cutting back capital expenditures on other exploration and production ventures. It means acknowledging that simply growing production isn\\'t the key to shareholder success. It means the company must strive to lower its breakeven point by selling under-performing assets and monetizing midstream assets to increase free cash flow per share. That is what will get the stock moving - not simply growing production and getting \"bigger.\" It also means acknowledging the obvious: That despite its size, that\\'s not a guarantee that shareholders will get a good total return. In fact, I\\'d argue that Exxon\\'s obsession with staying big - and getting bigger for \"big\\'s sake\" - has been at odds with delivering total shareholder returns. The last 10 years proves that. Meantime, ConocoPhillips has proven that it\\'s OK to \"shrink to grow.\" This is a lesson that Exxon management needs to learn.\\n HES has a decent business in the Bakken and expects to grow production to 200,000 boe/d by 2021. Exxon also has a nice position in the Bakken. I say sell it all to reduce the impact of the acquisition, to reduce WTI exposure (remember, Exxon is currently rapidly growing Permian production as well), and to concentrate on Guyana as its primary goal. \\n\\nSource: Hess Investor Day Presentation There are other Hess assets that Exxon should take a look at selling as well. But the bottom line should be to focus on delivering total returns to shareholders, not simply growing production and getting big for big\\'s sake. At the end of the day, Exxon needs to acknowledge the reality that the oil and gas business is not the same as it was in the company\\'s heyday. Energy producers now compete in a \"no moat\" business where literally dozens and dozens of American companies are producing significant quantities of oil and gas. Exxon has an advantage in offshore Guyana, and it should press that advantage while simultaneously slimming down by selling its lower margin assets. Heck, even HES\\'s own presentation shows that how much more cost efficient Liza (i.e. Guyana) is as compared to the Bakken (see graphic below). A rough estimate from this graphic is that Liza\\'s breakeven is about $15/bbl lower than the Bakken: \\n\\nSource: Hess Investor Day Presentation This is the reason to double down on Guyana and cut back on the Bakken.\\n Meantime, Exxon also needs to acknowledge that while about half the U.S. still denies global warming exists, the rest of the planet is pretty much unanimous about the matter and wants to take steps to address the issue. That means an increasing number of electric vehicles are going to find their way to markets around the world. At some point, global oil demand will turn down. Shareholders better hope Exxon is still not trying to increase production when those days come, and instead - between now and then - tries to deliver total returns to shareholders who have been suffering for over a decade now. Once market observers and institutional and small investors realize that Exxon Mobil\\'s management finally \"gets it,\" and cares more about free cash flow per share than overall production and revenue, that\\'s when the stock will move higher. If Exxon\\'s management doesn\\'t get it, we\\'ll be lucky to look back after the coming decade and see any positive return at all. Simply increasing production into a weak price environment doesn\\'t work. The XTO transaction proved that.\\nDisclosure: I am/we are long COP, XOM.

At the start of 2018, I last looked at the shares which traded around $40 at the time, as I warned about the heightened expectations in combination with a lack of progress in margins despite the improving revenue mix. After a boom-bust cycle, which left shares down 25% from that point in time, 2018 has been better than expected from an operating point of view, and I see appeal emerging. Nonetheless, I require just a slightly larger pullback before getting really excited. Business And Past Thesis Roku offers a compelling solution for consumers - an integrated platform to stream content from multiple providers. While many consumers rely on Netflix (NFLX) alone for their share of programs, there are more options out there, and for consumers going after more packages, Roku offers a good solution. This is certainly the case if you prefer live sports or music as well. Note that it is not just a convenient for consumers to access all this entertainment from a single library; content providers (notably with limited offerings) benefit as well. By smartly positioning itself as a middleman, I see the appeal of Roku, although the long-term value-add can be debated. Following a very successful IPO late in 2017, in which shares rose quickly to $50 overnight, I have been somewhat cautious and briefly held short positions. After a setback in spring of 2018, shares joined the FANG momentum rally to a high of $77 before violently selling off again to $30 currently. Given the continued growth and lower expectations, it is time to review the prospects, although one has to realise that even at $30, following a 60% pullback from the high, shares are essentially still trading with +100% gains compared to the preliminary offering range at $12-14 per share about a year ago.\\n Valuation Talks Roku has seen solid revenue growth in recent years, yet one has to clearly look at the revenues composition. Roku reported a 28% increase in sales for the year of 2017; the shift in revenue mix is good. Revenues from hardware were actually down 2% to $287.4 million for 2017, but that is not a big issue with gross margins coming in at just 10% or so. Lucrative platform revenues rose by 115% to $225.4 million, with gross margins exceeding 75%. On total revenues of $513 million, Roku was able to cut operating losses in half to $19.6 million, as accelerating growth and changes in revenue mix made investors quite upbeat on the prospects for the stock. Note that around the time these results were released in February, shares traded at $40. With 119 million shares outstanding on a fully-diluted basis, this came down to a $4.6 billion enterprise valuation, at roughly 9 times sales (although this includes a large portion of low-margin and stagnant hardware revenues). For 2018, the company outlined a guidance calling for sales of $660-690 million, although EBITDA losses were still seen between minus $10 and minus $25 million. Ever since, operating momentum has been solid. Upon the release of the first-quarter results, the sales guidance was hiked to $685-705 million, with EBITDA seen between minus $10 million and positive $5 million. The guidance was hiked again when the second-quarter results came out, with revenues seen at $710-730 million, and EBITDA now projected at $11-23 million. When the company released third-quarter results in November, it hiked the sales guidance again to $722-732 million, with EBITDA seen at $21-28 million. So while the mix keeps improving this year, thanks to rapid platform revenue growth, the company is failing to deliver on real operating leverage on the bottom line through leverage of R&D and SG&A costs, among others, as net losses are still seen between $13 and $20 million this year. With a fully diluted share count of 107 million shares, shares represent a value of $3.2 billion at $30 per share, and including $180 million in net cash, I arrive at an enterprise valuation of $3.0 billion. That values shares at just 4 times sales, although EBITDA, let alone earnings multiples, remains sky-high. The reason for that is that despite the rapid and even accelerating growth in 2018, and improving revenue mix, the actual bottom-line results have not seen any leverage at all.\\n About The Long-Term Outlook In past articles, I envisioned a scenario, where let\\'s say in 2023 an ARPU of $15-20 and 100 million accounts could create a $1.5-2.0 billion service revenue giant. A 50% operating margin and 20 times multiple could warrant a $12-16 billion valuation in that case. The company remains somewhat on track to achieve this. The customer count stood at 23.8 million at the end of Q3 2018. This marked 7 million account gains in the past 12 months, equal to 43% growth. To achieve the hundred-million mark, Roku will need to add 15 million users each year for the coming five years, although the percentage growth is less of course. I must say that I am more impressed with the ARPU generated already, and it has increased 37% year on year to $17.34. Working with a perhaps more realistic 50 million user count and ARPU of $20 going forward, I still end up with $1.0 billion in potential revenues, perhaps $500 million in operating earnings, $400 million in net earnings, and thus $8 billion in valuation. That looks quite realistic and was a reason why I was not attracted to the shares with a $5 billion valuation at the start of 2018, but a current $3 billion valuation looks more compelling. After all, that works down to a compounded annual growth rate of 22% per annum, if achieved in three years\\' time. Note that the $8 billion valuation was already achieved during the 2018 peak valuation for the shares of course. Turning Cautiously Optimistic I like the basic principle of Roku for those cord-cutters who are tired of expensive packages and complicated set-up in terms of streaming these on TV. The truth of the matter is that Roku is sort of an expensive middleman, as consolidating moves from Disney (NYSE:DIS) and Hulu create risks. This is certainly the case as Roku is passing on expensive ARPU onto consumers, and facing the risk of people willing to undergo the \"hassle\" of running multiple streaming services trough separate platforms/apps. Nonetheless, Roku has a real advantage in terms of scale, brand recognition and first-mover advantage, which gives it a competitive edge, and the unique position of the company makes it a takeout target as well. So, while I have been cautiously short again in the $60s during 2018, shares have comfortably fallen back to their neutral zone, with valuations almost becoming compelling enough to start buying on the dip and to take advantage of the ability to trade around positions given the heightened volatility.\\n\\nPlease subscribe to Value In Corporate Events - Marketplace Checkout to obtain premium research on all the latest IPOs, M&A activity and other corporate events.

It is because fundamentally the Russian market is not prone to significant growth in the coming year. \\n\\n Judging by the dynamics of GDP, the Russian economy has already been out of recession for two years. Yet, there has been no acceleration of the economy, and the breakthroughs in GDP growth of over 1.5% YoY have been temporary. And the coming year is unlikely to be an exception. \\n\\n In November, the Russian retail turnover rose unexpectedly by 3% YoY, showing the second best result in the current year:\\n \\n\\n It is surprising that at the same time there was a decrease in the growth rates of real and nominal wages, and the Russia’s population real disposable income fell by 2.9% YoY: \\n\\n\\n\\n This paradox can be explained by two factors. Firstly, deferred demand was activated, when the population postponed some of the expenses for the period of New Year’s Eve sales. Secondly, the increase in citizens’ expenses was achieved due to an increase in crediting. This is confirmed by official data, according to which the debts of Russia’s residents to banks grow twice as fast as wages. So, I do not think that the November result of retail trade can be regarded as a fundamental change in the negative trend. The forthcoming VAT increase will put a burden on consumers. The start of the pension reform will lead to the fact that about 2 million people will not retire next year. In addition, the ruble’s weakness and the persistent falling of the population real disposable income will prevent retail from growing faster in 2019 than in the current year. A moderate slowdown is even more likely. Now let's look at the industrial production.\\n In November, the industrial production growth was lower than the average for the year and amounted to 2.4% YoY: \\n\\nThe main contribution to this outcome, as usual, was made by mining (+7.8% YoY), the manufacture sector showed zero results: \\n\\n Considering the dynamics of the components of industrial production for the current year, it is easy to notice that only mining showed stable growth with signs of acceleration. This means that by the end of the year its relative contribution to the overall result of industrial production has increased. And it is a negative signal for the next year, since the OPEC+ agreement prescribes Russian oil producers to reduce production in the first half of 2019. In consideration of the price collapse in the oil market, observed since October this year, this will lead to a slowdown in the growth rate of the entire industry from at least January to June. You should also pay attention to the fact that even those Russian companies that have not fallen under the US sanctions are experiencing difficulties when working with foreign agents. This is because of the fact that foreign partners before making financial transactions in Russia coordinate them with the US Treasury Department. This results in payment delays that can be for a month. In general, the prospect of an escalation of the sanctions destroys the business climate in Russia and drastically reduces its investment attractiveness.\\n Bottom line Speaking about the prospects of the Russian market in 2019, in my opinion the negative factors will overbalance. Of these, the key ones are (1) the likely introduction of new sanctions, (2) the slowdown in the growth of the mining industry on account of the forced reduction of oil production under the OPEC+ agreement and (3) weak domestic demand due to the increase in VAT and decline in real incomes of the population. All these factors make hopes for the growth of the Russian market in 2019 delusive. In these circumstances, despite the attractive price level, the prospects of VanEck Vectors Russia ETF growth in the first half of 2019 seem too insignificant to buy.\\nDisclosure: I/we have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

Meanwhile, analysts have been cutting their revenue and earnings estimates for the company over the past quarter. But Netflix may have a few tricks up its sleeve to help drive subscriber additions in the final days of the year. Google trends is showing the term \"Netflix Subscription\" is hot and at highest levels during the past five years worldwide. The surge in the search term comes at the company releases its first adult interactive show Black Mirror Bandersnatch on Dec. 28. But options are suggesting the market is highly uncertain about the company\\'s fourth quarter results and are expecting a huge spike in volatility to follow. Net Additions The company guided streaming net additions for the fourth quarter to 9.4 million, 35% more than the third quarter net additions of 6.96 million subscribers. Netflix also expects total subscribers of 146.50 million. Our model would suggest total subscribers reach approximately 145 million subscribers, which would be light of expectations. However, the model also shows the company may guide first quarter net adds to around 8 million, bringing total subscribers to roughly 153 million. \\n\\n (Mott Capital) Trends The search term \"Netflix Subscription\" on Google Trends would suggest people are actively looking to sign up for the service. Although this is not a perfect measure, it would indicate stronger search results than in the third quarter.\\n Periods that saw trends rising usually resulted in subscriber growth that was higher than the previous quarter, meanwhile periods that saw trends falling had subscriber growth that was weaker than the previous quarter. The one exception to the rule thus far has been in the second quarter of 2018, which was the quarter that was likely impacted by the World Cup. The trends would suggest that Netflix sees a stronger quarter for net additions than the third quarter. The fourth quarter also has seen the strongest trends historically, with 7.05 million net adds in 2016 and 8.3 million in 2017. \\n\\n (Google) Cutting Earnings Analysts consensus estimates for earnings have dropped roughly 50% to $0.24 per share since the company reported in October. Meanwhile, revenue estimates have held steady at around $4.2 billion. \\n\\nNFLX Revenue Estimates for Current Quarter data by YCharts Big Volatility The options market suggests Netflix results are uncertain and are indicating the stock may see a tremendous amount of volatility after results. The options set to expire on Feb. 15 indicate the stock may rise or fall by as much as 18.5%, using the long straddle options strategy, from the $255 strike price. That places the stock in a trading range between $210 and $302 by expiration. Technical Break Out? Additionally, the technical chart shows that the stock is nearing a technical break out should the price rise above a downtrend. That trend lower started in early October, and a breakout may result in the stock rising to around $300.\\n  \\n\\nRisks There are potential risks to the model, as the forecasting can be off. Additionally, Google Trends is known to change, and as the second quarter net adds shows is not a perfect barometer. Also, even though Google Trends suggests that this quarter should show stronger net additions than the third quarter, it cannot give an accurate gauge that it will be better than the guidance the company laid out. The technical chart also suggests there\\'s downside risk as well. Should the stock not break out and rise above the downtrend, the stock is likely to retest its recent lows. For now, it would seem that the trends are beginning to once again favor Netflix. However, the stakes seem very high especially given the stock\\'s steep declines in recent months.

Even the weakness provoked crackdown on debt should be a long-term positive. E-commerce is still one of the most disruptive sectors in world's economy, and Alibaba is a giant in this space. The current market rout has brought a severe price decline, and a quick reevaluation shows us that the risk/reward proposition has changed considerably.  \\n\\n (Photo credit: leighklotz) Secular trends support online retail in China E-commerce has enjoyed the spotlight when looking at the new trends in the retail sector. And, Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) has become the synonym for online retail. The stock price appreciation is short of impressive and its ticker rests among the hottest right now. On the other end of the spectrum, traditional retail is under siege and investors are backing away from it. If in the US, online retail is a hot sector, in China, it should be even hotter. The reason for that is that the legacy commercial infrastructure is smaller than the US and, therefore, no constraints to bet heavily on internet retailing. As China transitions to a consumption-based economy, retail will play a bigger role in the economy. And, in China's case, given what we said earlier, it will be biased towards online retail. China's deleveraging efforts will be rewarded In addition to the secular trends supporting retail, we also have to consider the current policy framework. The governmental authorities are actively trying to deleverage the economy. In the short term, that is already having a negative impact on the market, but, in the long term, it will strengthen the Chinese economy. Therefore, the current Chinese macro scenario is one that points toward a sustainable growth of the retail sector, in the long term, with possible turbulence in the mid term.\\n Alibaba is fundamentally sound We have looked at the top-down perspective, now let's take a look from a bottom-up perspective. To take advantage of the e-commerce secular trends, we will use Alibaba (NYSE:BABA). That's one of the best known Chinese e-commerce names and one of the most interesting companies out there. Table 1 - Snapshot figures for Alibaba at year end (31 March 2018) \\n\\n (Source: Alibaba's SEC filings) Looking at margins, Alibaba has a profit margin above 25% and a gross margin close to 57%. That has been recurring and reveals a powerful business model. Additionally, looking at table 2, it becomes evident that commerce is the main contributor to the revenues. Table 2 - Income Statement as a percentage of Revenue \\n\\n (Source: Alibaba's SEC filings) A bit like Amazon, Alibaba is also trying to explore other areas as cloud computing, digital services, and entertainment. But, commerce is still the engine of the company. Bear in mind that, for online retailers, having cloud computing and artificial intelligence assets is vital to have a good run operation. It makes only sense that once you have the infrastructure, you try to derive revenue out of it. Be as it may, for our purpose, Alibaba fits our search for a pure play on the Chinese online retail. Alibaba is very well positioned to benefit from secular trends in e-commerce. The 17.5% return-on-equity speaks volumes on behalf of the company's business model robustness. The current ratio at 1.89 and a low debt-to-assets ratio around 18%, comply with a deleveraging macroeconomic scenario for the Chinese economy.\\n Scenario analysis for Alibaba valuation in 2020 Starting from the macro scenario above, it is reasonable to expect high double-digit growth in revenues. The company still predicts around 50% revenue growth for FY2019. Additionally, we expect the business model to remain robust, maintaining the current profit margin level. That's the central scenario and, in our opinion, the most likely one. Additionally, to provide some color, we also include one pessimistic and one optimistic scenario. Table Scenario analysis for Alibaba's valuation (USD to CNY at 6.88) \\n\\n (Source: Author's calculations) In our FY 2020 central scenario, we have dropped the revenue growth a bit, but we still expect the profit margins to hold. That being the case, we value the company at 30 times earnings (lower than the current 40x), which offers a 48% return on the current price. In the pessimistic scenario, we drop revenue growth significantly from the current levels. We've also lowered the profit margin and the valuation. Still, the result is a return of -25%. The optimistic scenario revolves around maintaining the revenue growth and slightly improving the profit margin. The valuation reflects that. Given the current short-term macro scenario, we believe the price will fall somewhere between the pessimistic and normal scenarios. Bear in mind that positive developments around the trade negotiations will likely push the valuation towards the normal scenario. On the other hand, negative developments will depress the valuation, and therefore, converging with our negative scenario. The current bear market in this stock has made the potential returns seem asymmetric, clearly favoring the upside (between the pessimistic and normal scenarios) by a significant margin. The optimistic scenario is a wild card on the upside, and at the current price, one can argue that investors are getting paid to have it.\\n For the long term, Alibaba seems both a good macro and stock picking call. In the short term, the current macro uncertainty isn't good for most stocks. However, the prevailing market depression is equally punishing many different stocks, and in my opinion, it is the cause of a very interesting risk/reward relationship in this company.\\n\"]}\n",

Investment Thesis  In our view, a robust U.S. industrial recovery will continue to provide a significant tailwind to Olympic Steel (NASDAQ:ZEUS). In 1H18, all three operating segments generated double-digit top line growth and strong operating income. A shift to higher value-added products and the ongoing operational efficiency program are likely to improve margins. The expansion of the Schaumburg facility and the acquisition of Berlin Metals in April 2018 will further strengthen ZEUS's product portfolio in the higher dollar margin specialty metals segment. Management further stated that they continue to remain bullish in their third quarter outlook and for the remainder of 2018. The order book remains solid with visibility well into the fourth quarter driven by strong demand from original equipment manufacturers (OEMs). The company is poised to grow revenues and earnings over the near to medium term. We initiate coverage with a BUY rating and a price target of $22.75. \\n Primary Risks  The company's sales and earnings are highly dependent on steel prices and any decline in prices could negatively affect operating results. The company faces risks stemming from a heightened U.S.-China trade war. Any further escalation could weaken the results.  Investment Thesis Olympic Steel is a leading U.S. metals service center focused on the direct sale and distribution of large volumes of processed carbon, coated and stainless flat-rolled sheet, coil and plate steel, aluminum, tin, pipe, and tubular products. The company continues to show solid business momentum driven by robust industrial demand in the U.S. A shift to higher value-added products and the ongoing operational efficiency program are likely to improve margins. Management noted the strong demand from OEMs should support momentum into 2019. Our thesis is ZEUS can drive growth and deliver value for shareholders through successful pursuit of strategic objectives, which include:  Accretive acquisitions Expanding margins by enhancing product mix Diversifying products and end markets, and expanding geographically to reduce cyclicality.  We believe ZEUS is positioned to benefit from the U.S.'s robust GDP growth and industrial recovery. In 1H18, all three operating segments generated double-digit top line growth and strong operating income. YTD 2018 operating income of $37 million was the highest in ten years. Management noted that strong industrial demand is likely to continue for the remainder of the year. The order book remains solid with visibility well into the fourth quarter driven by strong demand from OEMs. Management is focused on increasing the mix of higher margin value-added products. The share of revenue from the higher margin dollar specialty metals and Tube and Pipe segments has consistently increased since 2007, while the share of revenue from the lower margin and more cyclical Carbon flat products has dropped from ~87% in 2007 to ~63% in 1H18. The expansion of the Schaumburg facility and the acquisition of Berlin Metals in April 2018 will further strengthen ZEUS's product portfolio in the higher margin dollar specialty metals segment.\\n ZEUS will continue to look for acquisition opportunities that are immediately accretive to the existing business. Management is targeting downstream businesses that expand margins by enhancing product mix. These downstream businesses bolster ZEUS's product mix by adding new products that require multi-stage processing/fabrication. Furthermore, the ongoing profit improvement program, which includes working capital management and operating efficiency improvements, is likely to increase margins. Our recommendation is based on the expectation that management can execute on the growth plan it has outlined which maintaining balance sheet leverage without incurring large amounts of additional debt. We initiate coverage with a BUY rating and a $22.75 price target. M&A and organic investments drive growth. Management noted that their internal growth projects remain on target. The company installed a long bed tube laser at Chicago Tube in 2018 and in the second half of 2018, commenced operations at their stainless-steel slitting line in Streetsboro, Ohio. The 2018 expansion of a 42,0000 square foot facility in Schaumberg, Illinois is on track as planned. The Schaumburg facility with house the new Herr-Voss cut-to-length line dedicated to stainless steel. Framing work is complete on the building expansion and the new processing equipment is expected to begin production in late 2018. In April 2018, ZEUS acquired the assets of Berlin Metals. Berlin is a well-established, successful service center specializing in tin and stainless-steel strip products with ~$50 million in annual sales. This acquisition strengthens the company's growing stainless-steel business and diversifies its product portfolio with the addition of prime tin mill products. These tin mill products create cross-selling opportunities to new and existing customers. The acquisition is expected to be immediately accretive. Management will continue to look for acquisition opportunities that are immediately accretive to the existing business. Management noted that they are targeting downstream businesses that expand margins by enhancing product mix and by increasing value-added products that require multi-stage processing/fabrication.\\n A shift to a higher value product mix supports margins. Management is focused on increasing the mix of higher margin value-added products. The share of revenue from the higher margin dollar specialty metals and Tube and Pipe segments has increased since 2007, while the share of revenue from the lower margin and more cyclical Carbon flat products has dropped from ~87% in 2007 to ~63% in 1H18. The upcoming Schaumburg facility and the acquisition of Berlin Metals in April 2018 will further expand ZEUS's product portfolio in the higher margin specialty metals segment. Furthermore, the ongoing profit improvement program, which includes working capital management and operating efficiency improvements, is likely to increase margins. Some of management's initiatives include improving asset turnover, reducing transportation costs, six sigma/lean practices, optimizing mill sourcing, and consolidating administrative functions. \\n\\n Robust U.S. Industrial Demand Drives Growth We are encouraged by the U.S.'s robust GDP growth and industrial recovery. According to the latest manufacturing report from the Institute of Supply Management, economic activity in the manufacturing sector expanded in September 2018, and the overall economy grew for the 113th consecutive month. Demand remains strong with the New Orders Index at 60% or above for the 17th straight month, and the Customers' Inventories Index remains low. We expect ZEUS to benefit from these favorable macroeconomic trends as the steel industry tends to experience growth when U.S. GDP grows. In 1H18, all three operating segments generated double-digit top line growth and strong operating income. YTD 2018 operating income of $37 million was the highest in ten years. Management noted that strong industrial demand is likely to continue throughout the remainder of 2018 and into 2019. The order book remains strong with visibility well into the fourth quarter, driven by strong demand from OEMs.\\n Diverse Customer-Base and Geographic Footprint ZEUS has a diverse customer and geographic base, which helps to reduce the inherent risk and cyclicality of the business. However, ZEUS experiences annual seasonality with Q2 being the strongest, followed by Q1, Q4, and Q3. Net sales to the top three customers stood at ~8.0% of consolidated net sales in 2017. The company has 31 facilities with more than 3.7 million square feet in the U.S. and Mexico (94% owned). Most of the company's manufacturing facilities are strategically located near mills and customers, thus enabling an efficient delivery system capable of handling a high frequency of short lead time orders. The company transports products directly to customers via its own in-house truck fleet, which further supports the just-in-time delivery requirements of the customers. As of 1H18, ZEUS has a truck fleet of ~80 tractors and 100 trailers. This fleet fulfills core shipping requirements and creates reliable just-in-time logistic advantages. Business Model Olympic Steel is a leading U.S. metals service center focused on the direct sale and distribution of large volumes of processed carbon, coated and stainless flat-rolled sheet, coil and plate steel, aluminum, tin and pipe, and tubular products. Current business objectives revolve around diversifying products, end markets, expanding geographic reach, and increasing the mix of higher margin value-added products. Similarly, the company has been making organic investments and targeting acquisitions strategically that will enable the company to shift to a higher value product mix. During 2017, the company created a new position, Vice President of Strategic Development. The new role's main purpose is to find profitable growth opportunities, including acquisitions. Organic investments during the past three years have primarily been aimed to increase presence in higher value-added products and solutions. For the customers in Winder, Georgia, these investments include a slitter for the specialty metals flat products segment and a stretcher leveling line. For the customers in Cleveland, Ohio, Locust, North Carolina, and Monterey, Mexico, these investments include new tube and pipe distribution capabilities. In all three segments, management has added additional processing equipment to increase margins and top line growth.\\n \\n\\n Industry Overview U.S. steelmakers continue to gain from strong steel consumption in the domestic market across major industries such as construction, automotive, and energy. U.S. steel prices have received a significant boost this year after the Section 232 tariffs came into effect. The 25% tariff on steel imports, which the Trump administration levied in March 2018, is boosting production capacity of domestic steelmakers amid lower imports. The U.S. steel industry capacity utilization rate jumped above the 80% mark in September 2018, reflecting the impact of the tariffs, and is currently hovering close to that level. The tariffs have provided a boost to U.S. steel prices, giving U.S. steelmakers more pricing power. U.S. steel prices are on an uptrend following the tariff announcement, reflected by a spike in hot-rolled steel prices. Midwest Domestic Hot Rolled Coil Steel prices have risen 26.5% YTD to $835 per short ton. For the overall U.S. steel industry, higher prices have provided a boost to margins in the second and third quarters and the momentum is likely to continue for the remainder of the year. While prices have corrected recently and are likely to be lower in 2019, the overall momentum in steel prices has remained strong. The construction, automotive, and energy sectors are among the largest steel end consumers. U.S. housing starts rebounded in August 2018 compared to the last few months. These starts came in at 1.282 million units, which implies a rise of 9.2% YoY. Leading indicators show a rebound in nonresidential construction activity as well. While the construction activity rebounded in August, there could still be weakness ahead for the sector due to rising interest rates. Automotive sales have been reasonably strong for the first nine months of this year. These sales should continue to support steel demand. The energy sector's steel demand outlook also looks strong, led by higher energy prices.\\n However, the industry faces risks stemming from the heightened U.S.-China trade war and from a possible cooling of the Chinese economy. The intensifying trade tensions could negatively affect steel demand. \\n\\n Management and Shareholders The company is currently led by CEO Michael D. Siegal who has been CEO since 1984. Effective January 1, 2019, Mr.Siegal has announced to step down and will be succeeded by the company's current Chief Financial Officer, Richard Marabito. Mr. Siegal will become the Executive Chairman of the company. Effective January 1, 2019, Richard Manson has been elected to succeed Mr. Marabito as the company's CFO. On the company's most recent earnings press release, the company reported 11.0 million shares outstanding. A summary of key shareholdings follows. \\n\\n Growth Strategy Management aims to aggressively pursue profitable growth through M&A as well as organic investments. Management plans to expand the company's geographic reach and increase the mix of higher margin value-added products, organically and through acquisitions. Management will focus on M&A opportunities in downstream businesses which expand margins by enhancing product mix and by increasing value-added products that require multi-stage processing/fabrication. The company continues to add equipment to its existing facilities for margin enhancement and productivity improvements. The company's market share for high margin stainless steel sheet and coil reached ~6.7% in 1H18. We expect the investments made over the past three years to continue to drive growth across the segments, specifically the specialty metals and Tube & Pipe segments.\\n For the customers in Winder, Georgia, these investments include a slitter for the specialty metals flat products segment and a stretcher leveling line. For the customers in Cleveland, Ohio, Locust, North Carolina, and Monterey, Mexico, these investments include new tube and pipe distribution capabilities. In all three segments, management has added additional processing equipment to increase margins and top line growth. We expect a robust U.S. industrial economy to continue to support steel demand and business momentum. A strong order book with visibility well into the fourth quarter provides top line optimism. Financial Results (Latest Period Q3:18 and 9M18) Total revenue was up 38% to $457 vs. $331 million in the prior year quarter. Year-to-date net sales grew 26% over the prior year's same period, reaching a record $1.3 billion versus $1.0 billion in 2017. Higher year-over-year shipping volume and higher average prices drove the sales increase in both periods. All three of the company's operating segments increased net sales by more than 30% in Q3:18 and more than 19% year-to-date compared with the same period one year ago. Year-over-year net sales of carbon flat products increased 31% in Q3:18 and by 20% in the first nine months of 2018. Specialty metals year-over-year net sales were up 60% in Q3:18 and up 47% year-to-date. Pipe and tube revenue was up 41% for the third quarter and 27% for the first nine months of the year. Gross margin stood at ~20% in Q3:18, compared with 19.9% in Q3:17. For the 9M18, consolidated gross margin was 20.9% versus 21.1% in 2017. Gross profit dollars grew 39% YOY to $92 million in Q3:18. For 9M18, gross profit dollars rose 25% to $269 million up from $216 million for the first nine months of 2017. Operating income reached $18.6 million in Q3:18, which more than tripled compared with Q3:17. Year-to-date operating income has grown to $55.3 million, more than double that of the same period last year. Net income rose to $11.6 million or $1.01 per diluted share and was more than five times the net income of $2.3 million or $0.20 per share in last year's third quarter. Year to date net income rose to $31.5 million or $3.07 per diluted share compared with $14.8 million or $1.30 per share last year. This result includes a LIFO expense for the pipe and tube segment of $2.7 million in Q3:18 and $4.7 million for 9M18. Excluding a LIFO expense, net income per diluted share was $1.19 in Q3:18 and $3.37 in 9M18.\\n EPS Guidance and Estimates Management continues to invest in internal projects and pursue opportunistic M&A which should drive business momentum going forward. We expect growth across its major verticals specifically the specialty metals flat segment and the Tube and Pipe segment. Our forecast assumes contributions from the higher dollar margin Specialty Metals and Tube and Pipe segments to gradually rise. Our forecast includes LIFO expenses for the pipe and tube segment. Revenue for 2018 (one quarter left) is forecasted at $387.1 million. For 2018, 2019 and 2020, we forecast revenue growth of 25.7%, 3.1% and 4.1% resulting in $1,672.6, $1,725.1 and $1,796.2 million of revenue, respectively. We expect internal investments and the recent M&A's to add scale to operations and enhance margins. As a result of these investments, we forecast a 230 basis points operating income margin expansion during 2018. In 2017, the company's operating income margin was 1.8%. We are forecasting an improvement in margins to ~4.1% in 2018. For 2019, we expect margins to come under pressure given the anticipated decline in steel prices. For FY 2019 and 2020, we model operating income margin of 2.9% and 3.3%, respectively. We forecast EBITDA of $85.3, $67.0 and $76.1 million for 2018, 2019 and 2020, respectively. For 2019 and 2020, we use a tax rate of ~26.5%. In 2018, 2019, and 2020, we forecast net income of $43.0, $28.4, and $34.6 million, respectively. Our forecast results in Earnings per Share of $3.76, $2.48 and $3.02 in 2018, 2019, and 2020. Investment Risks We value ZEUS using a combination of multiples based on industry peer companies (P/E and EV/EBITDA multiples), blended with our Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) valuation to derive a fair value target price for the company. We are valuing ZEUS at the industry average P/E and EV/EBITDA multiples. We are applying these multiples to our forecasted 2020 results. We then average the two targets, after which we discount that average target back at our computed cost of capital. We weight this discounted multiple targets to equal 50% of our price target. The average of these two multiple based targets is $26.69, which discounts back to the present value of $22.68.\\n We weight the other 50% of our target using our Discounted Cash Flow valuation. Our DCF model uses our forecasted free cash flow to the firm over the next two years and then grows EBIT at a 6% rate over years 3-8. We apply a weighted average cost of capital of 8.5%, a combination of an 18.34% cost of equity and a 3.4% pre-tax cost of debt. Thus, our DCF produces a value of $22.99. The combination of $22.68 at 50% and $22.99 at 50% results in a weighted average price target of $22.83, which we round down to $22.75. The exhibit below summarizes our peer group multiples, while the DCF is included at the end of this report. \\n\\n The Exhibit below shows stock price targets using various combinations of forward EPS and P/E multiples. Our EPS estimates for 2018 and 2019 are $3.76 and $2.48. The unshaded portion of the chart shows resulting stock price targets at various forward P/E multiples that are above the current price. \\n\\n The Exhibit below shows price targets based on our DCF model using a range of discount rates and return on capital assumptions. We believe the assumptions that drive our price target are reasonable. \\n\\n\\n\\nDisclosure: I/we have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

One notable and alarming statistic was that the stock market (SPY) had outperformed the bond (BND) for the seventh year in a row in 2017, which had not occurred since the seven-year period from 1922 to 1928. Then there was the arrogance displayed in television commercials by discount brokers like E-trade (ETFC), in which the average Joe celebrates his new-found wealth dancing on board a yacht with a dozen models. I hadn’t seen such silly advertisements since 1999. Perhaps Joe made all his money in Bitcoin (OTCQX:GBTC), or one of the public companies that changed names to connect itself with the cryptocurrency mania of 2017. I shared the example of Riot Blockchain (RIOT), which had soared from $4 to $40 in what looked eerily reminiscent of the dot-com bubble in the late 1990s. \\n\\n It looks like Riot Blockchain should return to making diagnostic machinery for the biotech industry. \\n\\n The crypto-currency craze was a clear warning sign that speculation was rampant. While understanding the appeal of a currency that operates without a central depository, I asserted that it was difficult to consider Bitcoin a store of value, because it has no rate of return other than what you can sell it for to the next speculator. I also suggested that it could decline to $1,000 when everyone wants to run for the exits at the same time. We are getting close!\\n \\n\\n Collectively, these and many other factors indicated that investors’ propensity to take on risk was reaching new heights at a time when the potential for loss could not have been greater. As for today, following a bear-market decline of 20% or more in nearly every major market index, I no longer see the speculative fervor I did a year ago. Returns At the beginning of 2018 the potential for attractive long-term returns from the stock market were not encouraging, due to excessive valuations. They looked even worse in July based on normalized earnings for the S&P 500, as can be seen below. The July statistics didn’t indicate that a correction or bear market decline was around the corner, nor did it mean that the stock market would return just 2.9% each year for the next ten years. It did indicate that a more defensive approach focused on wealth preservation was wise, as we now know. What we did know was that the downside risks were substantial from what were valuations in the top decile of historical norms. \\n\\n It was easy to deflect these valuation concerns as central banks around the world, led by the Federal Reserve, had been manipulating financial asset prices year after year since the early stages of this bull market. They destroyed the natural process of price discovery that we find in a free market. Nearly everyone was drunk on the liquidity pumped into financial markets to the extent that many believed this time might be different. Now we know that not to be the case, and the hangover just taking hold is going to be a doozy.\\n Our economy and markets have been plagued by boom-and-bust cycles, and it appears we are on the cusp of another bust. In this case the boom and the bust fall squarely on the shoulders of the Federal Reserve. We have had one of the longest expansions on record, but it was also one of the weakest, and it was largely dependent on debt. It is clear to me that neither the market or economy can stand on its own two feet without the crutches of monetary stimulus. Last year I saw several signs that the US economy was weakening beneath a seemingly sound foundation, and the situation doesn’t look much different today. Realities This year was a record year for corporate profit growth, but we know that the greatest contributor to that growth was the corporate tax cut. Instead of investing in plant and equipment, as measured by real nonresidential fixed investment, corporations returned nearly $1 trillion to shareholders in the form of stock buybacks. The timing of these purchases couldn’t have been worse given that we are now suffering the worst performing quarter for the S&P 500 index in a decade. At the same time, corporate debt has continued to soar to what is now a record 45% of GDP, exceeding the peaks we saw during the bubbles in technology stocks and housing. This does not reflect a strong foundation to our economy. \\n\\n Even more troubling is that we never saw the record corporate profit growth trickle down to the working population in the form of a meaningful increase in real wages. The middle-class tax cuts were not able to muster as much as a 1% increase in real average hourly earnings. This means that increases in the rate of consumption are largely debt-induced, which is not reflective of economic strength.\\n \\n\\n Another form of fiscal stimulus fueling this expansion was the meteoric rise in student loans. There has been more than $1 trillion in spending on educational services, which has had a significant impact on the rate of economic growth, but it is unsustainable. Total student loan debt now exceeds $1.5 trillion. A decrease in the rate of loan growth in this category will be a headwind to economic growth, as will the burden of servicing this debt. \\n\\n Federal spending accounts for approximately 20% of our economic activity, and the current level of spending is unsustainable. The $1.5 trillion tax cut implemented last year could not have been more fiscally irresponsible. It resulted in a surge in the budget deficit to $779 billion in fiscal 2018. Our deficit will likely surpass $1 trillion in the current fiscal year. Our federal debt now exceeding 100% of our annual economic output and the cost to service that debt is on the rise. Conclusion While speculative activity has subsided, and market valuations have moderated from historic extremes over the past year, the fundamentals underpinning economic growth continue to deteriorate due to rising debt levels for corporations, consumers and the federal government. Borrowing at historically low interest rates has been a huge factor contributing to our economic growth during this expansion, but borrowing costs are on the rise. This slows the rate of new loan growth and increases the cost to service existing debt. Both are headwinds to economic growth as we move forward. It was abundant liquidity and historically low interest rates that allowed our debt-induced growth to last a decade. It also fueled a surge in financial asset prices that produced a wealth effect, further strengthening the rate of consumption. Yet what was the greatest tailwind of them all is now becoming a towering headwind.\\n The greatest risk facing investors today is the gradual unwinding of central bank balance sheets in aggregate, which appears to have started over the past few months. One of the objectives of quantitative easing was to encourage investors to take on more risk by reducing the supply of higher quality and lower risk financial assets and reducing the yield on those assets. This pushed investors further and further out on the risk continuum in search of returns. It led to a plunge in yields and a surge in risk asset prices over the past decade. Now the process is reversing, and a rise in yields and decline in risk asset prices is inevitable in my view. \\n\\n This is the reason that 2018 is now the worst year on record in terms of asset class returns. As we begin the first inning of what I’ll dub The Great Unwind, nearly every asset class is posting negative returns. There is simply nowhere to hide. \\n\\n I expect passive investment strategies will do very poorly as we move forward. Fewer dollars will be chasing an ever-growing supply of financial assets, as central banks drain liquidity from financial markets by reducing the size of their balance sheets . Tactical strategies that focus on adept individual security selection will be paramount. I look forward to sharing my approach with readers as we begin the new year.\\nDisclosure: I/we have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

The most interesting is that the company trades at only 3.66x forward sales. Other peers in the same industry with lower revenue growth and gross profit margin are trading at more than 100x sales. Using the financial figures reported by the company, the undervaluation does not seem justifiable. Business Founded in 2010, New Brunswick-based Organigram Holdings is a licensed producer of dried cannabis and cannabis oil in Canada. Like other cannabis producers, the company is growing its business at a massive rate by building new production facilities and increasing its production capacity. This is exciting as new facilities should mean more revenues in the future. In 2019, expecting production space of approximately 533,000 square feet, the company should be a very interesting name to be followed closely. If the company is able to complete its facilities as promised, shareholders should benefit. The image below provides further details on the company’s future developments:\\n\\n\\n Source: Annual Report In addition to the production of cannabis, the company commenced to supply cannabis for the adult recreational use market in October 2018. The products sold to this industry are a selection of full flower, milled flower, pre-rolls, and cannabis oil. Organigram operates in Alberta, Manitoba, Ontario, and four Atlantic Provinces. According to the annual report, the company’s lineup of products is one of the most diverse products in Canada. The images below provide different brands available, the branding strategy, and certain products offered:\\n\\n Source: Annual Report \\n\\n Source: Company’s Website  What investors should appreciate is the number of supply deals signed by the company. The annual report reads that the company signed nine different deals with third parties. Unfortunately, a lot of details about these deals were not disclosed. The image below provides further details on this matter: \\n\\n Source: Annual Report There are two more features showing the massive business growth of Organigram Holdings. Firstly, the number of registered clients increased from 3,995 in Q1 2017 to 15,730 in Q4 2018. It is 293% increase in less than two years period. Additionally, the number of employees increased from 71 to 356 in the same time period. Both the number of employees and clients are quite a good indicator of potential future revenues. The images below provide further details on this matter:\\n\\n\\n Source: Annual Report\\n\\n Source: Annual Report 231% Increase In The Total Amount Of Assets The increase in the number of assets is another beneficial feature. With $74 million in August 2017, the number of assets increased to $232 million in 2018. The most relevant increases were cash, which increased from $1.5 million to $42 million, and properties, which increased from $36 million to $75 million. The image below provides further details on this matter:\\n\\n Source: OTC Markets There Is Debt, But The Company Should Be Able To Pay It In 2018, the company increased its total amount of liabilities from $7.7 million to $90.4 million. The most significant was the increase in the amount of long term debt from $2.4 million to $75.7 million. The sum of total amount of cash and short term investments is larger than the total long term debt, thus the financial risk is not that elevated. The image below provides the list of liabilities: \\n\\n Source: OTC Markets As of August 31, 2018, the amount of contractual obligations does not seem very worrying. The total amount of contractual obligations equals $109 million. The table below provides further details on this matter:\\n\\n\\n Source: Annual Report (In thousands of Canadian dollars) Regarding the recently issued debt, it consists of convertible debentures paying 6% coupon interest, which most investors should not consider very elevated. It is also very interesting that these convertible securities can be converted at a price per common share of CAD 5.42. As of December 27, 2018, the share price is CAD 4.30. Thus, common stockholders should not worry about stock dilution from these securities. They may not be converted as the conversion price is above the current market price. The lines below provide further details on this matter: \\n\\n Source: Annual Report (In thousands of Canadian dollars) 2,791% Revenue Growth In The Last Three Years The revenue growth also seems quite impressive. The company reported only $1.55 million in 2015 and $44.82 million in August 2018. This means 2,791% revenue growth in three years. The gross profit margin and the operating income are also quite impressive. In August 2018, Organigram reported gross profit of $40.2 million and operating income of $27.9 million. The image below provides further details on the top line of the income statement:\\n\\n Source: OTC Markets Regarding the net income level, Organigram also reported great results in 2018. After delivering losses in 2017 and 2016, in August 2018, the company reported a net income of $15.73 million. With not many cannabis producers reporting positive net income, investors in this industry should appreciate very much the company’s financial figures. The image below provides further details on this matter:\\n\\n\\n Source: OTC Markets Equity Structure And Float The equity structure is not as clean as investors would like. However, the number of convertible securities is not as large as that of other cannabis producers. The total amount of shares outstanding is approximately 125.2 million shares, and the amount of fully diluted shares is approximately 161 million. As of August 31, 2017, Organigram reported options, warrants, restricted share units, and convertible debentures. Shareholders should understand very clearly that these convertible securities increase the stock dilution risk. Keep in mind that holders of these convertibles could exercise their conversion rights issuing new shares, which would reduce the stock's value. The table below provides further details on this matter: \\n\\n Source: Annual Report With that, the OTC Markets exchange shows that the float is quite large, equal to approximately 123 million shares outstanding. This means that stock volatility risk should not be an issue on this name. Many stocks being traded on the OTC Markets exchange show low float. Thus, noting this beneficial feature in this case seems quite necessary. The image below provides further details on the company’s share structure: \\n\\n Source: OTC Markets Valuation With 125.2 million shares outstanding at $3.12, the total market capitalization equals $390 million. Deducting cash of $42 million and short-term investments of $57 million and adding debt of $75 million, the enterprise value equals $366 million.\\n In 2018, the revenue increased from $3.2 million to $44.82 million, which means 1,300% increase. With this figure in mind, assuming forward revenues of $100 million seems reasonable. Using this level of revenue, the shares trade at 3.66x forward sales, which seems very undervalued as compared to other peers. Keep in mind that large cannabis producers are trading at higher valuations and are not growing at the same pace:  Canopy (CGC) trades at 154x sales with revenue growth of 65% and gross profit margin of 1.85%. Aurora (ACB) trades at 136x sales with revenue growth of 233% and gross profit margin of -1.46%. Aphria (APHA) trades at 136x sales with revenue growth of 104.7% and gross profit margin of -1.46%.  While Canopy, Aurora and Aphria seem larger companies than Organigram Holdings, all of them can be compared. Keep in mind that the number of employees are somewhat equal. Canopy, Aurora and Aphria have 1k, 967 and 300 employees respectively, and Organigram has 356 employees. This means that OGRMF should be able to compete and grow in the future like these large peers. It makes sense that the company’s valuation is closer to that reported by them. Conclusion And Risks With a stable financial situation, a 231% increase in the total amount of assets and 2,791% revenue growth in the last three years, Organigram Holdings seems quite appealing. In addition, the company trades at only 3.66x forward sales with other peers trading at more than 100x sales. The undervaluation does not seem justified as competitors are not growing at a higher pace than Organigram. Like most companies in the cannabis industry, Organigram has certain amount of convertible securities, which represent stock dilution risk. The share count is approximately 125.2 million shares, and the amount of fully diluted shares is 161 million. With the company trading in the OTC Markets and Canada, perhaps the amount of liquidity is the main issue on this name. Keep in mind that many investors don’t invest in securities outside the US and don’t appreciate trading over the counter. As a result, the stock demand could be reduced. With this said, if the shares continue trading in the OTC Markets, the share price may not increase.\\n Disclosure: I/we have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin blamed the Volcker Rule and HFT. This WSJ article blames algos (including HFT), but throws the kitchen sink in for good measure. Truth be told, virtually every major market drop is unexplained at the time, and even well after, which only spurs the search for villains and scapegoats. There was no obvious spark for the Crash of \\'87, and in the years since, many suspects have been named but none have been convicted. The same is true of the Crash of \\'29. Perhaps the best effort - interesting, but not definitive - is George Bittlingmayer\\'s attribution of Black Tuesday to an unexpected shift in antitrust policy under the Hoover administration. But that came 65 years after the event! The most recent selloff is no exception. The WSJ article lists a variety of bearish developments, but any such exercise smacks of post hoc ergo propter hoc \"reasoning.\" Further, the article quotes various people who claim that the price decline is difficult to square with fundamental economic data - welcome to the club! The same is true for 1987, 1929, and other major declines. Recall Paul Samuelson\\'s aphorism: the stock market predicted 10 out of the last 5 recessions. Part of the difficulty is that stock prices depend on expected cash flows, and expected returns, both of which can vary due to factors that are difficult to observe in public data. Asset pricing economists have a lot of theories of time varying expected returns - hinging on theories of time varying risk premia - none of which have strong empirical support. Modest changes in risk premia/expected returns can cause big valuation changes. Recent conditions (political/geopolitical risk, monetary policy changes) plausibly have affected risk premia, but our ability to map these relationships is virtually nonexistent, so at best we can formulate largely untestable hypotheses. And untestable hypotheses are effectively speculations and opinions, and like certain body parts, everybody has one.\\n Given these realities, most major asset price movements are difficult to explain. I vividly remember in the aftermath of the 1987 Crash when I was a PhD student at Chicago. Gene Fama distributed a Mandelbrot article to all PhD students. The article presented a simple model in which long periods of price increases are followed by crashes. As I recall, the essence of the model was that if good news was received today, it was likely that there would be good news tomorrow, but if good news was not received today, the likelihood of receiving good news tomorrow was lower. In essence, it is a regime switching model, and a switch in from a good news regime to a bad news regime leads to a big valuation change, due to the transition probabilities. Fama\\'s point in distributing the article was to emphasize that discontinuous changes in prices are not inconsistent with a \"rational\" market. Seemingly small fundamental shifts can lead to big price changes. Again, a hypothesis - and a virtually untestable one. What about blaming algos, a la Mnuchin, and the WSJ? Well, blaming HFT - directly, anyways - makes no sense. Yes, HFT is programmed to respond to market signals, but it is negative feedback by nature. It tends to be stabilizing, not destabilizing. There may be an indirect connection: HFT liquidity supply can dry up when order flow becomes toxic, and the decline in liquidity makes prices more sensitive to order flow, leading to larger price movements. The Flash Crash is a classic example of this. But that\\'s not unique to HFT. It is inherent to market making, and HFT basically puts what is in a market maker\\'s (e.g., old-time floor trader\\'s) synapses into code. Market makers pulling back - or shutting down altogether - occurred long before markets went electronic, and before anybody even dreamed of HFT. If liquidity has declined - and the WSJ points to some limited evidence on this point - it is likely a response to market conditions, rather than a cause thereof. It\\'s something that occurs in almost every period of elevated volatility. It\\'s more of an effect of some common cause than an independent exogenous cause.\\n Further, by virtually every measure, the increasing automation in markets has led to greater liquidity. Much of the bitching - including in some quotes in the WSJ article - emanates from traditional liquidity suppliers who have lost out to more efficient competitors. Believe me, if order flow had become more toxic, these guys would have pulled back too, and probably more severely than HFT has done. What can exacerbate market movements is positive feedback trading strategies. Portfolio insurance during the 1987 Crash is a classic example. The WSJ article points at algorithmic momentum trading strategies, and indeed these are positive feedback in nature. But they are not unique to algos: meatware implemented momentum/trend following strategies long before they were embedded in software. Momentum trading is something else that long predates the rise of the machines. Several quotes in the WSJ article made me laugh. One was: \"\\'Human beings tend not to react this fast and violently.\\'\" Really? Heard of Black Monday? Black Tuesday? Silver Thursday? Black Friday? I\\'m sure there\\'s a Color Wednesday to fill in the week, but none comes to mind. Regardless, the point remains: human beings reacted rapidly and violently long before trading machines were even dreamt of. Here\\'s another: \"Today, when the computers start buying, everyone buys; when they sell, everyone sells.\" This is called \"not an equilibrium.\" The bottom line is that the stock market sometimes declines substantially, without any obvious cause. Indeed, the cause(s) of some of the biggest, fastest drops remain elusive decades after they occurred. This is true across virtually every institutional and technological trading environment, making it less likely that any particular selloff is uniquely attributable to a change in technology. Furthermore, large market moves in the absence of any decisive event or piece of news is not inconsistent with market \"rationality\", or due to some behavioral anomaly (which is inherently human, by the way).\\n But humans crave explanations for phenomena like big movements in the stock market, and this demand calls forth supply. That the explanations are for the most part untestable and hence not scientific only means that there is little check on this supply. Anybody can offer an explanation, which likely cannot be proven wrong. So why not? But if you understand that mechanism, you should also understand that you shouldn\\'t pay much attention.\\n']}\n",

Shares showed quite some volatility and have net fallen to $3.50 upon the announcement of that deal, which was received by some scepticism from the market, including myself. With shares having plunged to $2 per share following the turmoil in the wider market and falling energy prices, it is time to revisit the thesis, certainly with big insider purchases taking place at the moment. This strong signal and massively reduced equity valuation, and thus expectations, result in me being constructive on the shares, as the fall in oil prices is actually entirely compensated for in terms of higher natural gas prices. This creates a much more compelling case for the shares at this point than it has been in a while. About The Deal/Thesis At the end of October, Chesapeake announced a huge deal for WildHorse, which has some real implications for shareholders. In fact, Chesapeake was willing to dilute equity holders another 75%, increasing the share count to more than 1.6 billion shares. Net debt rose in actual dollar terms from $9.8 billion to $11.2 billion in connection with the deal, but CHK was actually deleveraging with that purchase, as EBITDA was growing much more quickly, and most of the WildHorse deal is being paid for in stock. Including the 420,000 net acres in the Eagle Ford, WildHorse adds 47,000 barrels of oil equivalent production, of which nearly 75% is in the form of oil. In comparison to Chesapeake\\'s production of 537,000 barrels of oil equivalent, the deal adds less than 9% to overall production, yet oil production would rise spectacularly from 89,000 to roughly 125,000 barrels.\\n With a $4 billion price tag for WildHorse, and Chesapeake still representing a $13 billion valuation (assuming debt at face value), the multiples could be defended. I was most critical about the deal structure rather than the valuation of the assets. With the deal structure, investors in Chesapeake will a see big dilution, which limits their potential recovery in case oil and gas prices recover, although the $200-280 million in cost/capital investment synergies look appealing, which is equal to $0.15 per share each year. What Now? Despite a recent burst higher in natural gas prices to $4.50 (mostly related to weather), current prices of $3.50 look relatively solid, certainly with crude comfortably below $50 again, marking a big reversal from the recent price ranges. This has not just weighed on shares of Chesapeake, but it has taken down many peers as well. All of this resulted in the shares falling to just $1.70 per share days ago amidst the market turmoil, as insiders made some big bets. Chairman Archie Dunning bought millions of shares in recent weeks, and while his track record can be debated, the signal is pretty big, with holdings now approaching nearly 10 million shares. Appeal Lures Let me put it this way, I am much more constructive on the shares at this point. Shares have lost 50% of their value in essentially two months, and while the market turmoil and lower oil prices have been good reasons for the pullback, reality is that natural gas prices have been pretty solid as of late. Alongside the deal announcement in October, Chesapeake reported third-quarter adjusted profits of $174 million, but these are adjusted profits. The reason for that is simple; lower depreciation charges due to large amortisation charges being taken in the past. Capital spending of $619 million for the third quarter resulted in net capital investments of $345 million with depreciation charges totalling just $274 million. These net capital investments are essentially twice the adjusted profits, which indicates to me that the business remains uneconomical, as there is really no production growth.\\n In the third quarter, realized oil prices averaged $59 per barrel with natural gas realising $2.70 per share. That actually worked down to a roughly equal revenue contribution of about $600 million for the quarter. With crude down 20-25% but natural gas prices up 30%, the net impact is fairly limited to slightly positive at this point in time, although the timing on the \"oil\" play, WildHorse, has been very unfortunate (again). Hence, the net improved realisation in terms of pricing, significantly reduced equity valuation/expectations, and insider purchases are all positive signs for equity investors in my view, although I remain far from a big fan of the company. One does however not have to invest in great businesses, but only in great risk-reward situations. Trading at $2 and change, I am constructive and consider a very modest speculative long position from here, although a real credible road map to sustainable and \"economical\" earnings remains a long road.\\nPlease subscribe to Value In Corporate Events - Marketplace Checkout to obtain premium research on all the latest IPOs, M&A activity and other corporate events.

Thus, they help investors weather short periods of market turbulence and so prevent sleepless nights of worry. This is a look at the most reliable long-term dividend stocks in the world. Dubbed the \"Dividend Aristocrats,\" they have raised dividends for at least five straight years (Canadian firms), 10 years (E.U.-based firms) or 25 years (U.S. companies).

The seventh lowest priced International Aristocrats dividend stock, British American Tobacco (BTI) showed the best analyst-augured net gain of 70.06%. Source: YCharts \\n\\n The five lowest-priced International Aristocrats dividend stocks of December 26 were: Skandinaviska Enskilda Banken (OTCPK:SKVKY); Enagas (OTCPK:ENGGY); Micro Focus International (MFGP)); AT&T Inc. (T); Imperial Brands (OTCQX:IMBBY), with prices ranging from $9.54 to $29.23. Five higher-priced International Aristocrats dividend stocks for December 26 were: Enbridge (ENB); British American Tobacco (BTI); BCE Inc (BCE); WPP PLC (WPP); Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce (CM), whose prices ranged from $29.42 to $73.61. That distinction between the five low-priced dividend dogs and the general field of ten reflected Michael B. O\\'Higgins\\' \"basic method\" for beating the Dow. The scale of projected gains based on analyst targets added a unique element of \"market sentiment\" gauging upside potential. It provided a here-and-now equivalent of waiting a year to find out what might happen in the market.

That\\'s not the case right now because it is trading at a price-to-book value of 5.88x. That is still pretty given the current market conditions. As HDDs (hard disk drives) slowly fade out, Seagate will derive more of its revenues from SSDs (solid state drives), but will it have the same traction as it has in HDDs? The war can heat up sooner than we expect, and there is a large list of names in SSDs that is in a similar position. In the meantime, the inherent volatility may give the stock some ups and downs in the short run, but its stock price could fall significantly in the medium term. Sustaining a yield near 7% is not easy. Furthermore, a higher payout will mean that it will have to sacrifice its research and innovation costs. It is better to seek value elsewhere than to buy into Seagate in the current market situation, as trade tensions, high inventory levels in the industry, and pressure on ASPs (average selling prices) are causing confusion and impulsive trading behavior. \\n\\n Source: Seeking Alpha I feel that Seagate hasn\\'t demonstrated anything significant that indicates that it will continue to enjoy a major share in the SSD markets. Yes, I get it, the price looks cheap, dividends are handsome, and you want a piece of it, but we must not forget that Seagate and firms alike can only survive through innovation. I expect prices of SSDs to come down significantly in the next two years, and why they shouldn\\'t? While SSD prices go down, HDD ASPs will go down at a higher pace (due to the replacement effect). Add to that the increasing cloud preference among corporations for non-volatile memory purposes. When price disparity decreases, Seagate will suffer badly. This is a possibility if the firm doesn\\'t focus on gaining traction on the SSD markets. Seagate has taken a cautionary look at the current pricing pressure and believes that there are other opportunities, which I think will take more time to capitalize and integrate into its products.\\n \\n\\n Source: Stockrow \"Along with the rest of the market, we have increased caution over the near-term pricing environment and we are taking some defensive measures, but believe in our opportunities to grow this area of our business over time.\" -William David Mosley, Seagate. Now, if Seagate is going through a classic cyclical downtrend instead of all these pressures, then also I expect it to trade at lower prices. Before its recent peak in market cap back in July, there was a similar peak at almost same levels back in December 2014. Technical analysis on the long-term trend indicates that the steady climb down is what\\'s happening right now, and there\\'s potential for further decline. If you look at the price-to-book multiple, you will see that earlier in April, the market was pricing in too much value, but the level was very high compared to the last five years. What I mean is that despite the trade war and the industry issues, such a high price was already indicating to us to not get in, but people jumped in. \\n\\n Source: Seeking Alpha Seagate\\'s debt levels are not problematic, yet. Seagate\\'s net debt to last 12-month EBITDA ratio is 1.1 times as of the September quarter. In the December quarter, the firm expects to retire the remaining November 2018 debt of approximately $499 million. The firm expects gross margins for the December quarter to be at the low end of our 29% to 33% long-term range, primarily reflecting the lower demand for nearline HDDs. Seagate\\'s midpoint top-line guidance for the coming quarter is just slightly below its long-term average levels, and I think the firm downplayed just to be able to surprise the market.\\n The memory market is going through some turbulent times. A myriad of technological and geopolitical challenges has put Seagate and a number of similar firms under pressure. I know many people are screaming a buy on Seagate because it is trading low, but I think there\\'s more potential for a greater discount than the current levels. I would suggest looking for value elsewhere.\\nDisclosure: I/we have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

(“GGB”), which aims to acquire Aphria in a C$2.8 billion all-stock deal.\\n        GGB’s second largest shareholder is a fund sponsored by Green Acre Capital, a firm that lists none other than Aphria CEO Vic Neufeld on its board of advisors.\\n        GGB recently listed a current Aphria board member on its own board of directors. Other recent GGB directors have obvious affiliations with Aphria and its related persons.\\n        GGB was formed this year, has almost no revenue or tangible assets, and has limited operations. Despite this, its newly-listed, thinly-traded stock has spiked to a market cap of ~C$890m on average daily dollar volume of only ~$1.3 million.\\n        In short, we think GGB is largely a worthless entity with numerous signs of Aphria related-party influence. This entire proposed deal strikes us as merely an epic next step of Aphria’s brazen shell game.\\n        '], 'article': [\"  Summary: A Highly Irregular Deal  Last we left off, Aphria’s shareholders were patiently waiting for the company’s weeks-delayed “line-by-line, point-by-point” response to our December 3rd research report. In our report, we had identified substantial red flags of insider self-dealing relating to Aphria’s C$280 million LatAm acquisitions.  Rather than releasing a rebuttal however, shareholders yesterday were instead subjected to the newest act in the Aphria circus: A ‘hostile’ takeover offer from a company that quite obviously has numerous related-party links to Aphria and its key insiders.  The bidder, Green Growth Brands, listed on the Canadian Securities Exchange less than 2 months ago via reverse merger, has limited financials, and looks to operate 1 retail cannabis store in the U.S. along with a cultivation and production facility. GGB’s stock has rocketed by about 66% since its IPO on average dollar volume of only about $1.3 million per day.  In sum, GGB strikes us as being a largely unknown, essentially worthless shell that has seen its share price pumped higher on thin trading volume. \\n GGB’s stock closed yesterday with a market cap of about $890 million trading at $4.98 per share, yet intends to acquire Aphria in an all-stock deal at a value of $7 per GGB share. In other words, GGB’s shares would need to be valued at over a 40% premium from its recent closing price in order to buy Aphria at a 45% premium. We believe the deal sponsor and structure are both highly irregular, to put it mildly.   This Strikes Us as a Desperate Attempt to Manufacture The Appearance of Demand  Before we go too deep into the details of this proposed deal, perhaps it makes sense to rewind the clock a bit and provide a theory on what might be happening here.  Our recent LatAm report followed on the heels of our original report from March relating to Aphria’s C$425 million acquisition of Nuuvera. Aphria insiders eventually admitted to having secretly owned stakes Nuuvera prior to its acquisition. Those insiders included 4 top executives (including Aphria’s CEO and CFO) and 6 of 7 company directors. In other words, the scandal implicated nearly the entire board and top management.  Our Nuuvera report was in late March, well after many of the suspicious LatAm shell entities had already been established. Given the timing (and given these latest developments) we believe it is possible, if not likely, that a large swath of Aphria’s executives and board members also had exposure to the questionable LatAm dealings.  So what do you do if almost everyone gets caught with their hands in the cookie jar? The ideal solution would be a buyout with a change of control, which can allow everyone to naturally exit with their reputations largely intact.  But what if no one swoops in to buy you out, given all the recently surfaced problems? Well, you might just take matters into your own hands and try to engineer the appearance of demand by getting your friends to launch a bid for you. Then, reject the ‘hostile’ attempt as being deficient and hope credible offers actually roll in. At the very least it will support the share price and provide a welcome distraction. At most, it might actually work. \\n With that in mind, let’s get into some of the details of the deal.   This ‘Hostile’ Takeover Offer Looks More Like a Related-Party Fakeover  The bidding company, Green Growth Brands, came public less than 2 months ago with Aphria’s quiet backing. We can see this through ownership information aggregated via SEDI. Pay close attention to the #2 holder, GA Opportunities Corp, which owns ~25% of the outstanding equity:  \\n\\n (Source: Bloomberg) Per Aphria’s latest MD&A, we can see that it transferred over $30 million into that very fund subsequent to the recent quarter-end.  \\n\\n  As indicated in the same filing, GA Opportunities Corp. is a fund under the Green Acre Capital umbrella. Per the Green Acre Capital website we see that Aphria CEO Vic Neufeld sits on the advisory board:  \\n\\n  We find it to be a remarkable coincidence that Aphria holds a major stake in its own 'hostile' bidder through a fund that is advised by its own CEO.  A further review of Green Growth Brands’ SEDAR filings show other remarkable coincidences. A filing from just 1 month prior to the reverse takeover transaction shows the directors at the time. Two stand out in particular: \\n \\n\\n  Let’s start with Shawn Dym. If the name sounds familiar, that is because he is a current Aphria director:  \\n\\n  (Source: Aphria) In other words, a recent director of the 'hostile' bidder served concurrently as director of Aphria immediately prior to its recent IPO.  The second individual, Adam Arviv, looks to have a close business relationship with long-time Aphria advisor Andy DeFrancesco, who featured prominently in our reports on both LatAm and Nuuvera. Arviv shows up in numerous DeFrancesco-affiliated deal filings including those in Liberty Health Sciences, Riot Blockchain, PolarityTE, Breaking Data Corp, and MassRoots.  Despite Dym and Arviv having directorship roles at Green Growth as late as October, neither were listed as directors in the subsequent reverse merger documents a month later (pg. 62).  Moving right along, the key backer of Green Growth is the Schottenstein family, which worked with Aphria and its key insiders on a joint venture to bring medical dispensaries to Ohio just one year ago.  \\n\\n   \\n\\n\\n  The joint venture included numerous Aphria insiders who worked together with the Schottenstein family on this deal including CEO Vic Neufeld, director Cole Cacciavillani, director John Cervini, and multiple others.   This Bid Looks to Us Like the Latest in a String of Poorly Disguised Insider Self-Dealings  Is this really a hostile bid? Let’s review and you can decide:   The bidder was taken public mere months ago with the backing of Aphria, and through a fund that is advised by Aphria CEO Vic Neufeld himself. The bidder’s main backer had a recent joint venture with Aphria and its key insiders. The bidder’s recent board members concurrently served on the board of Aphria or had numerous historical dealings with key Aphria-related individuals.   What Is Green Growth Brands? Newly-Formed, Limited Operations, Limited Financials, and a Thinly-Traded Stock That Has Spiked in a Short Period of Time  So what can Aphria’s shareholders look forward to if this all-stock deal were to actually close? Let’s take a look at what Green Growth Brands brings to the table.  Green Growth Brands was formed on February 14th, 2018 (pg. 20). The company IPO’d via reverse merger and opened for trading on November 13th, less than 2 months ago.  Based on recent news releases and the recent investor presentation the company looks to operate one cannabis store in Las Vegas along with a cultivation and production facility. Here is a picture of its cannabis store:  \\n\\n  The company has plans to expand through acquisition and additional store growth in 2019.  For now, it’s financials look rather thin. The latest balance sheet shows tangible assets of about $5 million and liabilities of $58 million (pg. 2)  \\n\\n\\n  The company generated sales of $1.8 million and a $516 thousand loss in the same period:  \\n\\n  Despite the nearly non-existent financial performance and asset base, Green Growth’s stock has rocketed since its IPO despite a widescale decline in cannabis stocks. Most of the spike has taken place in the 2 weeks leading up to the hostile bid announcement:  \\n\\n (Source: BNN) We’re not exactly bullish on Aphria (as we have made clear), but this proposed deal actually strikes us as being objectively worse. Shareholders would be trading Aphria, warts and all, for an inflated stock in an entity with almost no tangible assets or financials. What is the point?   (Meanwhile, Vic Neufeld is No Longer the Chairman of Aphria)  Given all the attention on the proposed bid, you can be forgiven if you had not noticed that Vic Neufeld is no longer chairman of Aphria. Neufeld stepped down almost immediately after news of the takeover offer was released.  The timing of this major release, immediately on the tail of such a headline grabbing bid, strikes us as unusual.   Conclusion: We Think Aphria is Making a Mockery of the Capital Markets  With so much attention on Aphria and its irregular dealings we simply find it to be brazen that this deal has even been put on the table.  We’ll leave it at that for now. (APHA)\\nDisclosure: I am/we are short APHA. I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions. I am not receiving compensation for it.

Respondents indicated a deterioration in local business conditions, as this index fell to -25, its lowest reading on record, but most firms were optimistic that conditions would improve.Survey results suggested employment growth among many manufacturing firms in December, but firms continued to struggle to find workers with the necessary skills. Respondents expected this problem to continue in the coming months but anticipated continued employment growth as well.Both prices paid and prices received by manufacturing firms grew in December.

Well, for one thing, Lehman\\'s failure wasn\\'t a singular event. In the heady days of September 2008, authorities working for any number of initialism agencies were busy trying to put out fires seemingly everywhere. Lehman had to compete with an AIG as well as a Wachovia, already preceded by a Fannie and a Freddie. If Lehman was the personification of everything going wrong, Bear was its precursor where only the one thing seemingly did. In fact, throughout the middle of 2008, policymakers took great solace in what they thought they had achieved; sure, it was bad but only Bear went down, and even then, it wasn\\'t a complete wipeout. The summer of 2008 for offshore markets took on a very different reality, however. The panic was really two panics, the first finishing up around March 2008 merely the set-up for its much more devastating second act (the events in early 2009 could reasonably be considered as the third). Whereas Federal Reserve and government officials took comfort in only the one, Lombard Street took stock. Bear Stearns wasn\\'t some subprime peddler, Chairman Bernanke. But if the opening drama was uncertainty about what was going on, the interlude between March 2008 and that September was deeper thinking about what perhaps waited for everyone in the end if it were to happen again (and to what unappreciated high probability it could). Market participants, it seemed, were willing to cut the official positive narrative some slack, maybe Bear was the worst of it, all the while still concerned that maybe it wasn\\'t. It was a very short lease, a feeling public officials never truly understood. If things really did start to meaningfully improve, so be it; if they didn\\'t, the exits would never be large enough. That\\'s the point about this space between uncertainty and fear, almost a mini-reflation inside a downturn, everyone in the middle begins to worry about the exits no matter how wonderful that initial sigh of relief might feel.\\n The emotional appeal of the sell button (or collateral call) becomes paramount in the second part in a way it never would be in the first. Everyone might still be able to function with care and consideration, deliberate even when they are worried; fear throws all that out the window. If someone punches you in the face out of nowhere, you might hold on and wait to figure out what it was and why. If they throw a second punch, there is no doubt there is only \"fight or flight.\" These things always come in at least the two parts. The \"rising dollar\" period 2014-16 was actually two in which the dollar rose really only during the first one. The former announces serious problems, and then the latter confirms the destructive tendencies. The reactions are pretty distinct nonetheless, a lot more violence and downturn when fear is in control. What happens in the middle is re-evaluation. The more serious the initial blast, the deeper the rethinking goes, such that if whatever is amiss isn\\'t truly handled, it will become the only thing that matters for Part 2\\'s fright. If it comes back, I\\'m gone no matter what. This is the asymmetry of things, there are no gains here. It is therefore an opportunity as well as a warning. It would be, anyway, if authorities weren\\'t always too busy being behind. Policymakers are so self-assured, there is no warning that can wake them from their self-imposed illiteracy. Self-assessment in public doesn\\'t allow for the consideration of small failure in policy let alone the repeated big ones. That\\'s why the economy is always strong and resilient in the middle, only to suddenly turn out very wrong in a very \"unexpected\" way. In May and June 2008, the narrative was one of cautious optimism that the economy might miss a recession altogether. A number of further warnings should\\'ve dismissed the notion outright, warnings that were escalating still despite the dissipation of worry (seemingly) due to Bear\\'s handling. Same in Spring 2015, the Fed on track to \"raise rates\" even though the rest of the world seemed to be captured by invisible monetary conflagration. Warnings proliferated while offshore markets reassessed the exits, a measurement carried out with greater urgency with Yellen\\'s head buried further in the sand astride Bernanke\\'s, which still remained in that position after so many years.\\n In the middle, reassurance reassures no one. Central bankers think it their sole job to do only that. They have devolved into mindless cheerleaders, when during these times of uncertainty, markets demand hard truths and even harder answers. Even the most unaware intuitively understands that oil prices don\\'t crash during \"strong\" economies. \\n\\n That\\'s the big thing about Part 1 - it announced already that something serious is wrong. Denying that fact demonstrates only denial. So, when Part 2 swings back around for whatever reason(s), there are the cheerleaders doing what cheerleaders always do, and exits that for Part 1 seem so awfully, dangerously small and narrow. Uncertainty morphs into fear at the drop of a hat. And yet, even then, a \"drop of a hat\" isn\\'t actually as quick as the cliché makes it out to be. These are all processes that come at us over a period of time, sometimes condensed in memory, if almost never in fact. You can date the second part of 2008\\'s panic to a number of calendar placements, but there can be no doubt the latest was July 15. That\\'s two whole months before Lehman, when LIBOR spreads remained so conspicuously abnormal. Same with 2011 and 2015-16. You might look at the extreme events of May 2010 presaging the even more extremes of July and August 2011 in the same way the last six months of 2015 were foretold by the last six months of 2014. At least in November 2010, the Fed offered up a second QE, not that it did any good (which markets noticed). For a long time now, we\\'ve been writing and chronicling \"uncertainty.\" Where is the dividing line between that and Part 2\\'s outbreak of fear? It\\'s hard to know in real time, especially when the issue is offshore money, these shadow eurodollars of dark leverage. We have a hard enough time trying to figure what\\'s (really) on one bank\\'s balance sheet, let alone all of them collectively.\\n There are, though, a few indications of fear at the end of 2018. One is credit spreads, another is tied to them. Gold and Emerging Market junk bonds don\\'t seem bedfellows, yet they are that and more. Gold keeps signaling rising fear, as do now credit spreads. \\n\\n It is highly unusual for spreads to blow out by 100 bps (in certain indices or comparisons) in a single month. That level of selling in such a relatively abbreviated calendar space is much more difficult to misinterpret. There are a number of technical and fundamental factors that can weigh on credit markets at any given time, but a short, sharp spread blowout of that magnitude isn\\'t going to be related to any of them. Spreads, then, are about only the one thing - the exits. \\n\\n As of Monday\\'s desperate selloff, the BofAML High Yield Master II spread blew out to a total of 106 bps for the preceding month of volatile trading. A bad month like this, as you can plainly see above, is plainly unusual and falls along with exactly the kind of bad associations, economic as well as financial. There are no recoveries and economic booms during these, nor have they followed. As with a whole bunch of other warnings, it all points back to the days immediately following October 3. Something changed; oil had fallen, for example, several times this year, but none of those had triggered this systemically, uniformly negative response. Those earlier declines were watched with a wary eye full of caution and uncertainty, but this last one was met by outright fear.\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n For his part, Jay Powell had an opportunity to put out some of the fire, to keep unease from spreading into the disease of indiscriminate liquidation. He might\\'ve calmed markets (I personally doubt it) by talking about this \"Fed pause\" in mid-September, but remember, he was intoxicated by the BLS figures: wage numbers most of all. Powell\\'s economy was never stronger than during this last middle, the weeks leading up to October 3. The FOMC had all summer between the \"strong worldwide demand for safe assets\" and the first week in October to rethink things most of all this strong economy nonsense. There was everything wrong about May 29 (just as October 15, 2014, or May 6, 2010). Reasonable and rational human beings would\\'ve at least done that. Not policymakers, though, their ideology leads to nowhere other than the profession of cheerleading. Why October 3? I have some thoughts on the subject, in more detail than those I\\'ve expressed before - including those I published on October 2. For now, it sure does seem like the only thing anyone is thinking about is the exits. That\\'s understandable, but I\\'d like to see everyone also think about why history rhymes so very closely. It has a lot to do with why another Part 2 always follows another Part 1. The wasted opportunity of the middle.\\n']}\n"

During the Christmas Eve trading day, just seven ETFs hit all-time highs, none of which was a traditional equity strategy. One of the seven funds delivering some holiday cheer to investors was the Cambria Tail Risk ETF (BATS:TAIL). TAIL tries to provide income and capital appreciation from investments in the U.S. markets while protecting against downside risk, according to a prospectus sheet. The active ETF will invest in cash and U.S. government bonds, and utilize a put option strategy to manage the risk of a significant negative movement in the value of domestic equities, or more commonly known as tail risk, over rolling one-month periods. TAIL\\'s tale of the tape is jaw-dropping at a time of struggles for U.S. equities. The fund is up nearly 10% over the past week, 16.51% this month and 9.34% year to date. The Tale of TAIL\\'s Tape \"TAIL strategy offers the potential advantage of buying more puts when volatility is low and fewer puts when volatility is high,\" according to Cambria. \"While a portion of the fund\\'s assets will be invested in the basket of long put option premiums, the majority of fund assets will be invested in intermediate term US Treasuries.\" TAIL is actively managed. Tail risk refers to the normal distributions beyond three standard deviation, or more skewed distributions. A put option provides the buyer the right to sell the underlying index to the put seller at a specified price within a specified time period. In the event of a decline in the underlying index, the put may help reduce the downside risk. Consequently, the put option becomes more valuable as the underlying market weakens relative to the strike price. Traders who write put options have essentially sold the right to another investor to sell shares at an agreed-upon price. On the other hand, the buyer has purchased the chance to sell stock to the put writer. In other words, the party who writes puts acts as an insurance provider for the portfolio\\'s downside but gains access to premiums, or income.\\n \"As the fund is designed to be a hedge against market declines and rising volatility, Cambria expects the fund to produce negative returns in the most years with rising markets or declining volatility,\" according to the issuer. \\n\\n Original Post\\n']}\n"

The company’s model is attractive to consumers, and the returns on store investments are attractive to investors. This combination of a model that works for consumers and earnings growth alike is why the stock has generated massive returns in recent years. However, the selloff from $136 to under $100 has created another opportunity for investors to own the next leg of growth at a reasonable price; Five Below is a buy once more. \\n\\n Recent results support the bull case The company’s recent results continue to be outstanding as Five Below grows the top line at rapid rates. Total sales were up 21.6% during Q3 as comparable sales added an impressive 4.8%. This has been a staple of Five Below’s results since I began covering the company, and it appears there are no signs of slowing down anytime soon. Indeed, management guided for 3-4% comparable sales growth in the critical fourth quarter, but I suspect we’ll see something higher than that based upon the company’s historically conservative guidance. Margins are expanding as well, albeit slightly at this point. In the first three quarters of the year, gross margins are up 50bps, while SG&A costs have risen only 10bps. That leaves core operating margin up 40bps at 7.4%, but when we add in Five Below’s significant interest income, operating margin comes in at 7.7% this year against 7.1% in the first three quarters of last year. That is meaningful margin growth, and it is helping Five Below produce tremendous earnings expansion even in excess of its very high rates of revenue growth.\\n Long term looks even better We’re all aware of how good Five Below has been, but what about moving forward? There are a lot of things to like about this company, and below I’ll outline some of the key ones I think will move the business forward. First, the company has no debt. Five Below has very impressively managed to grow its store count by leaps and bounds without borrowing to do so. It has $239 million in payables and $85 million in deferred expenses, and that’s it. It also has $188 million of cash and equivalents as well as $340 million in inventory, among other assets, more than offsetting its small amount of liabilities. This company has enormous financial firepower to essentially do whatever it wants even if it never chooses to borrow. Second, it has loads of store growth potential left. \\n\\n (Source: Investor presentation, page 31) Five Below is around 750 stores today with potential for 2,500 or more. That means the company will more than triple its current store base when all is said and done, providing sizable revenue growth for years to come. Indeed, management’s stated goal is 20% revenue growth annually, and it has delivered on that promise. There is no reason to think the days of 20%+ revenue growth are ending anytime soon. Third, Five Below’s track record of growth is almost unparalleled in retail. \\n\\n (Source: Investor presentation, page 24) Sales have expanded at an average rate of 25% in the last five years, operating income is even better at 26%, and net income better still at 30% annually. With the store base expanding as rapidly as it is and significant comparable sales growth, margins should continue to rise over time, thanks to increased scale and leverage on support costs. This is not a new model for a growth retailer to follow, but it doesn’t have to be; everyone knows that it works, and Five Below is following the playbook exquisitely.\\n Fourth, the company’s model resonates with consumers in all income brackets and in all different types of markets. \\n\\n (Source: Investor presentation, page 37) Its customers aren’t just those at the lower end of the income spectrum looking for a deal; people of all means shop at Five Below. In addition, customers tend to shop once a month or so, and Five Below’s model encourages the treasure hunt experience for customers, similar to TJ Maxx (TJX) or Ross Stores (ROST). In other words, consumers don’t know what will be in a Five Below store, so they are naturally encouraged to walk around and browse. That leads to better brand awareness and more revenue. Finally, all of this adds up to a simply unbeatable new store economics model for a retailer. \\n\\n (Source: Investor presentation, page 21) The company’s new stores tend to cost about $300k but return unit-level EBITDA of $450k in the first 12 months. That is an astonishing rate of return, and it explains why Five Below is able to open so many stores without borrowing anything to do so. As the company opens more stores, it produces more and more cash, which then affords it the ability to open more stores. This virtuous cycle doesn’t end when the store goal is reached, however. When Five Below is done growing, all of this excess cash will allow it to pay a dividend and/or buy back stock later in its life cycle, providing shareholders with another long-term avenue for total returns.\\n The stock isn't cheap, but never will be The stock doesn’t look particularly cheap at 30 times next year’s earnings estimate of $3.15 per share. However, consider how much room there is for growth, how much cash the business produces and, indeed, the fact that current rates of growth in EPS are in the mid-20%'s range. That puts the price-to-earnings-growth ratio at just over 1, which is very reasonable for a fast grower like Five Below. I normally shy away from stocks with P/E ratios of 30, but I’m willing to make an exception for this one. I don’t think Five Below will ever get to the point where it looks cheap, simply because it is a best-of-breed retailer. The pullback into the $90s may be the best chance investors get to own perhaps the best growth story in retail in the coming years, and I think investors should take advantage and buy.\\nDisclosure: I am/we are long FIVE.

That the European problem was a demand and liquidity issue, not due to years of excess. The ECB had been receiving tremendous pressure from banks and governments to implement a similar program to the US\\'s quantitative easing, forgetting that the eurozone had been under a chain of government stimuli since 2009 and that the problem of the eurozone was not liquidity but an interventionist model. The day the ECB launched its quantitative easing program, excess liquidity stood at 125 billion euro. Since then, it has ballooned to 1.8 trillion euro. \"Only\" after a 2.6 trillion euro purchase program and ultra-low rates. Eurozone PMIs are atrocious. The eurozone index falls from 52.7 in November to 51.3 in December, well below the consensus forecast of 52.8. More importantly, France\\'s PMI plummeted from 54.2 in November to a 34-month low of 49.3. Unemployment in the eurozone, at 8%, is double that of the US and comparable economies. Youth unemployment rate remains at 15%. Economic surprise has plummeted as the ECB balance sheet reached 41% of GDP (vs 21% of the Fed). More than 900 billion euro of non-performing loans remain in the banking system, which keeps a trillion euro time bomb in its balance sheets (read). A figure that represents 5.1% of total loans compared to 1.5% in the US or Japan. Deficit spending is rising. Government debt-to-GDP has risen to 86.8%. The number of zombie companies - those that cannot pay interest expenses with operating profits - has soared to more than 9% of all large quoted firms, according to the BIS. Sovereign states have saved around 1 trillion euro in interest expenses, but have spent all those savings. Today, almost no eurozone country can absorb a modest rise in interest rates, and Italy, Spain, France, Portugal, Slovenia, and others are demanding more spending and more deficits. There is no real secondary market demand for eurozone sovereign bonds at these yields. At the peak of its quantitative easing program, the Federal Reserve was never the sole buyer of Treasuries. There was always a relative secondary market. In the eurozone, the ECB has been 7 seven times the net issuances of sovereigns. No investor is likely to buy eurozone sovereign bonds at these yields once the ECB steps down.\\n Eurozone growth and inflation estimates have been revised down again in December. Industrial production has fallen sharply. Trichet, the ECB\\'s predecessor to Mario Draghi, had lowered interest rates from 5% to 1% and injected billions into the economy, buying sovereign bonds in 2011. What has the ECB been successful at?  Keeping the euro alive. Not a small success, by the way. The risk of break-up has been contained but not eliminated. Maintaining government spending at low rates. However, at the expense of savers and salaries. Generating a sense of euphoria in financial markets, with high yield and sovereign bonds soaring. Wages in the eurozone have increased below inflation since QE launched and into the third quarter of 2018. In fact, low inflation has been the biggest unintended success of the ECB. It could have been worse. The biggest \"success\" of the ECB has been the massive bailout of governments at the expense of savers.  \\n\\n (Chart courtesy Pictet) We also have to agree that Mario Draghi has been reminding governments that they needed to implement structural reforms and use the period of low rates to deleverage, repeating constantly that monetary policy will not work without reforms. No one listened. It was party time, and cheap money attracts bad decisions. A Never-Ending Government Stimulus With public spending averaging over 46% of GDP, an annual deficit of over 1.7% on average, and 86% debt, talking about austerity is like eating a box of cakes and calling it \"diet\". The tax burden in this period has been raised throughout the EU (with honorable exceptions, such as Ireland) with an average tax wedge of 45% for workers and 40% on companies. The United States, at the peak of the crisis, spent 43% of GDP (the EU, 50%) and dropped it to 34%, and that with 21% of the budget in 2009 dedicated to defense.\\n The EU has been a Keynesian stimulus machine before, through and after the crisis.  A massive stimulus in 2008 in a \"growth and employment plan\". A stimulus of 1.5% of GDP to create \"millions of jobs in infrastructure, civil works, interconnections and strategic sectors\". 4.5 million jobs were destroyed, and the deficit nearly doubled.Between 2001 and 2008, money supply in the eurozone doubled. Two massive sovereign bond repurchase programs with Trichet as ECB President, interest rates down from 4.25% to 1% since 2008. Poor Trichet. Trichet purchased more than 115 billion euros in sovereign bonds. An additional mega-stimulus from the ECB, in addition to the TLTRO liquidity programs with Draghi, which has taken sovereign bonds to the lowest yields in history and purchased almost 20% of the total debt of some major states.  The problem of the European Union has never been a lack of stimuli but an excess of them. As government expenditure and unproductive investments multiplied, overcapacity remains at levels of 20% and the constant errors of interventionism leave the eurozone after the biggest monetary experiment in its history with the same high tax wedge and obstacles to the productive sectors. The end of the ECB QE leaves the eurozone in a weaker position than it was in 2011. Because fiscal space has been exhausted and the ECB, with its balance sheet at 41% of the eurozone GDP and ultra-low interest rates, has also exhausted its monetary tools. The end of QE does not just show the failure of the ECB\\'s policy. It highlights the failure of governments\\' economic policies. Governments should implement growth-oriented reforms lowering taxes and attracting capital. Many will not. Most will likely decide, again, that they need to spend more. Fail, repeat. Disclosure: No positions.\\n']}\n"

It owns strong brands and should analyzed. I analyzed the fundamentals, valuation, opportunities and risks.While the company has growth prospects and strong fundamentals, the macroeconomic risks and the high valuation make it rather unattractive to me.'], 'article': [\"Introduction At the moment, my portfolio suffers from lack of exposure to consumer staples companies. The companies in this sector have suffered from the recent pullback, and even before, they underperformed as a sector. I intend to take advantage of this pullback and try to find suitable investments in this sector to supplement my dividend income. Moreover, consumer staples names, while not as glamorous as companies from other sectors, enjoy strong demands even when the economy slows down. If you think the economy is slowing down, you may consider a more defensive approach for your portfolio, and you should do it by looking at consumer staples companies. I always look for companies with strong brands that are well-positioned to weather a storm if one approaches. Diageo (DEO) is one like that. It has a range of well-known brands and offers an addictive product that people tend to consume regularly. I analyzed the company using my graph as shown below. My analysis found Diageo to be a very well-run company with strong pricing power and financial fundamentals. It will have to deal with several risks soon, mainly Brexit, and together with the rich valuation, I find it not too appealing now. \\n\\n (Graph created by author) Diageo produces and sells alcoholic beverages worldwide. It offers a collection of brands across the spirits, beer, cider and wine categories. Its brands include whiskeys, vodkas, beers and more alcoholic beverages. The company also provides adult beverages and non-alcoholic products. Diageo is headquartered in London, the United Kingdom.\\n \\n\\n (Source: Diageo) Fundamentals I expect to see low- to mid-single digit growth over the long term from companies in this sector. These companies are mature, and their expansion is rather slow. They compensate with their stability and lower volatility. DEO fits this description, as it shows slow revenue growth over the past decade. The core growth is more impressive, since the weak British pound and the strong US dollar hurt the company's top and bottom lines. \\n\\nDEO Revenue (TTM) data by YCharts The EPS figure is more impressive, growing by more than 60% over the past decade. This figure was also hurt by the strong USD, but the company managed to achieve more from every dollar it earned on the top line. In the medium term, investors should expect DEO to keep growing its bottom line in the mid-single digits, which will propel the continued growth of the dividend. \\n\\nDEO EPS Diluted (TTM) data by YCharts The dividend as seen in the graph below looks erratic, but this is only because of the different way European companies pay dividends. DEO pays the first payment in the middle of the year and the final payment at the end of the year. The payments are in GBP, so due to currency exchange rates, it sometimes looks like the dividend is decreased. The dividend is safe with payout ratio of just a little more than 50%, and the current yield is just over 2.5%.\\n \\n\\nDEO Dividend data by YCharts DEO also returns money to shareholders in the form of share buybacks. The current annual program will buy shares worth up to 2 billion GBP. The buybacks allow the company to decrease the number of shares outstanding and support the growth in EPS. They also increase the stake of every shareholder in the company. I appreciate when companies combine buybacks and dividends to reward shareholders. Valuation The valuation is the weak point of DEO, in my opinion. Despite the weakness in the markets lately, its valuation doesn't seem attractive. The trailing P/E is over 22, and even the forward P/E ratio is higher than 20. As a rule of thumb, I look for companies with a P/E ratio lower than 20. The growth rate of DEO doesn't justify this valuation, in my opinion. A look at this graph from F.A.S.T. Graphs shows a similar picture. While the price dropped a little bit, the valuation is still higher than the average valuation. Because of the rich valuation, we can see that there has been almost no movement in the share price over the past couple of years. The price will either stay the same until the fundamentals catch up or we will see it declining even more. \\n\\n (Source: F.A.S.T. Graphs) To summarize the fundamentals and valuation, I would argue that while DEO has strong fundamentals and the company shows healthy growth, the valuation doesn't match the fundamentals. The company is priced for perfection, and the past results don't justify the price. The only reason to consider DEO at these prices is if it has impressive growth prospects.\\n Opportunities One of the largest growth opportunities for DEO is the wide array of well-known brands. These brands not only enjoy strong demand, they also serve as an entry point for new brands that the company offers. The combination of well-known brands with luxurious brands allows DEO to offer a diversified portfolio in every market that it operates. \\n\\n (Source: Diageo Investor Presentations) The company offers well-known brands, and it also offers a variety of alcoholic beverages. From beer to vodka and whiskey, DEO can offer a product to everyone looking for alcoholic beverages. Moreover, DEO uses its size to operate worldwide, and only a third of its sales come from North America. It allows the company to be less correlated with the United States and enjoy growth in emerging markets. \\n\\n (Source: Diageo Investor Presentations) Unlike other companies that serve addictive products such as tobacco, DEO enjoys growing markets. Earth's population is growing, and as more people around the world can afford leisure drinks, the potential for the company is very impressive. In addition, unlike tobacco companies, alcohol doesn't suffer from such horrible PR and the limitations on it are not as vast. \\n\\n\\n   (Source: Diageo 2017 Annual Report) Risks The first risk is the fact that the dividend is paid in GBP and not in USD. It is a risk to the whole concept of dividend growth investing. Investors who look for dividend growth can find themselves with decreasing payments in USD. The instability right now in the United Kingdom may cause additional currency fluctuations in the short and medium terms. Moreover, the United Kingdom is leaving the European Union in a process called Brexit. It is very complicated and requires never-ending negotiations within the UK and between the UK and the EU. The effect of the Brexit on the British economy can be harsh. Economists suggests we may see growing inflation and even a recession. DEO is based in the UK, and Brexit's aftermath will have its effect on the company. I also believe that the company still lacks some diversification. It is highly diversified within the industry, but not within the sector. Companies like Altria (MO) try to reach other industries within the sector. Altria has stakes in alcoholic beverage and cannabis firms that are meant to diversify its revenue stream. DEO doesn’t have this diversification, and while it allows the company to focus on its core business, this also leaves it more vulnerable to changes in consumer tastes or regulations. Conclusions DEO is a great company. It owns a wide array of strong brands and can offer a great product to every client. It also enjoys strong financial fundamentals and treats its investors with growing dividends and a share buyback program. However, I am concerned with the current valuation. When the market is a little soft and interest rates in the United States are climbing, I find it hard to justify this. While the company does have growth prospects that will propel growth in the future, there are also some significant risks. Brexit alone should impact the valuation, in my opinion, as the level of uncertainty is very high. I don't see how the current valuation fits the risk profile and the growth rate, and therefore, I will wait for a more attractive entry point.\\n\\nDisclosure: I am/we are long MO.

They still don\\'t realize that the economy was never strong. They confuse a bubble for strength. Without 0% rates and QE the bubble can\\'t survive. But a return to those policies kills the dollar\" - Peter Schiff on Twitter I made that same argument about the Fed funds rate, the dollar and why the Fed has to keep \"nudging\" the Fed funds rate higher in a podcast conversation with James Anderson at SilverDoctors last week. Wednesday\\'s 1000-point spike up in the Dow may have been the largest one-day point gain in the Dow, but it was far from the largest percentage point gain. The two largest percentage point gains occurred in October 2008: an 11.08% gain on October 13, 2008, and a 10.88% gain on October 28, 2008. Those two days took the Dow just above 9,000. A little more than four months later, it closed at 6,626. Wednesday\\'s market action was nothing more than evidence that the Fed\\'s Frankenstein has gone off the chain... Despite official prevention efforts, two-way price discovery has been introduced to the stock market. The Establishment, lazy, entitled and fattened-up on the 10-year stock bubble, has gone into convulsions over the possibility that the stock market will do anything but move higher. The Wall Street Journal published an article blaming the Christmas Eve stock market massacre on the algos. Even well-seasoned market veterans like Leon Cooperman were whining about the two-way price action and the role of HFT-driven hedge fund algorithm trading. Where were these cries of distress when the market was driven relentlessly higher by QE-armed algos over the past 10 years? Some chart \"experts\" have labeled the market \"extremely oversold.\" But the stock market has been extremely overbought for the better part of the past 8 years. By what measure is the market \"extremely oversold\" in this context? Looking at a monthly chart of the SPX going back to 1999, the MACD was at its most extreme overbought by far at the beginning of 2018.\\n But the current sell-off has barely moved the needle on the monthly MACD. It\\'s nice to draw symmetrical geometric shapes and lines which are fit to charts ex post facto (i.e., Monday morning armchair QB). But the fundamentals beneath historically overvalued financial assets are cratering very rapidly. The drop in stocks since early October has done little to correct the extreme condition of overvaluation - aka \"the bubble.\" Using real numbers to calculate preferred valuation ratios used by \"analysts,\" rather than manipulated government GDP/inflation and phony GAAP numbers used by these \"analysts,\" the overvalued condition of the stock market is the most extreme in history. A coordinated Central Bank-engineered bounce is to be expected, and certainly, there\\'s extreme political pressure in the U.S. for this. But more intervention preventing true price discovery merely defers the inevitable rather than fixing the underlying systemic problems. Furthermore, as evidence of the market\\'s reaction on Monday after reports hit the tape that the Treasury Secretary (head of the Working Group Group on Financial Markets) was convening the CEOs of the six biggest banks to discuss the market sell-off, official intervention serves only to signal to the markets that something is profoundly wrong with the system, contrary to official propaganda. Wednesday\\'s 1000-point price spike reflects a completely dysfunctional stock market. Just like the big moves in October 2008, it also foreshadows a much steeper sell-off coming. The story did not end well for Shelley\\'s Frankenstein. Neither will it end well for the Fed\\'s creature. It\\'s going to get a lot more painful for those who have been conditioned to believe that stocks only rise in price.\\n']}\n",

It is hard to imagine that Micron\\'s stock can consistently trade at a 50% discount off the fair value estimated by the majority of the Street\\'s analysts. So, it may be time to recognize that there are several non-company-specific reasons driving Micron\\'s stock price movements. It should be noted that CEO Sanjay Mehrotra\\'s \"tariffs will have a 50-100 bps effect on gross margin,\" \"the excess supply may be resolved within 2-3 quarters,\" or the company\\'s $10 billion stock buyback plan may not be enough to affect stock prices either in a meaningful or permanent way. But these factors will continue to be impactful into 2019. Taken as a commodity stock, Micron\\'s stock price has moved in concert with the DRAM/NAND 4-year price cycle more so than with forward revenue and EPS. The prevailing short thesis that Micron is just another commodity stock subject to a cyclical downturn may be the reason that MU has dropped from a recent high of $61 at June to the current low of $30s. In this post, I estimate how low Micron\\'s price may go from the perspective that the stock is predominantly affected by the DRAM/NAND price trends at least in the near term.\\n Micron Stock Cycle and DRAM/NAND Cycles As both DRAM and NAND prices are invariably determined by the demand and supply of the memory chips due to the cyclical nature, the demand has been long estimated to be weak after 2019. There is further indication that the production efficiency will increase the bit growth in the near term, including Korea\\'s exports. The net impact is that both DRAM and NAND prices are ready to start their two-year downward leg of the cycle. Amid expected softening of commodity prices, both Samsung (OTC:SSNLF) and SK Hynix (OTC:HXSCF) have recently announced they will reduce supply. However, due to the near-oligopoly memory industry, it does not guarantee that several firms reducing supply will automatically increase prices. Micron\\'s Stock Prices Top Later Than DRAM Prices As Micron\\'s revenue is 70% exposed to DRAM and 26% to NAND chips, its stock prices follow a similar DRAM/NAND cycle which follows a long four-year cycle (Figure 1A and Figure 1B). However, in the way how stock and commodity prices are related, the good news is that Micron\\'s stock price is also more predictable in that the stock price tends to top after the topping of the commodity prices. In Figure 1A and 1B, MU\\'s tops (H1 and H2 in black) tend to occur sometime after DRAM\\'s tops (H1 and H2 in red). The lag time is about 6-9 months. The price lag is considered an attractive investment property because MU prices will still go up long after DRAM prices topped out. Micron\\'s stock enjoys a longer upside. It also suggests that the stock price may be affected by other factors than commodity prices. A similar lagging relationship can be observed between MU prices and NAND spot prices (Figure 1B). \\n\\n\\n \\n\\n The fact that Micron\\'s stock is lagging DRAM prices at the top of the cycle demonstrates an advantage that investing in commodity stocks may provide a better risk-reward ratio than investing in the underlying commodity directly. When DRAM price drops due to excess supply, the resulting lower average selling prices (ASPs) also stimulate more demand for the commodity due to the downward sloping demand curve. Micron\\'s bit growth (quantity) will increase to offset some of the negative effects on revenue from the lower ASPs. In fact, Micron\\'s revenue and stock prices have been rising even if the DRAM prices or ASPs already came down, while bit growth still increased (Figure 2A and Figure 2B). It was not until recently, March 2018, that both ASP and bit growth trended downwards. Only when investors factored in the expectation that after both ASP and bit growth will slow down, as early as in March, MU\\'s stock prices started to drop. In other words, bit growth has been helped to delay the negative impact on revenue from the softening commodity prices. \\n\\n \\n\\n Micron Prices Bottom First At this juncture, it should be comforting to see that Micron\\'s stock prices tend to bottom off (L in black) long before the DRAM\\'s price bottoms (L in red). There is some indication that Micron\\'s stock price tends to lead at the low about 2-3 months, a shorter lead time period than the lag time at the top. As a typical DRAM cycle has been somewhere between three and four years long, the downward cycle usually corresponds to a recessionary economic cycle, which reduces the demand. When DRAM is close to the end of the downside leg, the bit growth will already slow down or even in a downtrend. The source of the lead time near the low point may be a result of the forward-looking nature of the stock prices. Different from the point near top, investors are more concerned with the timing when the DRAM price will bottom, and less with the timing of when bit growth will reverse. It should be clear that quantity adjustment in bit growth tends to lag the price movement. In both cases, Micron\\'s stock prices react more to DRAM prices than to bit growth\\n This is an important piece of historical pattern if it can be explained by economic intuition. After Micron\\'s stock prices lost more than 50% since the last high about $65, investors are extremely anxious in looking for any signs that stock prices are bottoming. Thus, based on the historical lead-lag relationship between MU\\'s stock price and the DRAM price, I will be able to estimate the next low point of Micron\\'s stock price if the next low point of DRAM prices can be identified. As the market has worried about a looming recession, Micron\\'s stock prices have started to factor in the weak demand of DRAM/NAND in 1H 2019. Analysts have predicted that the NAND price will decline by 10% and DRAM price will decline more in 1H 2019. As a result, I was able to estimate that MU\\'s prices may hit a near-term \"bottom\" around $25 (Figure 3), assuming the same historical cyclical pattern (the dotted lines in Figure 3). \\n\\n Takeaways The prediction of Micron\\'s near-term bottom around $25 should be read with multiple warnings. At this point, my contention is that the fundamental stock valuation becomes least relevant because MU\\'s stock has been traded at a near 50% discount relative to the fundamental fair values for a prolonged period. Although it may be compounded by the recent trade war, the main source of the bearish sentiment has been from Micron\\'s commoditization, which has been predicted and debated long before the trade war came into the picture. As it is almost impossible to predict the political outcome and the timing of the trade war resolution, it is still informative to estimate the long-term impact of the DRAM/NAND price cycle on Micron\\'s stock price cycle. The bottom line is that barring any major surprise out of the 90-day trade talks, Micron\\'s stock price may see a bottom around $25 in the first quarter of 2019.\\n\\nDisclosure: I/we have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

On December 20, open interest for Cboe S&P 500 (SPX and SPXW) options surpassed 21 million for the first time ever in its history of more than 35 years and hit a new all-time record high of 21,424,148 contracts, and The Cboe S&P 500 95-10 Collar Index (CLLSM), an index that tracks the performance of a strategy that buys SPX puts for protection and sells SPX calls for income, rose 2% in 2018 (through December 20).  Charts on Record Open Interest for S&P 500 Options The chart below shows that open interest for Cboe\\'s S&P 500 options rose from 1.1 million in 1993 to 16 million in July 2018, to a record 21.4 million contracts on December 20. \\n\\n Recent Comments from Traders and Portfolio Managers In the past week I spoke with a number of traders and portfolio managers to inquire about their thoughts about the growth to record open interest in S&P options. The responses I heard included -  \"Higher volatility levels in recent months make the markets more attractive for options sellers who wish to generate more premium.\" \"Cash-secured put-writing has gained more mainstream acceptance\" \"There is more interest in portfolio protection and generation of income\" \"There is more trading in SPX call spreads. Look at SPX call open interest which has been beefed up by the sheer quantity of multi-legged call trades that have been trading to hedge the other tail. Millions of calls since the Sept 21st expiry!\" \"We are seeing SPX volatility sellers with some big multi-leg positions\" \\n Year-to-Date Performance and Mitigation of Losses with CLL Index The chart below shows that \"traditional\" key benchmark indexes for large-cap US stocks, small-cap US stocks, emerging markets stocks, Treasury bonds and commodities all fell in 2018 (through December 20), but that the Cboe CLL index rose 2% in the same time period. \\n\\n The Cboe S&P 500 95-10 Collar Index (CLL) is an index designed to provide investors with insights as to how one might protect an investment in S&P 500 stocks against steep market declines. This strategy accepts a ceiling or cap on S&P 500 gains in return for a floor on S&P 500 losses. The passive collar strategy reflected by the index entails:  Holding the stocks in the S&P 500; Buying three-month S&P 500 (SPX) put options to protect this S&P 500 portfolio from market decreases; and Selling one-month S&P 500 (SPX) call options to help finance the cost of the put options.  The term \"95-110\" is used to describe the CLL Index because (1) the three-month put options are purchased at a strike price that is about 95 percent of the value of the S&P 500 at the time of the purchase (in other words, the puts are about five percent out-of-the-money), and (2) the one-month call options are written at a strike price that is about 110 percent of the value of the S&P 500 at the time of the sale (in other words, the calls are about ten percent out-of-the-money). The starting and base date for CLL Index is June 30, 1986, at which it was priced at 100. The CLL Index is designed to be a valuable resource for investors who want to explore ways to manage their portfolio risk in bear markets. SPX Skew Chart Shows Higher Implied Volatility for OTM Puts The volatility skew chart below shows estimates for implied volatility (y-axis) for S&P 500 options for the Monday, Wednesday and Friday expirations (dates in legend at left) and at various strike prices (in x-axis). Note that the implied volatility estimates for many of the out-of-the-money (OTM) S&P 500 put options range from 22 to 110, while the implied volatility estimates for many of the S&P 500 call options range from 15 to 40, a much lower range. One could infer from this chart that there probably is quite a bit of strong demand for downside protection with use of the OTM puts. In addition, in recent years, many investors have seen the performance of the Cboe S&P 500 PutWrite Index (PUT) and become more comfortable with the idea of selling cash-secured puts on the S&P 500.\\n \\n\\n Disclosure: Copyright © 2018 S&P Dow Jones Indices LLC, a division of S&P Global.

Click here to find out more »\\nWill Quantitative Tightening Wreck the Markets? Recently, there has been a flurry of posts and opinions claiming that the application of quantitative tightening (QT) is draining liquidity at a rate that is clamping down on investments in securities and provoking the recent stock market correction. This Federal Reserve policy and its possible effects are the topics of this piece. Before I dive into this controversial topic, I should point out that I am long equities, and have changed my investing strategy over the past year or so. I did not own individual stocks until a few years ago. I began to sell and buy individual securities; while some of the selling had rhyme and reason, I fell into a trading pattern without realizing it. This cost me in anxiety, commissions and mixed investing results. I realized that I needed to sharpen my strategy, that there was too much risk in my portfolio and that I needed to reduce the trading. I used the first part of this latest, second correction of 2018 to replace or reduce some high-yielding stocks with more middle-of-the-road securities. I have replaced an excess of trading and market timing moves with a buy-and-hold approach generally. Like most investors, I am troubled by the depth of this latest correction. But I have not panicked, and in fact have not reduced the percentage of stocks in my portfolio (it also includes two bonds). What is Quantitative Easing?\\n Quantitative easing (QE) is an expansionary monetary policy conducted by central banks for the purpose of stimulating the economy and increasing available liquidity. The banks accomplish QE by buying preset quantities of government bonds and additional assets. Quantitative easing is sometimes used in periods of low inflation and when standard means of expansionary money policy have proven ineffective. \\n\\n Source: CNBC | Giorgio Tonella. Figure 1: A Representation of QE Quantitative easing is implemented when those banks purchase assets from commercial banks and other institutions. These purchases raise the price of those assets while lowering their yield. They also cause a reduction in short-term interest rates – increasing the money supply. (This is not the same as the central bank buying short-term government bonds to control interbank interest rates.) More information on QE is available here and here. In fact, the failure of short-term bond purchases to lower rates may provoke the central banks to try QE as an alternative to stimulate the money supply. Buying assets without referencing the attached interest rates and purchasing risky or longer maturity assets will lower interest rates further out on the yield curve. While quantitative easing can help ensure that inflation does not fall below a defined threshold, it may at times provoke unwanted inflation. QE may also be ineffective should commercial banks remain reluctant to lend and borrowers to borrow. Most views of the US Federal Reserve’s easing since the global financial crisis of 2007-08 conclude that this application of this specific monetary policy has been somewhat effective. This massive effort was the first of its kind and is believed to have helped stir the stock market to new heights in the ten years since the crisis. Many observers now make a direct connection between the central banks regularly buying assets and across-the-board increases in stock prices. Concurrently, the success of QE may have helped plant the seed for the use of quantitative tightening (QT) to reverse its effects.\\n What is Quantitative Tightening? Quantitative tightening (QT), the opposite of QE, is a policy intended to contract the money supply and reduce the liquidity within an economy. The primary purpose of QT is to raise interest rates so as to reduce demands for goods and services and to prevent inflation. Another side purpose may be to cool off the hot stock markets and prevent a stock market bubble that might be precedent to a harmful crash.  As with its opposite, QE, quantitative tightening on a mass scale is a new central bank endeavor. This makes it an untried experiment with impact and consequences yet to be explored. A full explanation of QT is found at here and tight monetary policy is elaborated on here. Its premises are sound, assuming the Federal Reserve is right that the environment has become inflationary and that cooling off corporate and personal spending is an appropriate policy. That is, the tightening will likely have at least some of the effects desired. Whether it is necessary to slow down the rise in markets, whether a bubble was on the creation, and whether the reduced liquidity might lead to a bear market and a recession are open questions whose answers also belong to the universe of quantitative tightening’s effects. Economic and Market Factors in Relation to QT A number of factors are present in the economy and markets at any time – and also during quantitative tightening. Economic growth rates are a measure of the performance of the overall economy. They may also speak to corporate health and profit levels and may relate to the fortunes of individual companies. That is, economic growth is to a considerable extent the sum of corporate performance lubricated by government expenditures (these are funded by taxpayers or in some cases not funded at all). If economic growth is strong, then both the economy and the markets can tolerate a reduction in liquidity. A strong economy might overheat – a motive for measures to quiet inflationary pressures. Quantitative tightening is one primary instrument for achieving that.\\n According to the Trading Economics: The US economy advanced an annualized 3.4 percent on quarter in the third quarter of 2018, slightly below earlier estimates of a 3.5 percent growth, final figures showed. It follows a 4.2 percent expansion in the previous period which was the highest since the third quarter of 2014. This matches figures from the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis. It looks very much as if the Federal Reserve sees signs of continuing overheating, a view consistent with the latest rate hike, the guidance for 2019 and the reliance on QT as a strategic tool. The risk is that Powell’s evaluation of both the strength of the economy and the risks of inflation are exaggerated or wrong; if so, then QT will contribute to squeezing economic growth and make it harder for companies to sell goods and make profits. The practical result is to build in \"silent\" rate hikes by rolling assets off the government books. The effects on stock prices will likely be negative as a result. Inflation is a specific factor in the evaluation that seems to have an \"overweight\" effect on the Fed’s decision. There seems to be an emotional component to fears of inflation – based perhaps on periods in which it has damaged overall economic prospects. This may have caused Jerome Powell and the Fed to overreact to mild inflation and exaggerate the threat in implementing QT. \\n\\n Source: Trading Economics, BLS. Figure 2: Inflation Through 2018 The impact of tariffs on the American and international economy (and the two are interwoven) is part of the economic forecast. Whether the Federal Reserve calculates the impact of tariffs is not clear; in any case, it is a very difficult to attempt to do so given the uncertainties around the level of tariffs. Even if the levels were somehow known, their effects on the economy are uncertain. Economic history reveals that tariffs and protectionism harm economies over time, so if the Fed relates to this issue it should argue against quantitative tightening.\\n Federal Reserve Rate Hikes and QT In hiking the interest rate another 0.25 basis points last week and estimating that it would raise twice in 2019, The Federal Reserve under Mr. Powell made a statement that the markets heard as resoundingly negative. Given that this Fed meeting occurred during a sharp correction – the second of the year – the decision accelerated the \"sell\" momentum. The selling since the Dec. 19 announcement has accelerated to the point that the U.S. markets teeter right on the edge of a dreaded bear. The markets had \"hoped\" for just one rate hike next year, and the fact that Powell spoke of unknowns that might influence the decision regarding 2019 did not calm the markets. The doves were disappointed, and the chairman’s polite taskmaster tone did not help matters. Then there was Powell’s statement at the Fed’s press conference about quantitative tightening itself: We came to the decision that we would have the balance sheet run-off on automatic pilot and use rate policy as the active tool of monetary policy. I don’t see us changing that. This no doubt was the kicker that set equivocating traders to sell. It was a perfect trifecta: one more rate hike for 2018, and two promised tentatively for 2019 against the hopes of the markets and a rigorous defense of quantitative tightening. Rate hikes might be reduced if the data indicated, Powell clearly implied. QT is “the active tool of monetary policy” – and set in stone. An unchangeable fact of monetary policy. The markets reacted as they should if we factor in the known investor psychological drivers: fear and greed. Conclusions While withdrawals from stocks and mutual funds have accelerated and are occurring at a much higher rate than the Fed’s monthly asset sale, it looks clear that the results of this past week’s Fed meeting provoked mass selling. A triple dour message of another hike, two more raises next year and a reiteration of QT as a permanent facet of monetary policy is helping drive stock prices down. Of course, there are additional factors including year-end selling, hedge funds apparently closing, the ongoing trade skirmish with China, likely recession in Europe and in China, and US political instability featuring evolving chaos around the Trump administration, its relations with Congress and the Mueller investigation.\\n There is enough bad news out there, and there is the precedent of an early-year correction. It is my guess that few people predicted a second 2018 correction, and now that it is here the psychological effects on investors are exacerbated. True understanding of the effects of the quantitative tightening will take time. History is not written in the present. It appears that QT, married with continued rate hikes and the macro factors mentioned, present a major challenge for the markets. You can tell investors all about valuations and forward PE ratios, but in the end emotions rule many involved in the markets. QT is at the heart of an austere monetary policy, and in the larger sea of uncertainty, it creates a negative dynamic for the markets in the short and perhaps medium term. In the longer run, investors should not interpret current Fed monetary policy as institutionalizing a permanent bear market. Because of the correction, valuations of many individual stocks have come down to quite reasonable levels. The U.S. economy is not in recession and displays no signs of entering one; nor do likely recessions in Europe or Asia necessarily \"infect\" the powerhouse American economy. It may well be that the current correction is becoming a bear market. If so, then quantitative tightening will have played its role. However, the pressure on the Fed from the administration and the markets, and Jerome Powell’s statements implying flexibility regarding future interest rate hikes, may at least stop the interest rate hikes. In the meantime, the market is in distress and the pain may linger. If this situation eventually leads to a relaxation or reduction in the intensity of QT itself, that would be a likely trigger to a market rebound and a resumption of the long-term bull.\\nDisclosure: I/we have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

In one of my earlier articles I wrote, WHLR can chase their current portfolio, plugging the holes when tenants leave, juggling the creditors and trying to squeeze out a few dollars in additional revenue. However, they are starting from a point where the dividend is not covered and as a general rule, portfolios decline with time. Over time, tenants move or default, buildings get older, and capital is needed to repair, replace or renovate. With WHLR being so short on capital, it is unlikely that they can actively renovate and add value to their current properties.  While WHLR did surprise me with the JANAF acquisition, at the cost of issuing more WHLRD shares at a huge discount, their legacy portfolio has continued to decline. That decline led to the common dividend being eliminated, struggles in retiring and refinancing debt and now the preferred dividends have been suspended.  In my opinion, WHLR is a case study in how not to run a public REIT. It is overleveraged, owns sub-standard quality and routinely makes very poor decisions.  Share prices really collapsed after WHLR announced they are suspending the preferred dividends. This has created a situation where investors have an opportunity to profit, if WHLR resumes dividend payments on the preferred, there should be significant upside.\\n Maturity Issues \\n\\nSource WHLR\\'s most pressing issue is dealing with their near-term maturities. This screenshot is from their quarterly supplement, showing the maturities they have through 2019. Since the end of Q3, there are a few modifications. The First National Bank and Lumber River loans have both been extended 24 months, and will now be due October 2020.  The Monarch Bank Building has been sold, paying off the loan and the remaining proceeds were applied to the Revere Loan. The Revere Loan was extended to February of 2019, with an interest rate increase to 10% and a balance of $1.26 million. So for Q4, WHLR owed $1.369 million for the Senior Convertible Notes, $477k for Harbor Point and $6.25 million on Perimeter Square. I believe that WHLR could refinance Harbor Point, though it is possible that refinancing Perimeter Square could require a partial paydown.  The real issue for WHLR arrives in Q1 of 2019. I believe that paying off the Revere loan is a necessity and top priority for WHLR. Additionally, I believe that Key is putting pressure on WHLR to pay off the $3.83 million overdraw that is due in February. That means WHLR has until February to come up with $5.09 million. Followers of WHLR will remember that KeyBank has a contract as a \"third-party advisor\", and there is little doubt that Key had a strong hand in advising that WHLR suspend the dividends. Key has been very patient and cooperative with WHLR, but it is likely they are looking to take some chips off the table as we approach a potential bear market.  In the conference call, David Kelly identified some pending sales, Further, we have two additional assets on the contract and two others with the letters of intent for sale. They include an undeveloped land parcel in Tulsa and an unanchored strip center in South Carolina as well as an undeveloped outparcel in Richmond and an unanchored strip in Tulsa. We anticipate that these combined sales will generate sales proceeds for approximately $9.2 million. \\n WHLR was hoping to use the proceeds from those sales to pay off their Q1 debts. The most likely cause of the preferred dividend suspension is that one or more of those sales were delayed or canceled.  The Preferred dividends are $3.2 million/quarter. So simply skipping one quarter will be enough to pay off most of the February maturities. The additional $1.89 million should not be too difficult for WHLR to come up with.  The only remaining significant debt maturing in 2019 is Rivergate and the $48 million KeyBank Line. They should be able to refinance Rivergate, they purchased it for $32 million in 2016 and it remains 97.5% occupied. The KeyBank Line can be extended one more year contractually.  That means that if WHLR can meet their February maturities, they will not have any more pressing maturities for 2019. Once they have disposed of the February maturities, there will be little reason for them to continue the suspension of the preferred dividends. I would expect that by Q2, the preferred dividends will be paid again because the preferreds are cumulative and WHLR will not want that obligation rising.  Opportunity It appears to me that WHLR\\'s suspension of the preferred dividends is due to the short-term needs of retiring the Revere loan and paying off the overage of the KeyBank loan. Both of those should be dealt with in February, if not sooner.  With WHLRP trading below $8 and WHLRD trading below $10, they are yielding 28% and 22%, respectively. I believe the market is being overly pessimistic about the prospects of the dividend returning. The shares of both could easily double when dividends are resumed.  The main reason that WHLRD is trading at a higher price is that there is a step-up provision that will raise the dividend by 2% of the liquidation preference annually starting September of 2023. Due to the punishing terms, it is likely that WHLR will attempt to redeem the Series D before that date. Additionally, WHLRD has a minimum asset coverage test, that requires asset coverage of 200%. If WHLR falls below the coverage test, the cure is that they have to redeem Series D shares until the test passes. This is the provision that is currently being disputed by JCP Partners, who claim that WHLR is already in violation. \\n Those features certainly deserve some premium, however, in an extreme event like liquidation or bankruptcy, the shares are on even ground. Any steps towards redeeming the Series D should be immediately beneficial for the B as well, since that will free up more cash-flow for the B dividend. The current premium of 27% for the D is too high. Previously, the premium was in the 10-15% range. Risk The largest risk for WHLR remains disposing of the Series D in 2023. The obligation is currently $90 million, and it is difficult to see how WHLR can come up with that much cash.  In terms of debt, once WHLR has paid off Revere and the Senior Convertible Notes, all of their debt is single property mortgages except for the $3 million National Line of Credit and the KeyBank line. The only entity that could really force a bankruptcy would be KeyBank, and to date, they have shown no indication that they have a desire to do that. With a position as a third-party advisor, Key has a lot of insight and leverage with WHLR. Their loan is secured by numerous properties, so Key likely has a lot more to gain from a controlled refinancing of the properties that still secure the line and a gradual repayment. Until the rubber hits the road and the Series D has to be dealt with in 2023, I consider the risk of bankruptcy or a forced liquidation to be quite low. 2023, could be another question entirely.  The big risk on the preferred level is that during a liquidation there is little reassurance that the preferred shares would get anything at all. Their debt to asset level is at 70% and overall, rent has declined through their portfolio. If properties started going to the auction block, the preferred shares would only get the crumbs of what is left over after the secured debtors and expenses are paid. In my experience, properties being liquidated often sell for less than theoretical market value. There simply is not enough cushion to be confident that there would be anything meaningful leftover at the preferred shareholder level. \\n In a bankruptcy, preferred shareholders would be facing a best-case scenario of becoming the new common shareholders and a worst-case scenario of liquidation with little to nothing. There is definitely a real risk that an investment here, held through 2023, could end up a big fat zero aside from any dividends collected.  Conclusion I am still not a fan of WHLR. It is a poorly ran REIT that has dug its own hole in the ground. But even trash can have value. With the suspension of the preferred dividends in a market that already has a bearish mood, WHLR has sent the preferred shares issuing to a level that makes garbage smell like a rose.  The suspension is very likely due to the February maturities, and the funds saved will be enough to pay off a substantial portion of those. Even if we assume that the properties under contract never close, WHLR should have enough to pay off their immediate maturities and then they do not have anything that will be problematic for the rest of the year. WHLR should be able to reinstate the dividends by Q2. If the property sales are only delayed, or WHLR can sell the properties to a different party, then the cash issues will be resolved even more quickly and WHLR should be able to not only resume dividends but also to catch up on the missed dividends.  The big risk for the preferred shares is that there is likely little to any value if the company were to liquidate. I cannot envision a liquidation in the near future since WHLR should be able to manage their upcoming maturities with relative ease. 2023 is the big year where WHLR\\'s fate will be determined. I have no intention of holding that long. Instead, I intend on taking advantage of Mr. Market\\'s overreaction and expect to have a profitable exit opportunity within a year.

turbulence in the stock market.Today, I analyze the negative impact that volatility can have on a diversified portfolio  and discuss solutions to the problem.I find it prudent for most investors to (1) keep a\\xa0diversified mindset and (2) not rush to try and catch the falling knife.'], 'article': ['Some of us, investors and analysts, might be young enough to have only heard and read about erratic behavior in the markets. After nearly 10 full years of a largely seamless and paced march forward, we seem to have finally entered a new cycle in the world of stocks: One of intense volatility, which so many of us nearly forgot has been a common phenomenon throughout history. \\n\\n Image credit This Wednesday was a particularly unique trading day. The S&P 500 (SPY) ended the session up an astonishing 5% on an apparent lack of meaningful developments. In percentage terms, this was the index\\'s 18th largest daily gain since 1950 at least, and the most robust one-day spike since the end of the Great Recession. Almost comically, news channels identified President Donald Trump\\'s bullish tweet about stocks as one of the main reasons for the rebound - as if savvy investors and professional money managers had \"seen the light\" after scrolling through their Twitter feed this morning. The harsh reality is that volatility is a normal feature in market corrections. I remind the reader that Wednesday\\'s rush in equities was not even strong enough to offset all the combined losses from the previous four trading days (it came about three percentage points short of accomplishing this goal). Rather than looking at the recent spike as a sign that the bear market may be coming to an end, I believe it\\'s much more indicative that the path forward is likely to remain bumpy and adrenaline filled.\\n The destructive power of volatility Volatility is a very meaningful factor to consider in investment strategy, particularly in the case of a diversified, multi-asset class portfolio. Think of the classic 60/40 approach, for example, in which 60% of one\\'s holding are allocated to stocks and the other 40%, to long-term treasury bonds. Further, assume a hypothetical scenario No. 1, in which both equities and bonds produce minimal volatility in the high single digits (measured as one annualized standard deviation). Under these assumptions, the total portfolio should move very smoothly during the period, and returns should not bounce around much. Neither asset class should exert undue influence on the performance of the overall portfolio. The 2016-2017 period is a good example of such an environment. The graph below illustrates the performance of $10,000 invested in a 60/40 portfolio (blue line) from January 2016 to December 2017. Over the period, and even though bonds took a bit of a hit in the latter part of 2016 as yields started to rise (yellow line), the total 60/40 portfolio produced robust results:  Annual return of 12% vs. the S&P 500\\'s 17% and Treasuries\\' 5% Annual volatility of only 5% vs. the S&P 500\\'s 8% and Treasuries\\' 10% Correlation of only 0.6 with the S&P 500  \\n\\nSource: Portfolio Visualizer Now, assume scenario #2 in which stocks are very volatile - say, annualized standard deviation well above 20%. The 60/40 portfolio, despite being relatively well balanced on the surface, will likely swing rather wildly because the underlying assets will tend to toss it around quite a bit. In this case, the correlation between the 60/40 portfolio and broad equities, I hypothesize, should approach 1.0.\\n Here, 1987, the year of the infamous Black Monday, is a good real-life example to be analyzed. Again, the graph below illustrates the performance of $10,000 invested in a 60/40 portfolio (blue line) from January 1987 to December 1987. Over this more bearish and volatile period of time, the 60/40 portfolio did not perform as well:  Flat annual return (i.e. zero) vs. the S&P 500\\'s +3% and Treasuries\\' -3% Annual volatility of 19% vs. the S&P 500\\'s 30% and Treasuries\\' 10% Correlation of 1.0 with the S&P 500  \\n\\nSource: Portfolio Visualizer What to do about volatility My key observation here is that, for a balanced portfolio to have better \"storm-resistant\" characteristics (i.e. be better protected against sizable losses and maintain its diversification features), it must try to avoid too much exposure to volatility. Easier said than done, one might say. But volatility has an interesting characteristic that\\'s worth taking a closer look at. The graph below might seem confusing, but it conveys the very important concept that volatility tends to ebb and flow as waves. Once an asset class like stocks enters a period of high volatility, it tends to stay there for a bit, until the skies clear and volatility disappears for a while. In other words, volatility tends to be cyclical. Back to the graph below, it depicts the relationship between annualized daily volatility in the S&P 500 at a given month (y axis) and the volatility levels in the previous month (x-axis). To be more precise, a \"month\" here is defined as a rolling 22-trading day period, and the data set goes back all the way to 1950. For simplicity, I limited the graph area below to the upper bounds of 40% on both axes in order to zoom in on the relevant data (in rare cases, over the past 68 years, volatility reached the high double-digit levels).\\n \\n\\n Notice that a month of high volatility usually precedes another month of high volatility (farther right end of the graph). The opposite also is true: A lower volatility month usually precedes another low volatility month (farther left end of the graph). The relationship is broken every once in a while, particularly when the wave of volatility comes or goes. The correlation between the volatility in a given month vs. the volatility in the previous month is a surprisingly high +0.7 - which one can easily see in the form of a generally upward-sloping fitting line cutting through the scatter plot above. What to do about portfolio allocation So, how can one apply the information above to his or her portfolio strategy? Considering that (1) avoiding volatility seems like a sensible objective in order for a diversified portfolio to have better storm-resistant properties, and (2) near-future periods of high (or low) volatility appear to be relatively easy to extrapolate from recent data, I believe that active investors might be well served by allocating their portfolios dynamically to reflect the current volatility environment. Here\\'s a simple, viable system to minimize exposure to the roller coaster ride:  Monitor the annualized volatility in the stock market\\'s daily returns at the end of each month If volatility is substantially higher than its historical average, rebalance the portfolio by reducing its allocation to equities, if lower, dial up the allocation Repeat the process for other asset classes within the portfolio, including bonds, gold and others  The S&P 500 has experienced annualized volatility of 13.2% since 1950. For example, and to keep the process simple, consider a dynamic allocation system in which exposure to stocks is dialed down every time the S&P 500\\'s trailing-month volatility breaches 20% by the end of the month. The approach would have resulted in a less equity-heavy portfolio in the early stages of the 2008 recession and again by the end of October 2018. The graph below depicts the moments when a portfolio would have shifted to being over- (green dots) or under- (red dots) exposed to stocks since the start of 2008.\\n \\n\\n Source: DM Martins Research, using chart from Yahoo Finance Please note that paying attention to and acting upon the swings in volatility is not necessarily a system intended for timing the market. Instead, I propose that the main objective of trying to reduce volatility whenever possible is to protect a diversified portfolio from behaving too erratically or from having too high correlations with specific asset classes (the S&P 500, for example). This can be particularly important during times of uncertainty, like the one that we seem to be undergoing currently. Last few words In the end, I bet this Wednesday\\'s rebound must have felt like an overdue relief to many investors who had seen their nest egg lose 20% or more in market value since the beginning of the fourth quarter. Yet, I find it highly speculative to assume that this could be the beginning of better days to come. Instead, I find it more likely that we will continue to see large swings in stock prices, up as well as down, until the correction cycle runs its course. For as long as this is the case, I find it prudent for most investors to (1) keep a diversified mindset and (2) not rush to try and catch the falling knife. On my end, I have been preparing for this bear market for a while and will do what I can to maintain my investment diligence through the turbulent times. \\n\\n\\nNote from the author: The topics discussed in this article are central to my investment philosophy.

Boeing And The Hedged Portfolio Method Over the summer, I wrote about the performance of a bulletproof, or hedged, portfolio built around a position in AT&T (T) last year and presented a new one. Like AT&T, Boeing (BA) tends to attract conservative investors, so I thought it would be interesting to try the hedged portfolio approach with BA this time. As we did last time, we\\'ll use the Hedged Portfolio Method to build a concentrated portfolio around Boeing. We\\'ll start with these premises:  You have $500,000 to invest. You are unwilling to risk a drawdown of more than 9% over the next six months, so you want to be hedged against any decline greater than that. You want to invest in a handful of names, including Boeing, with a goal of maximizing your expected total return net of hedging costs.  Here\\'s a recap of the steps involved, if you want to do this manually. Step 1: Estimate Potential Returns The goal of this step is to find names that have the potential to generate high total returns to include alongside BA - whether those returns come partly from dividends or not isn\\'t relevant (tax considerations aside). My site, Portfolio Armor, calculates its own potential returns by analyzing total returns and option market sentiment, but you can derive yours from Wall Street price targets or the price targets given by Seeking Alpha contributors you follow, if you like. Your initial universe can be as big as Portfolio Armor\\'s (the ~4,500 stocks and Exchange-Traded Products with options traded on them in the U.S.), or something smaller, such as the Dow 30.\\n Step 2: Calculate Hedging Costs Since you\\'re going to hedge, gross potential returns are less important to you than potential returns net of hedging costs. To figure those out, you need to figure out the optimal or least expensive way to hedge each name. We wrote about how to find optimal hedges here. For this example, you would be looking for the cost of hedging against declines of 9% or greater. The lower the decline you\\'re looking to hedge against, the narrower the list of names you\\'ll be able to use. Step 3: Rank Names By Net Potential Return For each of the names in your initial universe that has a positive potential return, you\\'ll want to subtract the hedging cost you calculated in Step 2 to get a net potential return. Step 4: Buy And Hedge Here you simply buy and hedge a handful of names that had the highest potential returns net of hedging costs. The automated approach we\\'ll show below includes a fine-tuning step to minimize your cash, but these four steps are the basics. An Automated Approach Here\\'s how the process looks using my site\\'s automated hedged portfolio construction tool. First, we enter \"BA\" in the optional tickers field, along with the dollar amount we\\'re looking to invest ($500,000) and the maximum decline we\\'re willing to risk (9%). \\n\\n Screen capture via Portfolio Armor. After clicking \"Create,\" we see the screen below, where we\\'re asked if we want to enter our own potential return for BA. That\\'s optional, so I leave it blank. \\n\\n\\n Screen capture via Portfolio Armor. And then click \"Create,\" and see this message, while the system is processing. \\n\\n Screen capture via Portfolio Armor. After a few moments, we\\'re presented with this hedged portfolio: \\n\\n \\n\\n Screen capture via Portfolio Armor. In addition to Boeing, the site selected AngloGold Ashanti (AU), The Direxion Daily Energy Bear 3X (ERY), Spirit Airlines (SAVE), Starbucks (SBUX) and Twilio (TWLO) as primary securities, based on their net potential returns when hedged against >9% declines (I realize the presence of ERY may surprise some readers, for an elaboration of why Portfolio sometimes includes bearish exchange-traded products its hedged portfolios, please see this article). The site attempted to allocate roughly equal dollar amounts to each of those names, but rounded down the dollar amounts to make sure it had round lots of each stock. In its fine-tuning step, it selected Crocs (CROX) to absorb cash left over from the process of rounding down the primary securities. CROX is hedged with an optimal, or least expensive, collar with a cap set at the current seven-day (annual) yield of the Fidelity Government Cash Reserves money market fund (FDRXX). The hedging cost of this is negative: The idea here is to get a shot at a higher return than cash while lowering the overall hedging cost of the portfolio and limiting your downside risk in accordance with your risk tolerance (to a drawdown of no more than 9%).\\n If you\\'re curious why there are so few positions in this portfolio, the short answer is that hedging obviates the need for more and enables a winning position to have a larger impact on portfolio returns. For a longer answer, this article offers an elaboration and an example. Note that each of the primary securities is hedged with an optimal collar. Here\\'s a closer look at the Boeing optimal collar (screen capture via the Portfolio Armor iPhone app): \\n\\n Portfolio Armor\\'s hedged portfolio construction tool tries hedging each primary security with both an optimal collar and optimal puts, estimating the net potential return both ways, taking into account the historical incidence of outliers. Essentially, the lower hedging cost of collars is weighed against the chance for higher upside when hedging with puts. In this case, due to current market conditions, the optimal collar won out for all of the primary securities. Portfolio Characteristics Here\\'s another look at the data summary at the bottom of this portfolio: \\n\\n The Worst-Case Scenario The Max Drawdown is the worst-case scenario. That\\'s what would happen if each of the underlying securities went to $0 before their hedges expired (the idea is to hold each position for six months or until just before its hedge expires, whichever comes first). In that case, you\\'d be down no more than 8.54%. The Best-Case Scenario The best-case scenario is the net potential return of 10.29%. That\\'s what you\\'d get, net of the hedging costs, if each security hit its potential return, which is unlikely.\\n A More Likely Scenario Historically, actual returns average about 0.3x our site\\'s potential returns. The expected return of 3.75% takes that into account, along with the hedging cost. The odds of hitting that number on the nose in a particular portfolio are slim, but, on average, the actual returns tend to track fairly close to expected returns. Wrapping Up - How This Portfolio Differs Each week in my Marketplace service, I present five portfolios to subscribers with dollar amounts ranging in size from $30,000 to $2,000,000. This portfolio differs from ones in my Marketplace service mainly in that I let Portfolio Armor pick all the securities for the portfolios in my service, unlike here where I foisted Boeing upon it. Let\\'s check back in a few months and see how this one is doing.\\nTo be transparent and accountable, I post a performance update for my Bulletproof Investing service every week.

While a number of them were repetitive items like the expiration of the U.S. tax credit coming in a matter of days, one interesting tweet piqued my attention in regards to Tesla in Europe. The tweet seen below seems good at face value, but those that don't follow the name might not know the full history behind this item. So why should Elon Musk be trusted now? \\n\\n(Source: Elon Musk Twitter page, seen here) Expanding the supercharger network is an important step for Tesla, but the company has often lagged in its promises. As I pointed out a month ago in a previous article, Tesla was supposed to be at 10,000 supercharger stalls by the end of 2017, and the company fell well short of that. A new goal was set for 18,000 at the end of this year, but the latest data shows the company not even at two-thirds of that number with just a few days left in 2018. For now though, let's just focus on Europe. The Model 3 is not yet available on that continent, but Tesla has opened up the order book for several countries. A bear might wonder if Elon Musk's tweet today talking about covering all of Europe was an effort to boost a poor conversion rate from deposits to orders. Also, take a look at the three maps below, which might surprise you if you haven't read some of my previous coverage of the name. \\n\\n(Source: Tesla Supercharger site, seen here)\\n The map on the left shows the European supercharger map during the summer of 2016, while the middle one shows where the company expected the network to be by the end of that year. You will notice that a number of the locations, like Turkey mentioned in today's tweet, that were supposed to be operational by the end of 2016 still aren't there two years later. So we are supposed to take Elon Musk's word now? Interestingly enough, the tweet from Elon on Wednesday reminds me of a similar one from a couple of months ago. As you can see below, the CEO realized that the company's service network was not where it should be, and he stated the goal would be to fix this issue rather soon. Service has always been a trouble point for Tesla, and with the Model 3 hitting the road in numbers that are much larger than the S/X ramps, this key issue can get much worse rather quickly if not fixed. \\n\\n(Source article: Tesla Waking Up Too Late, seen here) It has been two months and 10 days since that service tweet was issued. How is Tesla doing on this front? Well, I would say not good right now. If you take a look at the company's U.S. service page, for example, only 3 new locations have opened in this two plus month period (going from a total of 75 to 78). In fact, only 25 U.S. states have service locations according to this site, assuming you don't include China as a US state. Remember, Tesla has already cut its capital expenditures forecast twice for this year. The company also doesn't expect to spend too much over that capex amount in the coming years either, despite numerous vehicle and other major products supposedly in the works. Now I don't think many consumers will consider it reasonable to have to go to another state to get their vehicle serviced. In fact, there are several large states that only have one location, meaning consumers may have up to a 4-6 hour drive to get to their nearest service center. This essentially means that Tesla needs to open up in 25 new states in just a matter of three or so months, which seems about as likely as the company's other service page that says 100 new locations are opening this year. As a point of reference, only 21 had been opened in the first 9 months of 2018.\\n In the end, Elon Musk wants consumers to believe that Tesla will be covering all of Europe with its superchargers by the end of 2019. Of course, this is the same CEO that had to settle a huge lawsuit for tweeting that a deal was in place to take Tesla private, along with many other previous statements that were not true. Tesla was supposed to be covering many of these European locations by the end of 2016, but we're still waiting, just like we are to see the major service network expansion. Perhaps he's trying to boost orders now that the European order book has opened, just as the U.S. tax credit is about to be halved. Right now, VIN data isn't looking good for the Model 3, as the Bloomberg model shows production having topped out and about to fall off a cliff. As a result, I'd take Elon Musk's latest statement with a grain of salt. \\n\\n(Source: Bloomberg Model 3 tracker, seen here) Author’s additional disclosure: Investors are always reminded that before making any investment, you should do your own proper due diligence on any name directly or indirectly mentioned in this article.

It also plans to buy back $2.5 billion in shares during 2019.'], 'article': [\"Marathon Petroleum Corporation (MPC) owns 21%, or one million barrels per day (BPD), of Mid-Continent and Rockies refining capacity. While its operations remain steady as it integrates Andeavor, it's experiencing both seasonal winter product decline and the pressure of lower stock market momentum. So although the company benefits more than ever from discounted crudes, it also offers a heightened dividend yield of 3.2% at its current stock price. Brief Company Summary  Marathon Petroleum is based in Findlay, Ohio, and employs about 44,000 people full time. With a Dec. 26, 2018, closing stock price of $58.35/share, its market capitalization is $40.3 billion. The company has a total of 3 million BPD of refining capacity in sixteen U.S. refineries. The company divides into three segments: Refining, midstream, and retail marketing. Much of its midstream is contained in two separately-traded limited partnerships. It sells petroleum products to wholesale customers, to the Speedway business segment, and to independent retailers operating 11,000 outlets, including Marathon, Arco, and several other brands. With the acquisition of Andeavor, Marathon Petroleum now has controlling interest in two midstream partnerships: MPLX LP (MPLX) plus Andeavor Logistics (ANDX). Both limited partnerships continue to trade separately from MPC stock. Oil Prices and Differentials West Texas Intermediate-Cushing Oil Price, $/barrel \\n\\n\\n Left axis: $/bbl, credit: market.businessinsider.com The Dec. 26 closing oil price was $46.94 per barrel for West Texas Intermediate (NYSE:WTI) crude oil at Cushing. While this is an increase of 10% in one day, as the chart shows the level is dramatically lower than early October prices that reached more than $75/barrel. Lower oil prices are a boon for MPC. Since not all oil is the same, and Marathon benefits from localized factors, a description of differentials is useful: *The Brent price is the non-US light crude price and closed today at $54.06/bbl, or about +$7/barrel higher than WTI-Cushing. *WTI-Midland is the same crude, but at the transport-constrained location of Midland, Texas. For January 2019 WTI-Midland oil trades -$5.70/bbl less than at Cushing, or at $41/barrel. *Bakken, or Clearbrook, has the same density and sulfur quality as those above, but is produced in North Dakota crude and traded at the Clearbrook, Minnesota hub. Its differential varies depending pipeline availability in North Dakota and Canada. Currently Bakken crude is -$1.75-$4.75/barrel lower than WTI-Cushing, so about $42-$45/barrel. *(WCS) is Western Canadian Select, used in Canada, but also exported to the U.S. Due to transportation constraints even more severe than in the Permian, the WCS price is -$20/barrel less than WTI-Cushing, or $27/bbl. The differential has been as much as $52/barrel. Given these large differentials, it's advantageous for Marathon Petroleum to have good access to Bakken and WCS for its 10 inland refineries. The Crack Spread and Refining Profitability The trend in the 3-2-1 crack spread, a measure of refining profitability, is shown below and is currently about $15.50/barrel. However, while this number is defined as three barrels of crude subtracted from the sum of two barrels of gasoline and one of distillate, the specific crude used for this calculation is WTI-Cushing. Companies like Marathon that can use less expensive crude as feedstocks will net larger profitability.\\n\\n\\n Credit: energystockchannel.com Since winter is an off-season for petroleum product demand, seasonal slumps in earnings and prices, let alone the entire stock market downdraft, make refiner stocks like Marathon Petroleum more of a bargain than in the summer high season. Competitors The barriers to the US refining industry remain high due to siting issues, the large, fixed cost of capital assets, a domestic market that's not increasing, and a regulated, consumer-facing gasoline business that's highly competitive and much scrutinized. All of Marathon Petroleum’s three MMBPD of refining capacity is domestic. Valero (VLO), its neck-and-neck competitor, has 3.1 MMBPD of capacity, but with a refinery in Wales and one in Canada Valero’s domestic capacity is 2.625 MMBPD. Total U.S. refining capacity is 18.6 MMBPD, so Marathon Petroleum’s share is 16% to Valero’s 14%. In the MidContinent and Rockies, Marathon Petroleum’s major competitors include BP (BP), HollyFrontier (HFC), Phillips 66 (PSX), and Valero. On the Gulf Coast, Marathon’s competitors are virtually every U.S. refiner, since most own at minimum one Gulf Coast refinery.  Marathon Petroleum’s Oil Refineries and Operations  With the acquisition of Andeavor, Marathon Petroleum operates 16 refineries having a total capacity of 3 million BPD. Ten of these refineries are inland. The remaining six include two large 550,000-plus BPD refineries in Texas and Louisiana, one refinery in Alaska, refineries in northern and southern California, and a refinery in Washington state. Marathon’s coastal refineries in Louisiana and Texas also are able to receive waterborne crude from around the world. \\n\\n Garyville, Louisiana refinery, Credit: marathonpetroleum.com\\n Growth Prospects In third quarter news the company explained it's starting to consider combination synergies for ANDX and MPLX. And in the December 2018 investor-day presentation, Marathon Petroleum said it could raise gross run-rate synergy potential by up to 40% to $1.4 billion. In terms of diversification, the company's executives explain that non-refining segments contribute more than 50% of EBITDA. Thus, they are not totally reliant on refining margins, aka crack spreads. For 2019, the company plans $2.8 billion of capital spending yet expects to return more than 50% of discretionary cash flow to investors, implying share repurchases of $2.5 billion. Marathon Petroleum’s Financial and Stock Highlights Marathon Petroleum’s market capitalization is $40.3 billion at a Dec. 26, 2018, stock closing price of $58.35 per share. The company's trailing twelve months’ earnings per share is $8.12, giving it a 5.3% return on assets, a 22.2% return on equity and a bargain trailing price-earnings ratio of 7.2. The average of analysts’ estimated earnings per share (NYSEARCA:EPS) for 2019 the next 12 months are $7.64, a decrease of 6%. Marathon's third quarter 2018 net income was $941 million, with net income attributable to MPC of $737 million or on a diluted per share basis $1.62. Nine months’ net income is $2.4 billion, with $1.8 billion attributable to MPC. The table below shows operational income by segment, in millions. In early 2018, some assets were contributed from the refining and marketing segment to the midstream segment and $230 million of income is reflected in the midstream rather than the refining and marketing segment, where it would have been in 2017. The remainder of the drop in quarterly refining and marketing results were due to lower crack spreads, partially offset by wider U.S. and Canadian crude differentials.     3Q18 3Q17 9M18 9M17   Refining & Marketing 666 1097 1558 1589   Speedway 161 208 415 581   Midstream 679 355 1863 996   At Sept. 30, 2018, the company had $33 billion in liabilities and $53 billion in assets, giving Marathon Petroleum a liability-to-asset ratio of 62%. Its ratio of current assets divided by current liabilities is 1.65, comfortably above the desirable minimum of 1.0 and thus a positive.\\n Its most recently reported operating cash flow was $6.2 billion and its levered free cash flow is $2 billion. With an enterprise value (NYSE:EV) of $58 billion, its EV/EBITDA ratio is 9.1, so below the preferred ratio of 10 or less. Marathon Petroleum’s 52-week price range is $54.29-$88.45 per share, so the Dec. 26, 2018 closing price of $58.35 is 66% of the one-year high. The company’s one-year target price is $99.94 per share, putting its closing price at only 58% of that level. \\n\\nMPC data by YCharts Marathon Petroleum pays a dividend of $1.84 per share, a yield of 3.2% to its now-lower stock price. Overall, the company’s mean analyst rating is a 1.5-1.9, or between “strong buy” and “buy,” from the 19 analysts who follow it. The most recent rating change — occurring today — was Standpoint Research initiating at “accumulate.” At Sept. 30, 2018, Marathon Petroleum’s largest institutional stock holders were Vanguard with 7.8%, State Street with 5.3%, BlackRock with 4.6%, Boston Partners with 2.8%, and Millennium with 2.6%. Marathon Petroleum’s beta is 1.61, representing steeper volatility than might be expected for such a large company but reflective of the dual, and not reliably synchronized, uncertainties of oil prices and petroleum product prices. Logistics Partnerships Marathon Petroleum's two master limited partnerships, MPLX LP and Andeavor Logistics LP, have combined market capitalization of $32.8 billion: $24.4 billion for MPLX and $8.4 billion for ANDX. The assets of both are mainly pipelines and terminals. Attractiveness of partnership shares are specific to an investor’s tax situation and are not evaluated in this analysis. However, Marathon Petroleum operationally integrates the partnership’s assets with its refining assets.\\n Governance Institutional Shareholder Services ranks Marathon Petroleum’s overall governance as an 8, with sub-scores of Audit (2), Board (9), Shareholder Rights (9), and Compensation (1). Approximately 1.4% of the outstanding stock is shorted, a decline from the level of 7.8% two months ago. A Note on Valuation The company’s book value per share of $33.63 is about 60% of its current market price, showing that market value of Marathon Petroleum’s assets is higher than its depreciated base and indicating investor optimism. Positive and Negative Risks Potential investors should consider their oil and petroleum product price expectations (and thus, refining margin) as the factors most likely to affect Marathon Petroleum. Marathon is advantaged with a diversity of sources and positive exposure to lower-priced inland U.S. and Canadian crude oil supply. However, the company’s governance score is quite weak. There's also the risk of distraction as Marathon adds the operations of Andeavor, itself a premier refiner. Recommendations for Marathon Petroleum Potential investors should factor the company’s weak governance score into their decisions. I continue to recommend this well-run largest of the U.S. oil refiners to investors interested in both growth and yield. Stock market downdrafts have reduced its price and thus increased its dividend yield. The company has identified growth synergies in its combination with Andeavor and in the two limited partnerships. Marathon has a history of improving refinery operations, notably of the large Galveston Bay refinery, which speaks to its ability to integrate the Andeavor refineries successfully. Its access to incredibly low-priced Canadian crude as well as discounted Bakken and Permian crude will strengthen refining profitability. Market timers will want to note that it is not unusual for refiners’ results, and stock prices, to swing up during the spring and summer since summer is peak gasoline season.\\n\\n\\n\\nWhile you're here, consider subscribing to Econ-Based Energy Investing, a Seeking Alpha Marketplace platform by a veteran energy investor that draws from a group of more than 400 public companies.

The Fed is expected to continue raising rates going into next year according to its own projections, which is providing support to short-term yields, but is putting pressure on longer term yields such as the 10yr yield due to increased fears that a hawkish Powell may end up inducing a recession at some point in the future. While the Fed monetary policy is one important component that influences Treasury yields, the level of debt issuance by the Treasury department is also a crucial aspect.  Fiscal deficit is rising The US government’s fiscal deficit increased by 17% to $779 billion in Fiscal Year 2018, which runs from October 2017 to September 2018. This widening in the deficit has been due to Trump’s tax cuts, which did not raise tax revenue as much as expected. Revenues only increased by $14 billion, whereas expenditure grew $127 billion due to increase in military spending, social security and Medicaid. This widening deficit forces the US Treasury to issue more debt, and is projected to issue $1.34 trillion in treasuries in 2018, which marks a 146% increase from 2017. Moreover, analysts are estimating that Trump’s tax cuts will continue widen the deficit even further over the years to come. Hence this means that the government will have to continue issuing more debt to fulfill its duties. This increase in supply of treasuries in the market will put downward pressure on treasury prices, and consequently will push yields higher.\\n More specifically, the government relies heavily on the issuance of treasury ‘notes’, more than bills and bonds, to finance its activities. ‘Notes’ refers to those securities that have maturities anywhere between 1 and 10 years. Below I have collated data relating to outstanding treasuries presently, and is demonstrated in the pie chart below.  \\n\\n\\n\\nData Source: SIMFA Not surprisingly, the government has been issuing more treasury notes over the past few quarters to continue making up for the fiscal gap. Below you can find treasury issues for the third quarter of 2018. \\n\\n\\n\\n Source: Bloomberg 3yr and 10yr notes make up the bulk of the issues. Assuming this trend continues over the coming years, this section of the yield curve could experience rising yields as the government continues to widen its deficit.\\n Fed unwinding balance sheet On top of increased debt issuance from the government, another important factor to keep in mind is the fact that the Fed is in the process of unwinding its balance sheet that it had built up in response to the crisis. The Fed currently holds about $2.24 trillion of US Treasuries on its balance sheet, and the weighted average maturity of its holdings is about 8 years. The Fed currently allows $50billion worth of bonds to “runoff” its balance sheet every month, out which $30 billion is US Treasuries (the rest is MBS). This unwinding also increases the supply of treasuries in the market, which will put further downward pressure on prices, and allow yields to move higher. While there is hope among market participants that the Fed may decide to slow down, or even halt, its process of shrinking the balance sheet next year to address the slow down in the economy, which could ease the supply pressure in the market, do note that the unwinding of the balance sheet will be a very long process that will take years to normalize. Hence while there could be temporary delays in the unwinding of its balance sheet, the Fed is certainly aiming to bring down the size of its balance sheet overtime. Thus the absence of demand from the Fed absorbing debt securities will definitely push prices lower and support yields higher. Demand for Treasuries Other than the Fed, other major buyers of US Treasuries include financial institutions and global central banks. In fact, foreign investors hold about $6.2 trillion in US Treasuries, and provide the largest demand for such securities. However, the demand from overseas has been cooling off lately, in part due to a strengthening US Dollar and higher hedging costs. While demand could recover if the USD weakens next year, this dampened foreign demand for debt securities raises concerns over whether markets will be able to absorb the excess supply overtime.  Though keep in mind that US Treasury securities still offer the best yields among developed nations. For instance, the 10yr German Bund currently offers a mere 0.25% yield. Hence it will be hard for fixed-income investors from around the globe to shy away from US Treasuries given its comparatively attractive yields.\\n Furthermore, fears of an upcoming recession are mounting as the US economy, together with the global economy, is slowing down. In times of recession and financial market turmoil, investors prefer to allocate capital towards safe haven assets such as US Treasuries. Hence, the markets may be better able to absorb the excess supply over the near term amid a risk-off sentiment. However, over the longer-term, if the growing supply US Treasuries is not met with growing investor appetite, we could witness prices moving lower and yields surging higher. Bottom Line With the US government issuing more debt to address the widening budget deficit, and the Fed seeking to unwind its balance sheet over the long term, the supply of US Treasuries will grow over the years to come. If demand does not match up to the increasing supply, then investors should expect bond prices to decline and yields to rise over the long-term, which is a factor to keep into consideration when making investment decisions.\\nDisclosure: I/we have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

While DTN has benefited from its exclusion of the Financials sector, the fund continues to under-perform both the broader market and alternative dividend funds. This is partially because the fund\\'s top sector is Energy, which has performed even worse than Financials over the course of the year. Looking ahead, as oil prices continue to slide amid rising supply from the United States, I do not see a scenario where we see a significant, and lasting, price rebound in the short-term. This means the Energy sector will likely continue to see pressure. Furthermore, while DTN\\'s yield has risen due to the share price drop, the fund\\'s dividend growth lags alternatives, suggesting better options are out there. Finally, I expect the Financials sector to rebound next year, which is a trend DTN will not capitalize on (if that does materialize). Background First, a little about DTN. The fund is managed by Wisdom Tree and seeks \"to track the investment results of high-dividend yielding companies outside the financial sector in the U.S. equity market\". DTN currently trades at $91.59/share and offers monthly income with a current yield of 3.56%, based on its last twelve distributions. I covered DTN back in August, and recommended investors avoid the fund. In hindsight, that turned out to be the right call. While the market as a whole is indeed down substantially, DTN has fallen more sharply, and is down roughly 19% since my review. While this large drop certainly would have some investors considering buying in on hopes of a rebound, I believe better options than DTN exist going forward, and I will explain why in detail below.\\n Energy Was Worst Performer in 2018 A primary reason why I am not bullish on DTN is because of the fund\\'s top sector by weighting, which is Energy. While I am generally optimistic that every sector will see a rebound in early 2019, this is largely due to the fact that I believe the recent stock market drops are simply too far, too fast. Therefore, I expect Energy to see a short-term bounce, but at a pace slower than many other sectors, which makes investing in those companies not ideal in the near term. To put Energy\\'s difficulties in perspective, year-to-date performance for all market sectors are listed below, which shows Energy as the clear loser in 2018: \\n\\n Source: Bloomberg I highlighted the Financials sector as well to show that DTN\\'s exclusion of those companies likely did help the fund in isolation. However, Energy\\'s drop has been so significant, it seems to have negated that effect. Looking ahead, I wanted to evaluate the sector to see if out-performance in 2019 was likely, or if the under-performance is bound to continue. Unfortunately, I see Energy struggling for quite a while, for a couple of reasons. One, while the slide in oil prices is wreaking havoc on the sector in the second half of this year, oil is actually not down much in a year-over-year comparison, as illustrated in the graph below: \\n\\n Source: U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) What this tells me is that the drop is not entirely unjustified, as oil has traded at these levels over the past year, suggesting the current level is one that oil could trade at for some time.\\n Two, a principal reason for this price drop has been the oversupply issue facing the oil market, due largely to increasing production out of the United States. Importantly, according to data from the EIA, this production has been rising steadily for years, illustrated in the graph below: \\n\\n Source: EIA My takeaway here is that, even if U.S. supply levels off in the near-term, it remains at historically high levels, which will continue to weigh on prices. Furthermore, while OPEC has indeed agreed to production cuts, which we saw earlier this month, the effect failed to shock the market. A 1.2 million barrel reduction (per day) from OPEC did not appear to be enough to convince investors that supply concerns would dissipate. Importantly, compliance by OPEC to adhere to these cuts has in the past proved a challenge, providing investors with little confidence the full extent of this cut will actually reach the market. Three, the dropping of oil prices has sent bond yields up on Energy companies in the high yield space. While the market turmoil has increased the spread on high yield as a whole, Energy has been disproportionately impacted, as illustrated in the chart below: \\n\\n Source: EIA My takeaway here is that this will pressure short-term profits, as borrowing costs are going to rise for the sector. While earnings could still grow, the dropping price of oil, coupled with rising interest costs, will make it difficult for many energy companies to increase earnings in a meaningful way. Furthermore, borrowing costs for the sector appear to be going up more than the market average, which means the sector will see disproportionate impacts to profits. In summary, this does not appear to be an ideal scenario, and is not the sector I want to be overly exposed to at this time.\\n DTN Falls Short in Comparison As I mentioned in the preceding paragraph, the energy holdings of DTN have been a drag on the fund. While including the Financials sector would not have improved the fund\\'s performance this year, it is still important to consider that some of the sectors within DTN, notably Energy, have larger weightings because of this exclusion. Therefore, investors have to decide if this methodology makes sense, and if it has been a profitable strategy to exercise. Unfortunately, the fund\\'s selection has not been lucrative in 2018, as DTN has lagged the broader S&P 500 and other dividend funds. To illustrate, I will compare DTN to the SPDR S&P 500 ETF (SPY), the WisdomTree Total Dividend ETF (DTD), and, my current favorite, the iShares Core Dividend Growth ETF (DGRO). The year-to-date performance of all of them are listed in the graph below, as well as the performance of the Energy and Financials sectors, as measured by the Financial Select Sector SPDR ETF (XLF) and Energy Select SPDR ETF (XLE): \\n\\n Source: CNBC As you can see, SPY, DGRO, and DTD have all handily beat DTN this year, which does not inspire much confidence. The chart also shows that while DTN out-performed XLF, XLE was actually a larger drag on the fund than XLF would have been. My takeaway here is that excluding Financials in order to increase exposure to Energy has actually been a losing play for this year. As I mentioned above, I believe 2019 will bring about more of the same. Of course, this is simply past performance, and does not guarantee the results of next year. It is very possible that DTN will make up lost ground and begin out-performing these other funds. However, there is a key reason why I am not optimistic on this occurring. This is the fund\\'s dividend growth, which was on the surface quite impressive, but actually lagged the above alternatives a well in 2018. This has been an extremely important focus of mine this year, mainly due to increasing interest rates, and we are likely to see continued rate increases next year. In order for companies and funds to remain attractive compared to bonds, their income streams need to increase at attractive rates. Using DTD and DGRO as examples, let us compare their dividend growth this year against DTN, illustrated in the table below:\\n   Fund YOY Dividend Growth   DTN 12%   DTD 15%   DGRO 15%   Source: Seeking Alpha Dividend History As you can see, DTN falls short in this important comparison. Couple this reality with that fact that the DTN\\'s top sector has been the worst performer this year, and I don\\'t have a lot of confidence that we will see stronger dividend growth from DTN compared to DTD or DGRO in the new year. Financials Set To Rally in 2019 For full disclosure, I have been bullish on the Financials sector all year and, despite some short-term moments of glory, have been paying the price for under-performance. Despite characteristics that are seemingly positive for the sector, such as rising interest rates, a growing economy, increasing dividends, and a below-market valuation, the sector has struggled, and my prediction has not panned out. However, I am undeterred going into 2019, and continue to believe conditions are right for the sector to rally. First, the sector as a whole seems extremely undervalued. Due to strong earnings growth and declining share prices, the Financials sector is currently sporting a price to earnings (P/E) ratio above 10. While low on the surface, it is especially attractive when we consider the S&P 500 has a P/E ratio above 18. My point here is that the sector likely has limited downside from here, relative to the market, because it is markedly cheaper. While by no means a guarantee, I feel the strong underlying performance of the sector, which I will highlight below, coupled with the cheap valuation will ultimately drive strong performance in share prices sooner rather than later. To illustrate this point, I will display key metrics for three of the largest financial institutions in the U.S. These are JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Bank of America (BAC), and Wells Fargo Co. (WFC). The chart below lists the Q3 results for each, including the year-over-year increase from Q3 2017:   Company Revenue (billions) YOY % Net Profit (billions) YOY Increase Net Interest Income (billions) YOY Increase YOY Dividend Increase   JPM 27.8 5% 8.4 24% 14.1 7% 43%   BAC 22.8 4% 7.2 32% 12 5.3% 60%   WFC 21.9 <1% 6.0 33% 12.6 1% 10%   Source: JPMorgan Chase Investor Relations, Bank of America Investor Relations, Wells Fargo Investor Relations As you can see, these figures are resoundingly strong and display consistent year-over-year growth. Yet, these stocks are all down, and quite significantly. This tells me the drop is likely overdone, with a justifiable rebound waiting in the wings. Going long this sector is something I plan to continue doing in 2019, and DTN simply does not offer this opportunity. Bottom Line DTN is a fund I continue to avoid, namely because of its primary focus of excluding Financials. However, there are legitimate reasons for wanting to avoid Financials right now, as the sector has been under-performing the broader market by a wide margin this year. While I personally believe a rebound is forthcoming, I understand why investors may disagree. However, even if you are in that camp, I do not believe DTN is the way to play the market going forward. While the sacrificing of Financials has made sense in 2018, DTN has under-performed because its top sector, Energy, is performing even worse. While the fund has a high, and growing, dividend, other funds best DTN on this count, all while having less exposure to the volatile energy market. Therefore, I believe it is unlikely DTN will be a rewarding choice in 2019, and I would continue to recommend avoiding this fund going forward.\\nDisclosure: I am/we are long DGRO, SCHD, DTD, JPM.

In a similar exercise of self-evaluation, let’s first look at my Q4 Outlook from three months ago. Here were the article bullets:  By all historical measures, the stock market is overvalued. This doesn't mean stocks cannot go even higher like they did in 1999. But we are almost 10 years into this cycle, and the limits of the recent massive fiscal stimulus will become apparent in Q1 2019. Even if revenues remain strong, earnings growth rates will slow, as the one-year effect of the corporate tax cuts disappear and headwinds appear. I expect the year to close out strong, but bad news will be just around the corner.  Well, nothing’s changed, except of course that last one. I was expecting a fall swoon, followed by one last rally, beginning sometime between Election Day and Black Friday, focused on the US consumer and a strong retail season. The strong retail season has come, but market participants have been focused on other macro risks, and no one seems to care. At least I bought a new TV on Black Friday. You’re welcome, America. Just doing my job, ma’am.\\n But really, I could pretty much copy and paste my bullets from three months ago. I don’t think we are at bottom yet, but I believe we will see it in 2019. I write this on Christmas Day. The S&P sits at 2351, outside the +/- 0.6 standard deviation channel of my weekly regression model for the first time since I first started charting it in 2013. The federal government is shut down. We are in a trade war with the second largest economy in the world that has now degenerated to hostage-taking. There is upheaval in the executive branch. People are losing their minds over interest rates when they are still historically low by a long ways. Every data point is poured over for the negative, and the positive is ignored. By the time you read this, lord knows where the S&P will be. If 2018 hasn’t taught us all a little humility, then we are all in trouble. A Quick Rant on Forward Estimates \\n\\nI know everything. Source: Wikimedia Commons You will not catch me using any forward estimates in my outlook. Any time you turn on CNBC, and you hear someone talking about forward estimates as if it means something, you can instantly tune out the rest of what they have to say, and go back to whatever you were doing, which in my case is usually watching Bojack Horseman. Zack’s helpfully compiles analyst estimates for just about every stock in the coverage universe, so we can see exactly how good these forward estimates are. I looked at the week of November 5 to 9, in which Zack’s lists 1149 companies reporting earnings with analyst estimates. The median “surprise” was 20% off the average analyst estimate. The mean “surprise” was 78%. Why is it a surprise that these estimates are so horribly wrong? It happens every quarter.\\n Moreover, these estimates were made by analysts in the weeks leading up to the earnings report, after the quarter was actually over. If estimates are that bad so close to reporting, imagine how bad they are 3, 6 or 12 months out. The Market Is Still Overvalued By historical measures, the S&P is still above historical medians. Back in October when I first wrote about it, we were a little off the January peaks, but extremely high by historical standards. Let’s take a look where we stand with the S&P off about 18% since then. None of the measurements in this section are good indicators of short-term movements in the market, but are rather presented as evidence of the high valuation of the S&P 500. All the S&P data in this section come from Robert Schiller’s S&P 500 data set that goes back to the 19th Century, which is updated daily by the good folks at multpl.com. Also, I will be discussing median values a lot. Remember that medians are not a support level, but typically more of a look-out-below in a bear market. PE is the simplest way to look at valuation. When I wrote in October, the S&P 500 PE was at 22.60. A combination of continued strong earnings (higher denominator) and price decline (lower numerator), have brought that down to 18.03, a 20% decline. First, let’s look at it historically from the beginning of Schiller’s data set. \\n\\n Chart mine. Source data: Robert Schiller’s S&P 500 data set, multpl.com, and FRED series USREC As you can see, with the exception of 2001 and 2008, were at an historically high level, peaking in January at almost 25 and coming down since. A return to the median historical PE of 14.73 would drop the S&P to about 1920. But you are probably noticing something in the chart that I’ve noticed in just about every historical economic chart I’ve ever looked at. While January’s peak is similar to other peaks, such as the Panic of 1893, the 1921 Depression, the Great Depression and the early-1990s recession, the last two cycles are literally off the chart. December, 2001 peaked at over 46, and, get this, 124 in May, 2009. That’s a real number! Moreover, the bottoms have barely breached the historical medians after Black Monday in 1987.\\n When I look at a chart where every cycle looks pretty similar until the last two, I start asking myself if there’s any merit to this-time-it’s-different. So let’s look at the data again, but this time beginning the last time the S&P 500 PE really bottomed out the way it has in the past, which is March, 1982. \\n\\nChart mine. Source data: Robert Schiller’s S&P 500 data set, multpl.com, and FRED series USREC The median PE in this window is 19.02, which means we are already below it, in look-out-below territory. But as you can see in the chart, PE is very volatile, and not always highly correlated to recessions. In fact, PE looks more like a trailing indicator of recession than a leading one. In my opinion, PE10, the inflation-adjusted 10-year rolling average PE developed by Robert Shiller is a much better measure that smooths out much of the noise in the straight PE number, and makes more sense when laid out over US recessions. \\n\\nChart mine. Source data: Robert Schiller’s S&P 500 data set, multpl.com, and FRED series USREC The PE10 peaked in January at over 33 and then again at the end of the September rally. This is high by historical standards, eclipsing all but the dot-com bubble, which again, is literally off the chart. A return to the median historical PE10 of 15.68 would drop the S&P to about 1420. But again in the chart we see that something has changed since the last big bottom in 1982. Zooming the chart in again, beginning at the PE10 low in August, 1982:\\n \\n\\nChart mine. Source data: Robert Schiller’s S&P 500 data set, multpl.com, and FRED series USREC The median PE10 in this window is 23.02, which would be a drop in the S&P to 2080. One of the more obscure market valuations is the Buffet Indicator. In a 2001 interview with Fortune, Warren Buffett said: ...the market value of all publicly traded securities as a percentage of the country's business--that is, as a percentage of GNP. The ratio has certain limitations in telling you what you need to know. Still, it is probably the best single measure of where valuations stand at any given moment. I’m going to modify this a bit and use the Wilshire 5000 total market cap to nominal GDP (using GNP doesn’t change much). FRED has yet to integrate the just-released final Q3 GDP numbers into this set, so the data are only through Q2. Even economists need some time off over Christmas. Or maybe they’re just furloughed. \\n\\nSource: FRED As of June 30, the Buffet Indicator is actually at its highest point in our 1982+ window. A return to the median of 0.84 would drop the S&P to about 1625. Is it just me, or is all this very discomforting? What Happened in the 80s, Dude? Well, everyone dressed awfully and joined a downtown arts scene. Oh, you mean the economy. Ever since I started noticing the changes in these charts that began during or shortly after the 1981 recession, I’ve been asking myself what changed. I am typically not sympathetic to this-time-it’s-different, but it’s always important to keep an open mind about it. Things stay the same until they change. I’ve been edging towards a theory here, and here’s what I have so far.\\n The first step, and likely the most important for getting this ball rolling, was Paul Volcker pushing the Fed Funds rate up to 20% to break inflation. This caused a massive recession and much hardship, but it was entirely necessary. It’s just about the gutsiest thing a Fed Chair has ever done, and makes the current kerfuffle over Jerome Powell almost laughable. For Reagan’s part, he whined a bit, but mostly refrained from commenting on Fed policy, and took his beating in the polls with a smile as unemployment spiked. Eventually, he re-nominated Volcker in 1983. So, kudos to both men for pure political courage, the likes of which we rarely see anymore. Secondly, anyone who has read my writing knows I am not a big fan of debt-funded tax cuts, but in 1981 this was the right policy. The top rate was 70%, which had all sorts of distortionary effects on behavior. Additionally, the short-term stimulative effect of the tax cut was needed to soften the blow of draconian Fed policy. In my Q4 Outlook, I went into some detail why I find the supply-side story unconvincing, and I believe that the data unambiguously back me up. I believe that the best tax rates we’ve had were in the 90s, when we saw the last vestige of rational fiscal policy with deficits at the beginning of the cycle and surpluses at the end. But the first two rounds of Reagan tax cuts, and subsequent adjustments by Bush I (for which he lost an election), and Clinton were very important to this macro-trend. Finally, I can’t stop thinking about this chart: \\n\\nSource: FRED Since the peaks in the 1970s, inflation has remained tamed. At first, the policies of the Volcker Fed broke the back of inflation and brought it back to more reasonable levels in the 3-5% range. But then after the 1990s recession, inflation began dropping into its current range of 1.5-2.5% without any significant Fed policy driving it. Since then, inflation has remained historically low, and the Fed has not had big inflationary cues to raise the Fed Funds rate. As investors became convinced that the new low-inflation regime was not going anywhere, long term rates, as represented by the 10-year Treasury, have been dropping steadily over this long period.\\n People spend a lot of time focusing on the Fed Funds rate, but long-term rates are much more important to the health of the economy, because this is the type of borrowing that actually funds investment. As you can see from the chart, these rates are largely out of the control of Fed policy. What Happened in the 90s, Bruh? Well, everyone dressed awfully and joined a grunge-rock band. Oh, you mean the economy. My contention is that the end of the Soviet bloc and the continued expansion of free trade agreements led to an explosion of trade globally, but especially here in the US. Since the 1990s recession, US trade has quadrupled in real total volume (chained dollars). \\n\\nSource: FRED Why is this important? It used to be an obvious point, but no longer is. Trade reduces prices and tames inflation. Here’s a comparison of the Consumer Price Index for the whole economy and the Import Price Index for just imports.1 \\n\\nSource: FRED While the CPI is up about 170% in this period, the IPI is only up 60%. Imports are cheaper, or else they wouldn’t be imported. Look at the IPI in the 1990s. It barely budged. Without the growth of imports, inflation would have been much higher in this period. This entire era of low inflation, low long-term interest rates, and resulting high stock valuations rests on the continued expansion of trade. I want to type this 100 times, but if you have any takeaways from this article, please let this be it.\\n The Trade Deficit Is A Symptom, Not The Disease Any time I write about trade on Seeking Alpha, the comments are replete with arguments about narrowing the trade deficit, and other country’s tariffs against US exports. Indeed, the period I am talking about also coincides with the expansion of the US trade deficit. But in an attempt to pre-empt this, here we go. These tariffs are all problematic, and we have been very successful in the past in reducing them by working through multilateral organizations that we set up to serve our interests, and spending many years negotiating regional agreements like NAFTA and TPP. The main effect of these treaties is to lower other country’s tariffs, because ours are already very low (because we’re awesome that way). But more to the point, our trade deficit is not largely a result of other country’s tariffs, but rather a combination of our very high budget deficit and very low savings rate. Let’s look at this in a micro way. So, I’ve just promoted you to CEO of a Chinese company, One Belt One Road Technologies. Congrats! Here’s a fruit basket.\\n\\n The Fruit Basket: When You Care Enough To Send The Very Least. Source: Wikimedia Commons You do a lot of business exporting to the US, and so now you have a growing pile of USD. But what can you do with it? You can’t pay Chinese workers or local contractors. You can’t pay your taxes and fees. Did you ever imagine that having a lot of dollars would be such a problem? So you either have to purchase US goods or services (importing), or dollar-denominated assets. Many of these assets come with risks, and a drop in their value could put a hole in your balance sheet, leading to a run on your own stock price. Did I mention that in addition to the fruit basket, the board granted you a ton of shares, and your own personal net worth is highly tied to 1B1R Tech stock price? You should probably avoid that risk.\\n But there is one US asset class, US Treasuries, that fit your needs perfectly. The risk is extremely low. There’s plenty of supply, because the US runs a large and growing deficit and Americans do not save enough to fund the debt themselves. Rates are low, but above inflation, and you can always buy TIPS if that’s a concern. Bingo! But what if there wasn’t such a large supply of Treasuries, either because of a reduction in the deficit, or a higher US savings rate? When demand outstrips supply the price goes up, and suddenly US Treasuries would begin to look less attractive. The only other options at that point would be to either import US goods and services, because other dollar-denominated assets are too risky to your company and to you personally. Or you can open up a US plant and pay for CapEx and payroll with those dollars. That’s what BMW did. Now multiply this decision-making process by every foreign company that does business in the US. If we didn’t have such a large deficit and low savings rate, these dollars would have to come back here in a much more productive way than funding tax cuts for corporations. The Next Recession Recessions are notoriously difficult to call at first, and usually we don’t know until a quarter or two after it’s already started. For example, in the last go around, then CNBC talking head and current White House Chief Economic Advisor, Larry Kudlow had this to say when we were already in recession in December, 2007:  There is no recession. Despite all the doom and gloom from the economic pessimistas, the resilient U.S economy continues moving ahead ‘quarter after quarter, year after year’ defying dire forecasts and delivering positive growth. In fact, we are about to enter the seventh consecutive year of the Bush boom… There’s no recession coming. The pessimistas were wrong. It’s not going to happen. At a bare minimum, we are looking at Goldilocks 2.0. (And that’s a minimum). Goldilocks is alive and well. The Bush boom is alive and well. It’s finishing up its sixth consecutive year with more to come. Yes, it’s still the greatest story never told. \\n So, don’t trust anyone’s predictions about recessions, including mine. My yield-curve based model is currently predicting that the next recession will begin at the earliest in Q4 2019 and has been predicting that for some time now. Just for fun, I like to say it will start in December, which would put it exactly 12 years from the beginning of the last one. Helluva run, right? It’s unusual for the stock market to take such a plunge this far out from the beginning of recession. One possible scenario is 1987 Black Monday, where the S&P collapsed without a recession, then slowly regained its value into the next recession, when it collapsed again. Like a double top, but much more dramatic and spread out. But maybe the yield-curve model is wrong and the S&P is right. Maybe we are closer to the next recession than we think. I’ll get to some of the other macro headwinds in the next section, but there is one very crucial short-term issue in the US economy that I want to cover here: the unprecedented buildup of private inventories in Q3, and what is happening to them right now in Q4. The GDP top line on Q3 came in at 3.4%, which is a nice fat number, until you scroll down the spilts and realize that without changes to private inventories it would be 1.1%. Oof. Companies built up inventories in advance of tariffs, and imports skyrocketed, while exports were a negative on GDP growth. There is often an inventory buildup in Q3 for Christmas, but never this large. What we want to see in Q4 is a big reduction in inventories coupled with high growth in wholesale and retail trade, hospitality services and a better trade picture. In short, the Merriest of Merry Christmases. If inventories remain high or grow, or exports don’t recover, it is an extremely troubling sign, and would likely mean we are on the precipice of a recession, if not already in one. Our limited view of Christmas retail is mostly very positive, so I find this worst case highly unlikely. Our first taste of Q4 GDP data is a month away. So now, we wait.\\n Defending Jerome Powell and the Fed \\n\\nPictured: December FOMC meeting. Source: Wikimedia Commons If you watch CNBC, you’d think Jerome Powell and the Fed were Genghis Khan and his hordes wreaking havoc across the steppe. Nothing could be farther from the truth, and they remain among the few responsible actors in this whole mess. If I hear one more guy in a trading badge say, “the Fed causes every recession,” as if there weren’t frequent depressions before central bank monetary control, my head may explode. Here’s what the S&P looked like in the 20th Century leading up to Fed monetary control: \\n\\nChart mine. Source data: Robert Schiller’s S&P 500 data set Does that look like fun to you? Here’s US recessions dating back to the 19th Century: \\n\\nChart mine. Source data: FRED series USREC Notice anything? Since the Great Depression, active Fed policy has reduced the frequency of recessions, and they are also shallower and shorter. If you think 2009 was bad, look at all that dark gray before 1932. Madonne! Here’s the actual truth. The Fed Funds rate is historically low. Like, 237 bps below the historical mean and 212 bps below the historical median. Jerome Powell can say, “we’re a long way from neutral,” or, “we are just below neutral.” It doesn’t matter. Powell should not be caring how traders on the floor feel about the nuance he puts into every utterance. His responsibility as an independent central banker is to watch the data, and use the tools of the Fed to respond as stewards of the US economy, not the stock market. Greenspan made the mistake of trying to substitute cryptic pronouncements for actual policy, and Powell seems determined not to repeat this.\\n We are at the end of a long cycle, and this is all totally backwards — typically by this point the Fed Funds is higher, not lower than historical averages. At the same time, and also backwards, the GOP dramatically increased the late-cycle deficit with debt-funded tax cuts, and the Fed is still a long way from unwinding its balance sheet. All at the end of a 10-year cycle. Say it with me: at the end of the cycle. Contrary to popular belief, the Fed does not control Treasury rates directly; these rates are determined by auctions and daily trading. The market is more powerful than either central bank policy or government fiscal policy, as the 1990s clearly show. Long term rates, which are the important rates, remain largely beyond Fed control. But more to the point, interest rate hikes, when done slowly and deliberately, do not tank investment, or at least good investment. In fact, extended periods of low interest rates lead to the interest rate trap, where good money goes to marginal investments that inevitably fail in the next recession, creating debt bubbles and deeper losses. Or think of it this way: any investment that can’t survive a yearlong rise in the Fed Funds rate from 150 to 250 was probably a really bad idea in the first place. Finally, on the reaction to the last Fed minutes last week, I’m just flabbergasted by the negativity that accompanied it. If people decided that this press conference portrayed a firm commitment to two hikes in 2019, it was only what they wanted to see in the first place. When a statement begins with three paragraphs on how the Fed’s outlook for the economy is still good but has soured a little because of data off their peaks, my immediate conclusion is that the people writing that statement are keeping a close eye on the data and will react accordingly. For everyone else, apparently, there needed to be a billboard across the street from the NYSE that read:  Dear Wall Street, Flexible. Love, The Fed  When John Williams tried to explain the obvious to everyone the next day on CNBC, the rally was short-lived, because sentiment is negative, no matter what the Fed says or does.\\n Stop focusing on the Fed. They are doing an impossible job well in an era of rampant irresponsibility. The Trump Risk Factor Fo two years now, I have tried to not mention the President of the United States, which is strange thing to have to do when you are writing about the US economy and stock market, and especially when Trump has so closely tied his legitimacy to the Dow through daily tweets. But any mention of his name immediately puts the reader into one camp or another, and everything else in the article becomes judged through that lens. Emotion overrules reason, and I always try and avoid that. But the chronic disease that is Trump’s narcissism, belligerence, and self-imposed ignorance has now become acute, and it is no longer possible to write an article like this without dealing with the President of the United States as a huge macro risk. Trade This is of course much-discussed, but the mistake I hear over and over again is that tariffs are a means to an end for Trump, though those ends may be a moving target. This is a huge misunderstanding. Trump loves tariffs. They are not the means; they are the end. He has been talking about them since the 1980s, except then it was about Japan, not China. Notice there is zero discussion of getting rid of steel and aluminum tariffs. What he sees is only the few new steel jobs in western Pennsylvania, and the marginally increased tariff revenue to the Treasury. He ignores all the negative effects, which are legion and much bigger than a few thousand jobs. People may be beginning to catch on. Here’s the S&P since Trump declared himself “Tariff Man” on Twitter on December 4th.  \\n\\n^SPX data byYCharts  Of all the things that frighten me about Trump, it is his self-imposed ignorance regarding how trade works that is most terrifying. Moreover, Trump’s general neo-mercantilist view of trade as zero-sum is already backfiring spectacularly.\\n In Q3 GDP, net exports pulled a full 2% out of GDP growth. -0.6% was from exports alone, which were +0.4% in Q3 2017, a full percentage point of GDP growth less. In Q2 2018, exports added 1.1% to GDP growth. It is a complete collapse in exports, while imports are skyrocketing. This is what happens when the most powerful country in the world tries to cut everyone else off at the knees. We are no taller, and everyone loses. As I emphasized above, I believe that the foundation of the outsized valuations of the S&P since 1982 is the low long-term interest rate regime that is largely the result of the deflationary effects of free trade. Without an active trade sector, which means a lot of imports as well as exports, this can all end, and much quicker than you think. China I’m going to begin by stipulating that Trump is correct in some of his assessment of China. They often do not play by many of the same rules as everyone else, and the issue of IP theft and forced transfers is the most troubling, not the trade deficit as he repeated over and over during the campaign. But Trump’s strategy is very likely not to achieve any of its ends. At this point, trying to predict what is going to happen next with China is a painful exercise in humility. But I’m going to give it a go anyway. I continue to agree with Jack Ma that this trade war will be measured in years, not months. The parties are too far apart for a few metric tonnes of soybeans and a reversal of Chinese retaliation on US autos to make a difference. On the US side, Trump has absorbed the teachings of outcast-amongst-economists, Peter Navarro, and they are determined to bring China to its knees. I am not sure what will steer them from this course. Trump’s biggest problem here is that he has never read Sun Tzu: If you know yourself but not the enemy, for every victory gained you will also suffer a defeat. Trump engages in mirroring, which is that he assumes everyone else is motivated by the same things that motivate him. This served him fine when dealing with NY real estate types and post-Soviet investors, but it serves him very poorly with the Chinese.\\n On the Chinese side, I’m going to guess that by contrast, Xi has read Sun Tzu and spends a lot of time trying to understand US motivations. Xi does not have midterms or a re-election to worry about, and the Party has already shown in Tiananmen that when push literally comes to shove, the People’s Army will run their tanks right over the people. The pressure on him from below is minimal and not an existential threat to the Party. The Chinese view themselves as the center of the world, the Middle Kingdom, do not respond well to this sort of bullying, and are too big to bring to their knees. Moreover, this is a country that, just within living memory, has survived:  The Rape of Nanking and other atrocities of Japanese occupation Civil War and the Communist Revolution The Great Leap Forward The Cultural Revolution The Death of Mao and the succession chaos that followed The ascension of Deng, the move towards a quasi-capitalist economy, and all the social dislocation that accompanied that. Tiananmen Square  I don't think they are scared of tariffs. So where does that leave us? Certainly the taking of hostages by each side is extremely unhelpful. The current 90-day truce seems unlikely to produce a real breakthrough, and the tension is spilling over into other strategic areas. Trump is playing a dangerous game, the rules of which I don’t think he understands. I am not optimistic, can you tell? Alliances Trump’s disdain for the wishes and needs of allies is a strong undercurrent of his foreign policy, but the resignation letter of Jim Mattis has put new focus on it. Unsurprisingly eschewing the usual niceties of these letters, the Warrior Monk got right to the point:  One core belief I have always held is that our strength as a nation is inextricably linked to the strength of our unique and comprehensive system of alliances and partnerships. While the US remains the indispensable nation in the free world, we cannot protect our interests or serve that role effectively without maintaining strong alliances and showing respect to those allies… My views on treating allies with respect and also being clear-eyed about both malign actors and strategic competitors are strongly held and informed by over four decades of immersion in these issues. We must do everything possible to advance an international order that is most conducive to our security, prosperity and values, and we are strengthened in this effort by the solidarity of our alliances. \\n I’m with General Mattis on this one. The postwar Pax Americana is the longest period of global growth, prosperity and relative peace in all of human history. It is built on America’s commitment to free trade, whether or not others reciprocate, international institutions which we built to serve our ends, and a commitment to multilateralism and leadership. This “altruism,” or stupidity as Trump would have it, is responsible for this: we are 4.4% of the world’s population and 24.3% of global GDP. Does that sound like losing? Trump’s main foreign policy project is to dismantle this postwar system that has kept us safe and prosperous for over 70 years, because he thinks it makes us stupid suckers. Does that scare you? It scares me. The last great moment in US foreign policy was Bush I and the first Gulf War. Bush and his Secretary of State, James Baker, spent over a year painstakingly building and maintaining a coalition that eventually included almost the entire world. Had Trump done the same thing and faced China with the entire world at his back, he might have some chance for success. As it is, we are spiraling downward with no end in sight. Immigration This is a quick one. Economic growth is highly correlated to population growth. We don’t have a lot of native population growth, so we need more immigrants not less. If any of you want to ever see 100% of your Social Security, you should want more immigrants, too. The Shutdown and Mnuchin’s Mess In the middle of all this chaos, Trump has decided to throw a temper tantrum and shut down the federal government over $5 billion in funding for a useless border wall, or barrier, or steel slats, or whatever he is calling it today. There is no end in sight. Then he sent Mnuchin out to meet with the banks and release a statement on the Sunday before Christmas saying, everything’s cool, no liquidity problems here. I don’t know about you, but that stank of panic in the executive branch to me, and I think the market agreed:  \\n\\n^SPX data by\\nYCharts  Thank god it was a half-day. All this is Trump’s short-sighted outlook coming home to roost. But What About Tax Cuts? I went through this at length in my Q4 Outlook, but I find the supply-side story very unconvincing and the data backs me up here. There is a very small boost to capital formation from increased corporate profits, but that boost does not translate into increased worker productivity as predicted by the supply-siders. Without this crucial element, there is no increased long-term growth, and all we get is a growing deficit. Sound familiar? It should, because that’s how the Bush tax cuts worked out. Anyway, the CapEx will not save us. Positioning As I said in my Q4 Outlook, I began detecting a lot of negative sentiment during Q2 earnings season. I would see a quarterly report premarket that I thought was great, and then the stock would get drubbed during the trading day. This happened repeatedly. People seemed to focus on whatever negative they could find in every data set. I concluded that everything was already priced for perfection, and sentiment was turning bearish. At the same time, trade war issues were growing increasingly worrisome, so I cleared my portfolio of almost everything with any China exposure, which took me up to 70% cash by the third week of October, where I sat for a long time. Trust me, 70% cash is boring. This is when I started watching Bojack Horseman during the trading day instead of CNBC. I’m so much happier. It is now what I consider my bear market portfolio — only those companies I love the most and won’t sell, and a few dividend stocks. The moment I saw the Tariff Man Tweet, I started buying into the ProShares Ultrapro Short S&P 500 ETF (SPXU), which is a triple-leveraged S&P inverse ETF, and bought more as the month progressed. At the moment, I am actually negatively positioned because of this and it has made up for all the losses in my longs this month. This is my preferred strategy for riding these periods out. Outlook So this is more or less the portfolio I will enter the new year with. I see the early part of the year working out in one of two ways. Either we are in a 1987 scenario where the crash will not be followed by a recession, and the S&P will slowly recover into the next recession some time in the near future.\\n Or, this is it: the end. The variety of headwinds I’ve described above will bring the recession sooner than I or others expect. There is an old joke that near the end of the cycle, the next recession is always two years away. I’m always open to the possibility that this was correct two years ago. The thing that bothers me the most is something I mentioned up top in the introduction. Since 2013, I have been charting the cycle-long linear regression trendline of the weekly S&P chart with +/- 0.6 standard deviation channels. In all that time, the S&P has never closed outside those channels and has bounced off the upper and lower bounds on several occasions, most recently the January high. On Monday, it closed outside the model for the first time, plunging below the current lower bound of 2392 by 1.73%. We are now literally off the chart. I believe we are now off the bull market trend that began all the way back in March of 2009 and on to a new trend. Where it goes, we will have to see. So as always, we watch and wait, and let the market tell us what it wants to do. The first economic data point I will be looking for in 2019 will be the disposition of those inventories I discussed above, and we will get our first clues in a month.

Given the recent market turmoil and looming economic slowdown coupled with rising interest rates, Nobina's business seems to be a good fit for anyone seeking shelter from these risks. Since the main goal of this article is to present an investment opportunity to investors who prefer high and non-cyclical dividend income-paying stocks, I will analyze the Nobina's capacity to pay dividends, and I will take a look at how safe they are in terms of keeping (or even increasing) the current levels in the future. Company overview and Nordic public transport outlook Nobina, a Sweden-based company with a market cap of USD 591 million, is the Nordic region's largest and most experienced public transport service provider. The company's operations consist of the provision of scheduled bus services under contract to public transport authorities in Sweden, Norway, Denmark, and Finland. It also offers express bus services throughout Sweden. The market is characterized by long contracts that are won by tender. Previously, some of the market's players have not always submitted tenders that have been financially justifiable, which has pressed down the profitability of the sector. For a number of years, Nobina has developed and refined its bidding process, which has resulted in a good earnings trend. The long contracts (eight years on average) mean that it is extremely important that the tenders are right; otherwise, the company can be left with an unprofitable contract for several years.\\n The Nordic countries have similar conditions in terms of public services - a high degree of environmental awareness and public initiatives to increase public transport. According to the Urban Transport Group research, the key characteristics of Scandinavian public transport are:  High-frequency services with high-quality vehicles with a good off-peak provision. Smart and simple multi-modal ticketing (with multi-modal fares delivering excellent value for money in comparison to incomes). High levels of public transport use. Ambitious plans for public transport's role in reducing carbon and toxic emissions through low- or zero-emission bus fleets and modal shift from other modes. Public transport strategies that align with wider national and sub-national goals for economic development, land use planning, and social cohesion. Significant innovation including vehicle technologies, smart ticketing and customer service. Levels of revenue support for bus services which underpin a high quality of service (with higher funding per head and per trip on a bus than in UK city regions, although in Swedish cities funding per bus trip is lower).  Scandinavian countries have taken this approach because there is a political and public consensus that public transport is a public service. A public service that spreads the benefits of economic growth and promotes social cohesion through ensuring better connectivity within and between communities - including linking peripheral areas with the main towns and cities that are driving the wider economy. Sales in the market for public bus transport services are estimated at SEK 45 billion (USD 4.97 billion) and CAGR of 3%, with regional traffic accounting for almost 90 percent of this figure. In all of the Nordic markets, an average of half of the cost of the regional public transport authority is financed through the budgets of regional public administrations. The other half is directly from passengers through ticket revenues. Nobina operates in the market where there is free competition and pricing is without public subsidies. Nobina's estimated market share in the Nordic region is approximately 16%.\\n Q3, acquisitions and new financial targets Nobina had a strong Q3, in which it increased its revenue by 15.4% compared to Q3-2017; excluding the recent acquisitions, the growth was 13%. The strong underlying growth came from existing contracts where both production-based compensation and incentive compensation increased significantly. Cash flow from operations and EPS showed the same trend compared to the same quarter last year - 12.8% and 15.8% respectively. Sweden, the biggest market for Nobina in terms of the revenues generated (72% of total sales), improved considerably resulting in a 25% higher EBIT margin. Nobina concluded the acquisition of a leading player in special public transport services in the Stockholm market, SamTrans AB. At 30 November, it made an agreement to also acquire the public transport company A/S De Blaa Omnibusser in Denmark on a cash and debt-free basis. The company reported an EBT margin of about 16%. Given that SamTrans and De Blaa Omnibusser have EBT margins of 14% and 16% respectively and that as of 30 November, 2018, Nobina's EBT was 5.1%, one could expect margin improvement in the future. In the recent capital market day, Nobina introduced new financial targets: \\n\\n Source: Capital Market Day 2018 Considerable indebtedness outweighed by a positive equity % development and the nature of the revenues While Nobina holds a huge amount of debt relative to the equity on its balance sheet, there is a stable trend in debt/equity ratio improvement. In 2018, (TTM) 19% of its assets were financed with equity. Since 2016, there has been also a significant interest coverage (note: showing how many times over a company could pay its current interest payment with its available earnings) improvement as well.\\n \\n\\n Source: Author based on Morningstar The financial risk is mitigated based primarily on a well-developed business model. Customers are stable and normally sign contracts that on average extend over eight years. The increasing costs are matched with the contracts, which are indexed to cover rising interest expenses and fuel prices. In addition, the non-cyclical business model (public transport is hardly affected by cyclical fluctuations) lowers the financial risk further. Stable margins and ~5% dividend Despite some acquisitions and competitive industry, throughout 2014-2018, Nobina has proven that it can hold its margins constant and, in the case of gross profit and EBITDA, manage to even improve them. Taking into consideration the recent two acquisitions that operate with 2.5X higher EBT margins, one could reasonably expect further margin enhancement for Nobina. \\n\\n Source: Author based on Morningstar Currently, Nobina trades at a 5.06% dividend. Any dividend investor could feel safe in that the company will continue to provide a dividend at least at the same level that it currently does. In the capital market day 2018, it has stated that the firm will aim to pay out a minimum 75% of EBT. If one assumes that Nobina will achieve the minimum growth target of 5%, then the dividend yield in 2019 and 2020 should be around 5.5% and 5.8%. However, the consensus dividend yield forecast for 2019 and 2020 lands at 6.1% and 6.9%, because the majority of the analysts who follow Nobina predict that the profits will grow at much faster pace than the stated minimum growth target. The justification for that is mainly the promising sales and margin improvement from the recent acquisitions.\\n Risks/Mitigation Debt burden. The company has indeed a relatively huge debt amount that in the case of rising interest rates and a slowing economy could become much harder to cover. However, Nobina's contracts include a hedge against an increase in interest rates, which to some extent should outweigh that negative effect. Moreover, the company ties all bus lease contracts to the maturity of the revenue-generating contracts, thereby reducing the financial risk. Low-profit margin. For example, if the company suddenly losses a significant number of contracts and its fixed costs don't decrease accordingly, a profit margin of 5% provides a minimal margin of safety. This risk is somewhat mitigated by the nature of Nobina's contracts, which have long periods and are tied to maturity of its debts. In addition, the public transport industry is non-cyclical and the Nordic region in which Nobina operates has strong political support for further development of public transportation. 75% payout ratio. Since the company pays out a majority of its earnings, there is a reasonable ground to expect no huge long-term earnings growth. However, for an investor who seeks to get a stable and above-average dividend yield, this circumstance shouldn't lessen the stock's attractiveness. Conclusion Nobina is an attractive choice for one who seeks to obtain an above-average and safe dividend yield. In the long term, one shouldn't anticipate major growth in the dividends due to its already high payout ratio and the high debt amounts in the balance sheet. In my opinion, its current dividend yield of 5% (2019E and 2020E 6.1% and 6.9% respectively) should be attractive enough to sacrifice the gains of its further expansion especially considering Nobina's resistance to fluctuations in the economy and its revenue-generating contracts, which are indexed to rising interest rates and fuel prices (considerable cost component). I view this as right timing and right stock to include in a portfolio, which seeks to deliver high and non-cyclical income streams.\\n P.S. Before taking a position in Nobina's stock, one should consider the embedded currency risk since the majority of its revenues are generated in Swedish krona.\\nDisclosure: I/we have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

Click here to find out more » Is the Recession Here? Yes, it is here waiting in the wings. One can expect NBER to declare a recession end of 2019. My estimate is it will start around September 2019 and end between May and October 2020. Expect a 2020 election year that is focused on the economy. Yes, that means the S&P will decline over the next two years, and like the Wall Street Crash of 2008 that was triggered by the 2007 Great Recession, one can expect similar events in 2019 and 2020 unless preventive action is taken. How Strong is the YCI-Recession Relationship? Recessions are defined by National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER), the organization tasked with identifying when a recession starts and ends. I define these recessions as the NBER-Recessions, as they are after the fact, i.e. lagging indicators of the economy and of little use to investors. With the news of Treasury yield curve inversions, this video, Dept. of Treasury Daily Yield Curve, of daily treasury rates from 3 months to 30 years should be of interest. This video shows when the yield curve inverts:  The 7-month yield curve inversion (YCI) from 06/01/2000 to 01/01/2001 was followed 2 months later by the 11-month 2001 recession of 03/2001 to 11/2001. Similarly, in 2007, the 10-month YCI of 08/16/2007 to 05/17/2008 was followed 3 months later by the 18-month Great Recession of 12/2007 to 06/2009. \\n These two sets of observations strongly suggest that the market wisdom is correct, that a YCI portends a recession and is useful for estimating when (9 to 13 months from first YCI observation with 1990 being the exception) and how long a recession will last (about 1.6x the YCI duration). According to the Bloomberg article, a YCI was observed, but my investigation using FRED data shows that the YCI was not observable in that data as of 12/22/2018. The logical inference is that the observed YCI was a midday phenomenon, not observable in closing prices or a false positive. The Fed\\'s analysis of this phenomenon can be summed as a \"rule of thumb... with two notable false positives: an inversion in late 1966 and a very flat curve in late 1998\". See Yield Curve and Predicted GDP Growth, December 2018. I will come back to this later in this article. The question is how strong is this YCI-Recession relationship? Very. FRED, A Free Data Source There are tens of thousands of economic time series data (FRED) made available for free to the public by the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis. This FRED data is available here. The final set of FRED time series data I used to investigate the YCI-Recession relationship consists of:  CPIAUCNS - Consumer Price Index, monthly, not seasonally adjusted. DTB3 - 3-Month Treasury Bond rates, daily rates, not seasonally adjusted DGS5 - 5-Year Treasury Bond rates, daily rates, not seasonally adjusted DGS10 - 10-Year Treasury Bond rates, daily rates, not seasonally adjusted DGS20 - 20-Year Treasury Bond rates, daily rates, not seasonally adjusted DGS30 - 30-Year Treasury Bond rates, daily rates, not seasonally adjusted A191RL1Q225SBEA - Real Gross Domestic Product, Percent Change from Preceding Period, Quarterly, Seasonally Adjusted Annual Rate M1NS - M1 Money Stock, Billions of Dollars, monthly, not seasonally adjusted  How The Fed Missed the Boat - They Actually Did! Let\\'s step back a minute. The Fed\\'s approach to this type of analysis can be summed up as the use of a statistical relationship between its slope and future economic growth, and then look where the current yield curve is pointing. It is, though by no means a fault of the Fed, an approach that introduces statistical model errors and noise.\\n \\n\\n Fig 1: Comparison of year-over-year (Y2Y) versus quarter-over-quarter (Q2Q), (Source: Ben Solomon 2018) Further, it is also sensitive to whether one uses 12-month year-over-year (Y2Y) GDP growth or quarterly (Q2Q) GDP growth as is usually reported and used by NBER to determine NBER-Recessions. See Fig. 1. According to Y2Y GDP growth, 2001 was not a recession, and Y2Y GDP growth, 1970 just barely made it to GDP contraction. In their discussion, the Fed used Y2Y GDP growth which does not always line up with NBER\\'s Q2Q GDP growth statistics. To be consistent with NBER-Recession, I used the Q2Q GDP growth statistic. Taking a Different Approach from the Fed Taking a different approach, instead of searching for a YCI-Recession relationship, I searched for the YCI-Signal. This signal is defined as true when the 3-month treasury rate is greater than any longer-term treasury bond rates and false when not. This approach eliminates noise and errors introduced by statistical modeling. \\n\\n Fig 2: YCI-Signals for 5, 10, 20, and 30 years treasury bond rates (Source: Ben Solomon 2018) Fig. 2 shows the occurrences and duration of the YCI-Signal, overlaid with Q2Q GDP growth. For visual ease, the YCI-Signal levels are arbitrarily set to 1.05, 1.10, 1.20, and 1.30 for the 5-, 10-, 20-, and 30-year treasury bond rates, respectively. The YCI-Signal is not always contiguous. Unlike the Fed\\'s approach, this YCI-Signals approach shows that YCI-Signals were present just before all NBER-Recessions. The 1966 YCI-Signal is present but not contiguous. It was not a long duration signal like that of the later ones. That the 1989 YCI-Signal lasted for only about a month, and the double-dip recessions of 1980 and 1982 were preceded by their respective two YCI-Signals. More importantly, the YCI-Signals are present for all treasury bonds 5 years and longer, where this information is available.\\n That is, the YCI-Signal guarantees a NBER-Recession, and the Fed\\'s claim of false positives in 1966 and 1998 are data handling issues and not signal errors. One infers that the YCI is a significant component or property of the economy. YCI-Recession: An Early Warning Metric Personally, I don\\'t like the NBER-Recession statistic because as an economic indicator, it is too late as it is a lagging metric. That is like saying we know it is a recession because we lost money. For example, See Fig. 2, the Great Recession was the trigger that set off the Wall Street Crash of 2008 not the other way around, i.e. Wall Street was ripe for a crash and just needed a trigger. I propose a YCI-Recession that starts with the onset of YCI and ends with the first quarter of positive GDP growth. Based on 7 of the 11 recessions since 1943 (there is no relevant bond data for the first 4 recessions). The analytical definition of a YCI-Recession requires (I) Recession starts with YCI accompanied with declining GDP growth, i.e. each quarter has decreasing GDP growth rates (II) Includes GDP contraction that is negative (III) Recession ends with positive GDP growth. There are two other accompanying factors. See Fig 3. (A) The decreasing year-over-year (Y2Y) M1 and (B) Increasing inflation. These are not exact but are present. Both these factors are now present as of 12/2018. My research shows that the 3-month Treasury rates have a complicated but a positive correlated monotonic relationship with CPI that is not found in the 30-year Treasury rates. Therefore, with the increase in inflation, it is difficult to see how this 3-month Treasury rate will not increase, thereby effecting a YCI. \\n\\n Fig 3: Year-Over-Year M1 & CPI change overlaid (Source: Ben Solomon 2018)\\n This definition of YCI-Recession matches NBER\\'s definition. However, YCI recessions begin earlier, between 1Q to 3Q earlier, and end 1Q earlier. Unlike the NBER-Recession, the YCI-Recession is a leading metric and an early warning metric of where the economy is heading. Recession in 2019/2020? Economic processes are slow, long duration processes. My previous research suggests that 3-month treasury bond rates are correlated to what happened in the economy 20 years ago. Therefore, the midday yield curve inversion reported by Bloomberg news is likely to convert into a FRED data observable YCI. That means the yield curve inversion is coming. Unfortunately, this means that there is a very strong possibility we will have a recession from around September 2019 to about May 2020 i.e. 2020 election year will be about the economy. What does this mean to investors? Get ready to short, buy recession-proof, counter-cyclical stocks, and most importantly, if you have patient money, have cash.\\nDisclosure: I/we have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

Since Nov. 26, the last time we wrote on Nvidia, the stock has fallen about 14%. The bad news is that it may still fall further based on technical and options market analysis. Additionally, the company may be facing more downward pressure on GPU prices which could impact the fourth quarter. RBC noted today it sees weak GPU pricing and cut its price target to $200 from $230. Even with the reduction in the price target, it's still too high. Falling GPU Prices Some GPU prices have been in steady decline since they peaked in early 2018. For example, Nvidia's GeForce GTX 1070 Founder's Edition peaked at nearly $1,000 and had since declined to about $500. The GeForce GTX RTX 2080 Ti Founder's Editions has fallen from a peak of approximately $1,850 to roughly $1,400 just since October. \\n\\n(camelcamelcamel.com) Estimate Cuts? Although there have been further declines in GPU pricing across the spectrum of Nvidia's products, analysts have yet to cut their revenue estimates for the coming fiscal fourth quarter 2019. Consensus estimates project revenue of $2.7 billion for the quarter, a decline of 7% vs. last year. But those estimates have remained unchanged since the company lowered its revenue guidance in November. \\n\\nNVDA Revenue Estimates for Current Quarter data by YCharts\\n Expensive Even with Nvidia's steep decline, the stock is expensive when comparing its one-year forward PE ratio to the sector. The average PE for the top 25 holdings in the iShares PHLX Sox Semiconductor ETF (SOXX) is just 12.35. Nvidia is currently trading at nearly 18. \\n\\nNVDA PE Ratio (Forward 1y) data by YCharts Targets Need To Fall More Price targets for the stock also are too high, and the latest reduction by RBC is just an example of more price target reductions to come. The average price target on Nvidia has fallen from around $290 to around $225. But even that average leaves the stock trading at roughly 31 times 2020 consensus earnings estimates of $7.30, which is well above the sector average as noted previously. \\n\\nNVDA Price Target data by YCharts Technical Weakness The technical charts suggest the stock may fall further as well. Should the stock drop below technical support at $121, it may result in the stock falling to its next level of support at $102. Another negative is that the relative strength index continues to trend lower and that would suggest bullish momentum is continuing to leave the stock. \\n\\n\\n Bearish Options Bets The options market also is implying that stock falls further by expiration on June 21. The puts heavily outweighs the calls by a ratio of about 10 to 1 with roughly 3,000 open put contracts to just 300 open call contracts at the $130 strike price. For a buyer of the puts to earn a profit the stock would need to drop to roughly $110.50, a decline of approximately 13.5%. It's a large wager as well - the puts cost $19.50 to buy and the dollar value of the open interest is about $5.85 million. Not only that but the options are implying the stock rises or falls roughly 29% from $130 strike price by June. That's a massive amount of volatility and places the stock in a trading range of $92 to $168. Risks There are some risks to the thesis because the shares have fallen so much in a short period, which could lead in a dead cat bounce. Should the stock not fall below technical support at $121 they could rally back to around $140. Additionally, should GPU prices begin to rise as inventory levels drop, it could result in the company providing better than expected fiscal first quarter guidance, which may give the stock a big rebound. Conclusion Nvidia's stock is likely to struggle between now and its next set of quarterly results. At this point, it would seem that Nvidia is facing potentially more price target reduction and increasing risk around GPU price trends.

The fact of the matter is that with markets acting in a volatile fashion due to the current administration’s trade wars, plus with the energy space serving as a wild ride, there are few attractive places investors can place their capital. One exception to this, though, is undoubtedly Kinder Morgan (KMI), one of the largest pipeline/midstream service providers in the US. With a strong and stable outlook in terms of cash flow generation, as well as shares that are trading at a low multiple, investors would be unwise not to consider a stake in the firm during these otherwise uncertain times. Management has high expectations This year is shaping up to be a good year for Kinder Morgan. According to management, DCF (distributable cash flow) for the company should come in at around $4.57 billion. On a per-share basis, that comes out to around $2.05, implying a price/DCF for the company of 7.82. This level of cash flow has allowed the firm to fund its significant capex requirements for the year, plus it has given management the opportunity to pay out a distribution of $0.80 per share. Now, if current forecasts are correct, the picture for 2019 could be even better. According to management, because the company’s Elba Liquefaction Project is coming online, and because its Gulf Coast Express is entering into service, 2019 should see DCF come in at about $5 billion. That represents an increase of 9.4% over 2018 and should translate to $2.20 per share, about 7.3% higher on that basis compared to this year. Thanks to this growth in DCF, management said that the company is still on track to pay out $1 per share this year, plus it will be able to pay out $1.25 per share in 2020.\\n \\n\\n*Taken from Kinder Morgan In the image above, you can see a list of current backlog provided by management that it says will allow this kind of distribution payout without requiring the firm to access equity markets. In all, there’s $6.5 billion currently planned. This excludes capex spent on maintaining the current state of operations. Of this, an impressive $4.6 billion, or 71%, will be attributed to natural gas, with the remainder split between other projects that Kinder Morgan has its hands in. For 2019, the expectation is that the firm will allocate $3.1 billion toward capex to further growth, but what 2020 will look like in terms of DCF is still up in the air. One great thing about Kinder Morgan is that, no matter how you stack it, shares of the business are remarkably inexpensive at the moment. Using forward DCF and applying the $35.40 billion market cap the company is valued at today, the firm’s trading multiple is just 7.08. In terms of EBITDA, the picture is even more appealing. According to management, and illustrated in the image below, the business should generate EBITDA next year of around $7.8 billion. If this holds true, it would translate to a price/EBITDA multiple of 4.54, while with net debt of $33.502 billion pushes its EV (enterprise value) up to $68.902 billion. That would translate to an EV / EBITDA multiple of 8.83, which is not bad considering the high-quality nature and stability of the firm. \\n\\n*Taken from Kinder Morgan\\n Cash flow will remain stable I mentioned already that Kinder Morgan is a firm that offers stability, but what, in this context, does stability mean? Simply put, the firm is one that, due to its operational nature and its fee structure (the majority of its contracts are fee based, meaning they don’t have terms that change based on market conditions), should be mostly immune from energy price fluctuations. To see to what degree this is the case, I created the following table below. \\n\\n*Created by Author The table you see illustrates what DCF Kinder Morgan should generate next year for any given average price for oil and natural gas, with oil measured in price/barrel, while natural gas is measured by price/Mcf. The $5 billion target provided by management assumes an average price of $60 per barrel and $3.15 per Mcf, with every $1 per barrel change in the price of oil impacting DCF by $9 million and every $0.10 per Mcf change in the price of natural gas impacting it by $1 million. The range of possibilities here is not all that large. Yes, DCF could come in lower next year than it could this year, but it would require for oil prices to be below $25 per barrel and for natural gas prices to be below $1.75 per Mcf. If something even that bearish happens, it will be a sign that investors have more to worry about than Kinder Morgan’s performance. Under the most optimistic scenario shown by the table, which is $95 per barrel of oil and $4.55 per Mcf for natural gas, DCF would come in at $5.329 billion. In short, the high and low range illustrated by my analysis would translate to a price/DCF on the business of between 6.64 and 7.58. All of these are quire attractive, with anywhere in between warranting upside potential.\\n Determining what kind of potential upside is likely for Kinder Morgan is tough. I would argue, based on its fundamentals, that shares are probably undervalued by perhaps as much as 50%, but even if you want to take a more conservative approach, the picture still looks nice. Right now, the yield for the company for 2019 is 6.23%. For 2018, the yield is about 5%. Applying that difference to share price, with the distribution rising from $0.80 per unit to $1, a price of around $20 can be inferred. That represents upside of 24.7%. Using 2020’s projected payout, that target rises to $25, or about 55.9% (for upside of 24.8% per annum). Given the market’s cautious and yield-driven look at pipeline operators today, these are probably reasonable targets for investor to consider. Takeaway Based on the data provided, it’s clear to me that Kinder Morgan is an interesting company with attractive prospects and a great deal of stability to preserve shareholder value. Absent something wholly unexpected like a prolonged economic downturn of significant size, or fraud, it’s difficult to see long-term downside for investors looking to buy into the business. If anything, it looks like the upside could be quite appealing during the next few years.

Today, we’ll examine data which negates this proposition and instead argues for a market rebound in the months ahead. This optimistic outlook is predicated on the bulls finally capitulating - which they appear very close to doing - and the Fed recognizing its recent policy blunder. We’ll also look at signs which show that a potentially strong short-covering rally is imminent. For many investors, 2018 is a year they’d rather forget. By the last week of December, several major averages - including the benchmark S&P 500 Index (SPX) - had entered classical bear market territory. This of course is defined as a drop of 20% or greater. While analysts continue to dispute the ultimate cause of the market’s October-December decline, the main factor behind it is clear to see. For the last four months, informed investors have been concerned over the potential negative impact of rising interest rates on the U.S. economy and stock market. This was first made manifest starting in September, when a large number of rate-sensitive stocks and funds began making new 52-week lows on the NYSE. This trend of above-normal new 52-week lows on both major exchanges has continued since then and was the biggest warning sign that the market was plagued by a weak undercurrent. Although there have been many “reasons” blamed on the stock market’s poor performance since then, the appearance of many rate-sensitive securities on the new 52-week lows list has been a constant. Even after longer-term U.S. government bond yields pulled back sharply in the last several weeks, the liquidation of income funds continued apace. Shown here is the CBOE 10-Year Treasury Note Yield Index (TNX), which many participants use as a proxy for long-term bond rates. As you can see, bond yields have come down significantly since November and can no longer be seen as an immediate threat to the stock market.\\n \\n\\n Source: BigCharts  If not bond yields, then what is the big worry among stock investors? It’s obvious that the most recent plunge in stock prices was precipitated by the market’s concern over Fed interest rate policy. While it’s true enough that the Fed has been fairly transparent in its intentions to gradually raise the fed funds rate, the recent drop in Treasury yields has made raising the Fed’s benchmark rate a dangerous proposition for stocks and the economy. Veteran investors are well aware that nothing is so fatal to a bull market than a restrictive central bank monetary policy. This happens when the fed funds interest rate gets too close - or exceeds - longer-term Treasury bond yields. When you consider that the effective fed funds rate is 2.40 and the 10-Year Treasury bond yield is 2.74, you can see how fast the spread between the two rates has narrowed in just the last two months. The real danger to the economy, however, doesn’t usually begin until the fed funds rate exceeds the 10-Year Treasury yield. That obviously hasn’t happened yet. \\n\\nSource: BigCharts Another way of illustrating this monetary policy threat is shown below. This graph displays the long-term trend in the 10-Year Treasury constant maturity minus the fed funds rate. Historically, whenever this graph falls below zero and into negative territory, an economic recession follows. This of course is something which no stock investor wants to see. At present, this indicator is barely still positive at 0.39 but has been sharply trending lower recently. I believe that one reason why investors have been panicky is because of how unnecessarily tight Fed policy has become recently.\\n \\n\\nSource: St. Louis Fed The good news is everyone by now is well aware of this growing problem. The “Pinocchio Principle” applies in this case. That is, whenever a problem becomes as obvious as the nose on your face, policymakers will have a remarkably easy time identifying and responding to it. Indeed, there is still plenty of time for the Fed to recognize its mistake and announce that it will cease raising interest rates until the economy shows actual signs of inflation being a problem. Right now, inflation is far from being a legitimate concern, so higher rates aren’t needed. The sooner the Fed acknowledges this, the quicker the stock market can begin the process of healing its wounds and recovering its losses. Based on the fact that President Trump has consistently reminded Fed Chairman Powell of this policy blunder, I believe the Fed will soon rectify its error. By now you’ve probably seen plenty of graphs of the major averages illustrating the extent of the 3-month erosion in stock prices. I won’t bore you with another such example, but let’s briefly examine what I consider to be a critical chart for determining when the latest decline will bottom out. Shown below is the CBOE Volatility Index (VIX), which is one of the most popular “fear gauge” on Wall Street. \\n\\n Source: BigCharts As I’ve maintained in recent reports, the failure of the bulls to capitulate and sell out has prevented the market from establishing a solid bottom. Typically, we should see the VIX spike to an extremely high level (relative to previous highs of the last 1-2 years) to let us know when the market decline has exhausted itself. Yet despite continual declines in the Dow and SPX in December, investors never really hit the panic button. This meant that the VIX never exceeded its early February high, which in turn was made when the last major market declined bottomed out. Ideally, we should see the VIX reach or exceed the 50.00 level to let us know the last of the bulls have thrown in the towel and are no longer fighting the stock market’s decline. This would be one of the biggest signs that the bears have finished their job and that the market is ripe for a major rebound.\\n As it stands now, however, VIX only managed to reach as high as the 36.00 level in the latest decline. That’s a far cry from where volatility should be, in my opinion, especially given the magnitude of the October-December plunge. It’s also a reason why investors should brace themselves for potentially more weakness; the correction likely isn’t over yet. There is another important sign we need to see to let us know that the stock market has repaired its internal weakness and is ready to resume its long-term upward path. I’m referring to what I view as the single most important indicator of the market’s internal health, namely the new 52-week highs and lows. On the NYSE, we should see the number of stocks making new 52-week lows drastically diminish for several days running and eventually return to below 40 new lows per day. We also need to see a return of the positive new high-new low differential; that is, new highs must outnumber new lows. As it now stands, we’ve seen a negative high-low differential for several weeks on end. As long as this negative condition persists, it can be assumed that sellers still control the immediate-term (1-4 week) market trend. The indicator which I most heavily use to indicate the stock market’s near-term path of least resistance is shown here. It’s the 4-week rate of change in the NYSE 52-week highs and lows. This graph illustrates the momentum of the new highs and lows, which in turn reflects the dominant immediate-term direction of the incremental demand for equities. When this indicator is trending lower, stock prices tend to follow. A reversal in this indicator, however, will tell us that the market is ripe for a short-covering rally. \\n\\n Source: WSJ\\n Speaking of short interest, the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (SPY) leads the list of the biggest short positions right now. Interest among traders in shorting the S&P 500 is at a multi-month high, which is one indication that we’re probably very close to a major market bottom. Heading into 2019, there are many concerns facing investors. The list of worries include the threat from rising interest rates, the U.S.-China trade war, the emerging markets slowdown, and the U.S. budget deficit. Yet each of these problems is widely known and has surely been discounted by the stock market by now. What’s more, the most pressing problem facing the market is the threat of a tightening Federal Reserve monetary policy. But now that this threat has become widely bruited in the media, the Fed should have no trouble in quickly addressing it. This would have the effect of greatly calming investors’ nerves and I believe it would serve as a catalyst to a major market rebound. While growth remains on a positive trajectory and the probability is high that the large cap major averages will trend higher in the coming six months, the current investment climate isn’t yet conducive for initiating new long positions in equities. The internal condition of the stock market remains weak based on the extremely elevated number of securities making new 52-week lows on the NYSE and the Nasdaq. A defensive posture is therefore still warranted for now and investors should be mostly in cash.\\nDisclosure: I/we have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

I\\'m a buyer at this price level. There\\'s clearly a huge potential opportunity here but also a lot of uncertainty around timing. Micron gets a lot of investor coverage, and there is no end to the number of analysts and articles trying to judge how cyclical the company still is and whether the fairly new three-member DRAM oligopoly will permanently support higher DRAM margins or not. However, it\\'s clear that even the CEO of Micron can\\'t precisely predict DRAM demand and pricing over the next several quarters as global economic growth potentially slows, trade disputes between the United States and China remain unresolved, and Micron\\'s two major competitors make capex decisions. His approximate prediction from his December 18th earnings call is that the industry demand should strengthen in the second half of calendar year 2019 and that supply should come into balance around then as well, resulting in stabilized pricing. However, this estimate assumes there is no major global economic slowdown:\\n Barring weaker macroeconomic conditions, we expect our DRAM bit demand to grow sequentially in our fiscal third quarter. - Sanjay Mehrotra, Micron CEO, December 18th earnings call So, what this article focuses on is managing risk while getting exposure to what could potentially become a $100+ stock under the right conditions. The 2-Minute History The vast majority of readers already know the Micron story, but for those that don\\'t, here\\'s the short version. Micron is one of the world\\'s major producers of DRAM and NAND memory. DRAM is volatile memory, while NAND is non-volatile memory. Micron is also one of the innovators in 3D XPoint, a new type of memory that has aspects of both DRAM and NAND and is priced in between them. Over 2/3rds of Micron\\'s revenue comes from DRAM; that\\'s their most important segment by far. DRAM has always had extremely volatile pricing based on supply and demand, and despite the highly technical aspects to it, DRAM financially behaves much like a commodity with all the booms and busts associated with commodities. As a result, over the years the industry has consolidated due to various bankruptcies and acquisitions, and now three producers (Samsung, SK Hynix, and Micron) produce about 95% of all DRAM in the world: DRAM Market Share \\n\\n Source: Statistica In addition, just six producers represent virtually 100% of NAND production worldwide: NAND Market Share \\n\\n Source: Statistica\\n DRAM prices are currently in a cyclical decline, as supply has outpaced demand. The bull arguments for Micron are that its stock is extremely low-valued (price-to-earnings in the low-to-mid single digits), that DRAM demand should be slightly less volatile going forward due to the increasing variety of uses for it (cloud computing, IoT, autonomous vehicles, AI, etc), that DRAM supply should be more controlled because it now exists in an oligopoly with just three producers, and that Micron has increased its cost efficiency and has pushed further into high-value engineered solutions that are less commodity-like in nature. In addition, Sanjay Mehrotra became the CEO of Micron in 2017. Mehrotra is the co-founder and former CEO of SanDisk. As someone who personally holds many patents and has a long history in the memory industry, many investors view him as a very capable leader for Micron going forward. As described below, Mehrotra brought Micron into this cyclical decline with a stronger financial position and a potentially better game plan than the company had during the previous decline. \"It\\'s Different This Time\" (And Yet Almost the Same) Micron stock recently was well over $60 despite having a trailing price-to-earnings ratio in the low single digits. Being such a cyclical stock, the market was collectively anticipating major earnings reductions, so the trailing valuation was extremely low. In terms of price action, Micron stock has behaved similarly to how it always has. As DRAM prices have fallen, Micron\\'s stock price has collapsed. However, the good news is that Micron fundamentally is in stronger shape this time than it was during the previous few crashes. The company has paid off significant debt, and has more cash than they do debt this time around as DRAM prices fall, which gives them a nice cushion to ride out the storm: \\n\\nMU data by YCharts\\n In terms of historical valuation levels, we are near the bottom range of both price-to-book and price-to-sales ratios: \\n\\nMU Price to Tangible Book Value data by YCharts If it were to reach the stock\\'s absolute historical bottom in terms of valuation over the past decade, the likes of which it hasn\\'t seen since 2011, Micron stock could conceivably go another 20-30% lower from here into the mid/low $20s per share. That would be a true \"back up the truck\" moment for investors. However, considering that Micron is in a stronger position now than it was during previous industry downturns, that the DRAM oligopoly is more consolidated this time around, and that the company has a large share buyback plan in place, it wouldn\\'t make sense for Micron to fall much lower than where it is now. Imagine all the shares Micron is currently buying back just above tangible book value. It only makes sense for a company to remain at or below tangible book value for any significant period of time if the market thinks that the company will incur major losses and destroy shareholder value going forward. However, Micron might not have negative earnings this time around, and even if it does, historically those periods of negative earnings are brief, even back when the industry was less concentrated. This is a company that doesn\\'t really have any fundamental reason to trade at or below tangible book value for long periods of time. In terms of technicals, however, there isn\\'t necessarily a sign of a bottom yet. Historically, Micron stock bottoms around the same time that revenue growth bottoms, and that may still be a couple quarters out based on the CEO\\'s DRAM demand/supply prediction and the visible price trend:\\n \\n\\nMU data by YCharts There\\'s no guarantee though. Maybe Micron will have an abrupt V-shaped recovery this time rather than a slower U-shaped recovery because it\\'s priced for a bad DRAM trough even though the company is better-positioned than in the previous trough. A small sign of stabilizing in Micron earnings could result in an abrupt Micron stock price recovery. Or not. Overall, Micron should fundamentally be within a few dollars of its bottom, but technically anything can happen and fear and momentum could push it lower. Risks There are only a handful of fundamental long-term risks for Micron. The DRAM industry is a secular grower, as our world becomes more and more technological. Cloud computing, IoT, autonomous vehicles, and countless applications for AI and machine learning all require a lot of memory. In addition, the need for non-volatile memory is increasing, and NAND is taking market share from hard drives. For permanent capital destruction to occur at Micron, we most likely need one of two major outcomes. The first option is that Samsung, SK Hynix, or Micron become self-destructive for long periods of time, trying to capture more market share and letting DRAM prices burn. But there\\'s no sign of that. All three producers have announced plans to curtail new production going forward into 2019 due to the current supply glut. All of them have an interest in maintaining price stability and high margins. The other possibility is that we see a rise of Chinese DRAM production. China is a huge consumer of DRAM, so if China can begin making highly competitive DRAM, it would weaken the oligopoly and result in less purchasing from the 3 major suppliers. In addition, China and consequently Chinese-government-funded companies may have an interest in low DRAM prices for the foreseeable future, regardless of profit loss, and may not act rationally from a business perspective. This November article by Joe Albano here on Seeking Alpha went into more detail about the prospects of Chinese DRAM. The short version is that it would be very difficult for China to not only produce large quantities of DRAM but to also keep up technologically with the 3 major producers that are constantly investing generations ahead for better and better DRAM.\\n A Look at South Korea Investors can spread out their DRAM and NAND bets if they want. Samsung and SK Hynix are both South Korean companies while Micron is American. It\\'s amazing if you think about it that just two countries control almost 95% of worldwide DRAM production. DRAM is used in phones, computers, servers, tablets, and various devices all over the world and is essential for modern life in most countries. South Korea is currently one of the cheapest markets in the world right now, with a P/E ratio of 8.0, a forward P/E of 7.6, and a P/B of 0.94 according to MSCI. The country has moderate debt levels, plenty of foreign currency reserves, and more favorable demographics than Japan. Part of what is bringing the valuation of the South Korean stock market so low is that Samsung and SK Hynix are the two biggest pieces of the index by far, together representing about a quarter of the iShares MSCI South Korea ETF (EWY). I\\'ve long been an advocate for spreading out your international exposure, including the strategic use of single-country ETFs. Buying a little bit of EWY to complement your Micron holding may not be a bad idea. That way, you\\'ll have exposure to all major DRAM producers. Invest in Tranches, and Consider Options A lot of investors are in pain right now due to the massive fall of Micron\\'s stock price. This type of problem can be managed with disciplined buying and portfolio management. First, make sure you maintain appropriate position sizes. Enterprising investors can maintain relatively concentrated portfolios, but they should still be diverse enough that even if one of their biggest positions gets cut in half, they still don\\'t lose sleep at night. A good rule of thumb is to not put more than 5% of your portfolio into any one stock. Second, it\\'s a good idea to enter a volatile stock in tranches. Nobody knows precisely where the bottom could be, but when the fundamentals are this strong over the next 3-5 years, does the exact entry price matter? As long as one of the tail risks doesn\\'t occur, Micron should be very well positioned from here. Spread your bets out and approximate the bottom rather than try to catch the exact bottom.\\n For example, I\\'ve watched Micron stock since it was in the $50s and $60s and waited. I wasn\\'t sure how cyclical it would be this time around, so I put it in my \"too hard pile\" for the time being and just watched. Then as it fell substantially, I nibbled at a cost basis of just under $36. Now that it has fallen further, it\\'s out of my \"too hard pile\" and firmly into clear undervalued territory, so I\\'m planning to double my position. This also happens to be a great stock for selling put options on, which makes building positions even more automatic. If you want to start your Micron position, or increase your existing Micron position, here\\'s an example recommendation that you can tailor to your own needs.  Buy some shares now, just above tangible book value. It\\'s a great price to buy and hold at it you can withstand the volatility. In addition, sell some March 15th puts at a strike price of $28. This will pre-obligate you to increase your position at a cost basis below tangible book value if Micron keeps falling, and will produce a smart buying plan on autopilot. At $1.67 per contract as of this writing, this will result in a cost basis of $26.33 if assigned, or give you a 6.3% return in less than three months if not assigned.  \\n\\n Source: Author\\'s Work in Excel Then, watch and evaluate. You\\'ll have a solid position, and depending on what happens in 2019, you\\'ll either fill your full position or be able to sell more puts. Another method is to just start dollar cost averaging into it now. Buy a big tranche now, and then as you have new money available to invest as Micron remains in a trough, buy smaller tranches to fill your full position. Always manage your position size so that it doesn\\'t dominate your portfolio.\\n This is a challenging stock that drives strong emotions, but as it trades near tangible book value, I believe the upside potential dramatically outweighs the downside risks for investors that are patient enough to hold for the next several years.\\nDisclosure: I am/we are long MU.

INTU's forward P/E is 28.57, while CRM's is 47.14.Xero, which leads the Asia Pacific market for tax and accounting software and grows at 47% YoY, could be a strategic takeover target for Intuit to expand into Asia.\"], 'article': [\"Thesis Through their flagship products such as TurboTax and QuickBooks, Intuit (INTU) has been the dominant accounting and tax preparation software providers in United States. Xero (OTCMKTS: XROLF), on the other hand, started out in New Zealand and Australia as a small business accounting software provider in 2008 and expanded into United States in 2011. We see Intuit as a growth stock. However, as the company expects to grow slower in the next 12 months, entering the emerging market could provide a reasonable way to unlock growth opportunity. This is why we believe that Xero would be a strategic takeover target for Intuit. The potential acquisition will allow Intuit to expand into fast-growing Asia Pacific market, where Xero is a much more dominant player. Intuit has grown 12.49% while Xero 46.58% YoY on average in the last 3 years. We believe that accounting and tax preparation software market faces a few barriers to entries that would make it difficult for overseas players to enter. For instance, a high degree of tailoring to a specific accounting or tax software is required to account for differences in languages and reporting standards. On that basis alone, the acquisition provides the most strategic path to expand into a new market and exponential growth. Asia Pacific market outlook and drivers Cloud tax preparation and accounting software adoptions have increased significantly in emerging regions such as Southeast Asia and some parts of East Asia. Some fast-growing regions in Asia Pacific like Southeast Asia have been known to be very diverse in terms of economic development and regulatory policies. However, we've seen that the member countries in the region have gotten more integrated in recent years. Barriers for trade deals and labor movements among its members have significantly reduced. In addition, we've observed that the less developed member countries have successfully revamped their fiscal and other national security policies to level the playing field. Regulations have gotten significantly stricter, for instance, when it comes to tax reporting and collections. This increasingly stricter policies and more mature economic developments will drive the adoption for cloud tax preparation and accounting software.\\n Based in New Zealand and Australia, Xero is the largest player in the region with the closest proximity to the rest of the fast-growing countries in Asia Pacific. We believe that the regions will reward the early trailblazers. In Southeast Asia, we've seen private equity and leading venture capital firms like Warburg Pincus and Sequoia Capital leading $28.5 million growth stage investments in a tax preparation software company in the region. The company has reportedly processed over $8 billion of tax returns to date. Moving the needle Much of Intuit's Q1 2018 - Q1 2019 YoY 12% revenue growth has been driven by their Small Business & Self-Employed segment. This segment contributes $908 million of overall $1 billion revenue as of Q1 FY 2019. Some product lines in the segment include QuickBooks financial and business management software, payroll solutions, and merchant payment processing solutions. 92% of Intuit's overall revenue is also made up of Small Business & Self-Employed and Consumer segments, both driven by their Quickbooks and TurboTax products. In their financial reports, Intuit only reports segments that makeup of at least 8% of total net revenue. \\n\\n Source: Intuit 10-K Filing Aug 31 2018. International segment, which makes up 5% of the total net revenue, is not included. That is where Intuit has a lot of room to grow. Intuit's Quickbooks online product has about 3.4 million subscribers as of today, or up 43% YoY. But, Xero acquisition would allow Intuit to increase their number of subscribers by 47% to 5 million and to expand to Asia Pacific market. \\n\\n\\n Source: Xero presentation slideshow as of August 2018. Xero has had a very strong Q3 performance. Besides having grown their number of subscribers by more than 30% in the last twelve months, we also see that their cash flow generation has improved significantly in the last three years. Valuation By looking at the other comparable companies in the cloud software market, we think that Xero is fairly valued. \\n\\n Source: Author. Comparison of relative valuation metrics for Intuit and Xero. One thing we noticed is the similarity between the market valuation for Xero and Zendesk (ZEN), despite their obvious difference in sizes. With $7.5 billion market cap, Zendesk is about twice the size of Xero. However, Zendesk is also at a similar level of growth and earnings to Xero. As it stands, Xero still has negative earnings due to its high growth rate. Zendesk, on the other hand, also hasn't had positive earnings until the recent quarter due to the same reason. \\n\\n Source: Author. Market cap comparison of all Intuit and Xero comparable companies. CRM products like Zendesk and Salesforce (CRM) would have an easier time to expand across geographic without needing a high degree of localization or tailoring on its software. As we've mentioned, this won't be the case for accounting and tax software providers like Intuit and Xero. This becomes clear when we look at the forward P/E ratio and size of Salesforce vs Intuit. Looking at the forward P/E ratios for both companies, we see that investors have a higher expectation of Salesforce growing faster than Intuit despite their size. However, the real opportunity lies in the fact that accounting and tax software has a higher switching cost than CRM products. With a market price of $3.81 billion, we think that Intuit can easily finance the acquisition through debt issuance and cash. Servicing the debt won't be a big issue. Xero has recently had a positive operating cash flow last quarter. In addition, Intuit's cash flow generation has been very strong and remained at 10% growth YoY. Last year, Intuit generated $2.1 billion of cash flow from operations.\\n Conclusion We think Intuit can unlock higher growth opportunity by entering a faster-growing market like Asia Pacific. In stark contrast to other cloud business software like CRM, an accounting, tax, and HR software provider like Intuit faces a certain challenge when they try to expand their services overseas. Due to different reporting standards and country-specific regulations, such software typically requires a high degree of localization in terms of features and potentially pricing in order to gain adoption in certain overseas markets. Being based in the region already, Xero could provide that access for Intuit for $3.8 billion.\\nDisclosure: I am/we are long VGT. I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions.

Pure Health operates as a provider of office filtered water coolers and related products. WAAS stock has avoided the stock market swoon in recent quarters and is nearing its 52-week high, so may be a relatively safe equity for investors seeking lower volatility. Target Company Lincolnshire, Illinois-based Pure Health was founded in 1996 to develop Pure Water Technology filters. Management is headed by CEO Bob Tangredi, who has been with the firm since 2013 and was previously Corporate Vice President and GM - Communication Solutions. Below is an overview video of PHSI’s business:  Source: Pure Water Technology The company currently rents and services about 13,000 owned units to commercial end users throughout the US and sells water coolers and related filtration systems through a network of over 90 distributors. Pure Health’s primary offerings include:  Office Water Coolers Office Ice Makers Office Coffee Service \\n Market & Competition According to a market research report by Technavio, the global water coolers market is projected to grow by $521 million between 2017 and 2022. The represents a CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) of 7% during the forecast period. The main driver for this expected growth is the growing adoption of water coolers in commercial spaces. The Asia-Pacific region accounted for the largest share of global demand - 45% - in 2017 and is projected to continue to dominate the market during the forecast period. \\n\\n Source: Technavio Acquisition Terms and Rationale AquaVenture disclosed the acquisition price as $57.6 million in all cash consideration. Around the same time as the announcement, management announced an increase in its credit facility by $40 million, so I presume they are drawing that amount down and paying the rest from cash on hand or other loan facility availability. In an investor call about the transaction, management outlined the change to 2019 financial guidance as follows, We estimate that PHSI will contribute between $21 million and $23 million in revenue in 2019 with approximately 40% of the revenue derived from the direct rental business and 50% from the indirect dealer book. We also estimate that PHSI will contribute between $8 million and $9 million in adjusted EBITDA for the fiscal year 2019, and we expect to direct and indirect businesses to contribute about equally to this adjusted EBITDA total. A review of the firm’s most recent 10-Q filing indicates that as of September 30, 2018, it has $93.6 million in cash and equivalents and $209 million in total liabilities. Free cash flow during the nine months ended September 30, 2018, was $9.1 million. Quench acquired Pure Health as a complement to its rental business.\\n As AquaVenture President Tony Ibarguen stated in the investor conference call, It's [Pure Health] complimentary to our core business, which is the rental business. And that's still will be 70% to 75% of the total revenue and more of the EBITDA of the Quench unit, in general. But it does give us very beneficial exposure to hundreds of other competing dealers in the marketplace, which not only extends our influence over the industry, it increases our sourcing capability to reduce our overall cost of the product that we buy given the volumes that we're able to procure. In the past 12 months, WAAS’ stock price has risen 19.5% vs. the S&P 500 Index’ drop of(9.6%), as the chart below indicates: \\n\\n Source: Seeking Alpha AquaVenture has had a mixed record of positive and negative earnings surprises over the most recent eight quarters, as the graphic shows below, \\n\\n Source: Seeking Alpha Analyst ratings remain positive while the stock is currently trading at a nearly 28% discount to the consensus price target: \\n\\n Source: Seeking Alpha AquaVenture’s stock has largely been spared the worst of the recent stock market drop and is nearly at its 52-week high.\\n For investors seeking a relatively safe equity haven in the current highly volatile stock market, WAAS could be a reasonable choice.\\nThank you for reading.

Exxon Mobil\\'s (NYSE:XOM) FPSO Liza 2 project is SBFFY\\'s primary growth driver. Following its investigation with the Brazilian authorities and Petrobras (NYSE:PBR), SBFFY has cut down its exposure to Brazil in the past year. SBM Offshore has strong cash flows and liquidity. Given its healthy dividend yield, SBFFY can be a long-term investment, if it starts winning contracts in Brazil again. In 2018 so far, the stock price has gone down by 21% compared to a 48% fall in the VanEck Vectors Oil Services ETF (OIH). OIH represents the oilfield equipment & services (OFS) industry. What are SBM Offshore\\'s recent drivers? \\n\\n SBM Offshore owns and operates Floating Production, Storage and Offloading (FPSO) vessels. It also leases them to its clients or supplied on a turnkey sale basis. The company had an operating fleet of 14 FPSOs, two Floating Storage and Offloading (FSO) vessels, one Mobile Offshore Production Unit (MOPU) and one semi-submersible by the end of FY2017. In the first half of FY2018, the company\\'s revenues declined by 3% compared to the first half of FY2017 due to the negative impacts from FPSO Turritella leaving the fleet. FPSO Turritella joined the feet in 2017 in the US Gulf of Mexico\\'s tertiary fields. The Turnkey segment witnessed a 71% increase in revenues, while the Lease and Operate segment revenues declined by 12% during this period. The turnaround in Turkey\\'s results was led by construction activities related to FPSO Liza and the Johan Castberg Turret Mooring System EPC. The Lease and Operate segment is SBM Offshore\\'s primary operation, accounting for 81% of its 1H 2018 revenues.\\n EBITDA, on the other hand, increased considerably in 1H 2018 over the previous year. EBITDA gain from the Turnkey segment was notable in 2018, as the segment turned around from $23 million loss in 1H 2017 to generating a remarkable $250 million segment EBITDA in 1H 2018. This primarily resulted from $233 million EBITDA realized from the sale of FPSO Turritella and the net impact of an additional settlement for the YME insurance claim. Initially, the company had received settlement proceeds from the insurance claim in Q3 2017. The insurance recoveries related to the Yme project represent a total amount close to $390 million, which includes a final increment of $48.5 million. However, the insurance recoveries will be shared equally between SBM Offshore and Repsol (OTCQX:REPYY). Excluding the gains, 1H 2018 EBITDA in the Turnkey segment was still positive ($17 million). Earlier, in FY2017, although SBFFY\\'s total revenues declined by 18% over the previous year, the company did not reduce its offshore drilling fleet asset. Its two Generation 3 FPSOs offshore Brazil increased production. Most of its units in the fleet operated around 99% uptime. However, Deep Panuke - a MOPU - had an interruption of its gas production in June for maintenance activities. SBFFY\\'s EPC operation in natural gas production \\n\\n SBFFY is also active in pilot Engineering Procurement and Construction (EPC) stages for the natural gas production as the industry looks to transition from crude oil production and increase its dependence on this form of energy production. SBM Offshore has built a track record in turret mooring solutions for floating gas systems. In FY2017, two complex turret mooring systems were commissioned and delivered.\\n Now, the company is targeting both newbuild and conversion floating liquefied natural gas (FLNG) solutions. According to the EIA, natural gas production is expected to account for nearly 40% of U.S. energy production by 2040. Natural gas trade is projected to be increasingly dominated by liquefied natural gas (LNG) exports. Higher production will also require increased infrastructure needs to supply the gas. This will increase the need for natural gas compression, thereby increasing the requirement for gas compression and related products and services. In this context, read the analysis on Natural Gas Services (NSG) here. Backlog and new projects In July, SBM received FPSO Liza 2 contracts from Exxon Mobil to perform Front End Engineering and Design (FEED) for a second FPSO. This represented the company\\'s largest and first Fast4Ward FPSO. This brings us SBM\\'s premier product Fast4Ward, which is new build, multi-purpose hull combined with several standardized topsides modules. Fast4Ward helps reduce project cycle time, which according to the company\\'s estimates, translates into $1 billion of NPV gain at the most. Because of its standardized hull and topsides, it has an effect of de-risking projects. Now, SBFFY is mulling the next phase contracts in installing a second hull in the project. Regarding this, the company\\'s executives have recently commented in the recent trading update: \"The contract is progressing well and the fabrication of the first well as well. Now with the second hull in place, it means that multiple customers have confirmed their interest with FEED studies and that is the practical decision to take to support their position needs on targeted fields. Our ambition remains for Fast4Ward to be a program and to transform the FPSO industry.\" The other opportunity for SBFFY opens up after signing of the leniency agreement with authorities in Brazil and Petrobras in July 2018. This has enabled the company to compete in new tenders for Petrobras in Brazil. In a bullish case, SBFFY\\'s management expects up to 10 contracts in 2018. In Brazil, SBFFY has delivered 15 units until now, and it has seven FPSOs in operation in Brazil. The company assists in ~25% of the total Brazilian offshore crude oil production and 40% of the pre-salt daily output.\\n What are SBMFF\\'s primary concerns? While the oil price began to recover steadily during 2017, it could not sustain the uptick and has started sliding down again. In the past two months, the WTI crude oil price has declined by 37%. If the current industry downturn continues, the demand for offshore services may be impacted with cancelation or delay of planned investments, leading to an adverse effect on SBM Offshore\\'s new order intake. \\n\\n SBM Offshore has a particular concentration of business activities in Brazil and, to a lesser extent, Angola. In 1H 2017, Brazil accounted for 61% of SBM Offshore\\'s geographic revenue share. The company thus has portfolio risks which may increase the impact of changes in local legislative and business environments, potentially affecting its business results. SBM Offshore has a prolonged investigation with the Brazilian authorities concerning alleged improper sales practices before 2012. In September 2018, a leniency agreement was authorized by the Brazilian authorities. SBM has reduced its exposure to Brazil, which accounted for 49% of its revenues in the first half of 2018. FY 2018 Guidance \\n\\n As the guidance suggests, the estimated revenue decline in the Lease and Operate segment in FY2018 over the prior year will be more than compensated by higher revenues from the Turnkey segment. I have already discussed the value drivers in my article. Investors should also note that this guidance assumes 100% of Liza Destiny ownership and the expected positive impact from the implementation of IFRS 16. IFRS 16 refers to a single lessee accounting model, requiring lessees to recognize assets and liabilities unless the lease term is 12 months. Following the adoption, SBM Offshore\\'s EBITDA will increase by approximately $35 million in 2018. It will also affect the cash flow statement. The guidance does not take into account the gain on sale of FPSO Turritella, the provision for the leniency agreement with the Brazilian authority, and the estimated net positive impact in 2018 from the Yme settlement.\\n Dividend yield SBFFY pays an annual dividend of $0.24 per share. This equates to forward dividend yield of 1.77%. Its dividend has grown by 2.5% in the past year. SBFFY has strong cash flows In the first half of FY2018, SBM Offshore generated ~$1.3 billion in cash flow from operations (or CFO). In 1H 2018, SBFFY\\'s cash flow increased 228% over the prior year. The cash flow improvement reflects higher revenues and strong operating cash flow from the Lease and Operate activity. Its capex was not significant in the first six months of FY2018. Cash and cash equivalents were $910 million on June 30, 2018. Regarding dividend policy and share buyback, the management commented: \"And we still got the $1 billion as yet and an undrawn loan so far on Liza 1. And what this means is that we can maintain our policy, which is prioritizing the dividend and consideration of shareholder returns. And I think, as you know, the policy is to keep the dividend stable and grow it over time, where we look at the underlying cash flow outlook. So yes, where we are at the moment in the - we\\'re in the process of finalizing our plans for next year.\" The disposal of FPSO Turritella has resulted in a reduction of the company\\'s net debt by $463 million compared to 2017 year-end. Per its FY 2017 annual report, the company had $724 million of debt repayment at the end of 2018. SBFFY has $1 billion revolving credit facility, which can be extended to $1.25 billion. Given its strong cash flow from operations and liquidity, the company will have no difficulty in meeting its short-term financial obligations, capex, and dividend. It is not likely to face significant debt repayments in the next three to four years. What does SBFFY\\'s relative valuation say? \\n\\n\\n SBM Offshore is currently trading at an EV-to-adjusted EBITDA multiple of 12.2x. According to sell-side analysts\\' estimates pulled from Thomson Reuters, the forward EV/EBITDA multiple is 9.3x. From FY2012 to FY2017, the average EV/EBITDA multiple was 11.3x. So, the company is currently trading at a premium to its past six-year average. SBM Offshore\\'s forward EV-to-EBITDA multiple contraction versus its adjusted trailing twelve-month EV/EBITDA is steeper compared to the industry peers\\' average multiple compression. This is because SBFFY\\'s EBITDA is expected to improve more sharply compared to the peers\\' average in the next four quarters. This would typically reflect in a higher current EV/EBITDA multiple compared to the peers\\' average. SBFFY\\'s TTM EV/EBITDA multiple is higher than its peers\\' (OTCPK:WDGJF, FTI, and OTCPK:SAPMY) average of 6.9x. Analysts\\' rating on SBFFY \\n\\n According to data provided by Seeking Alpha, seven sell-side analysts rated SBFFY a \"buy\" in December; three recommended a \"hold\", while two recommended \"underperform\". The analysts\\' consensus target price for SBFFY is $20.6, which at its current price yields ~51% returns. What\\'s the take on SBFFY? Given crude oil price\\'s current weakness and the long-term shift towards natural gas production from crude oil, SBFFY is molding its business structure. Its catalyst lies in Exxon Mobil\\'s FPSO Liza 2 FEED project. With half of its FPSO assets invested in Brazil, the company\\'s exposure to Brazil has been significant. Following its long-standing investigation with the Brazilian authorities and Petrobras, SBFFY has cut down its exposure to Brazil in the past year. Despite the recent troubles, the signing of the leniency agreement with authorities in Brazil and Petrobras in July 2018 may allow SBFFY to take part in its energy production growth again. SBM Offshore has strong cash flows and liquidity, which comfortably covers its debt repayments and capex needs. Given its healthy dividend yield, SBFFY is likely staying steady in the medium-to-long term. However, investors looking for growth should wait to see how the Brazilian market pans out for the company.\\n\\nDisclosure: I/we have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

TDFs have become riskier since 2008: bond holdings are longer duration (more volatile) and allocations to equities have increased. Is that the reaction you expected? Progress on the regulatory front could help remedy this increase, with your proposed prudence standards that require consultants to hold client best interests above their own, but it depends on your definition of “client.” There are two possible definitions of “client” in TDFs. As a practical matter, plan sponsors are the clients because they hire consultants and pay their bills. Sponsor best interests are served when all the legal work is properly completed and maintained. The other possible definition of “client” is the beneficiaries of the TDFs because they bear the investment risk. Beneficiary best interests are served when their stated needs are met. Beneficiaries say they want to be protected as they near retirement – they do not want to lose money, including those who have recovered from 2008. Please make it clear that TDF beneficiaries are the “clients.” These clients want to be protected from investment losses as they near retirement and they think they are being protected, but they are not. A recent MassMutual Retirement Savings Risk Study reports beneficiary risk preferences in 401(k) plans, and finds that the vast majority (83%) want to be protected from losses at the target date. Interestingly, a PIMCO survey of consultants (“2018 12th Annual DC Consulting Support & Trends Survey”) agrees with this safety preference. The interesting, and puzzling, fact is consultants are not choosing safe TDFs. They’re not putting their money where their mouth is.\\n “Safety” can be a matter of judgment. TDF providers have to trade off the desire to grow assets against the need to protect them. In 2008 most 2010 funds lost more than 25%, and the judgment at that time was that these losses were unacceptable. TDFs were judged to be unsafe, so your hearings were held. Now they are even more unsafe. Consequently, beneficiary best interests are not being served. It’s important to recognize that TDFs are mostly selected by consultants on behalf of plan sponsors. \\n\\n Here are the details of average TDF allocations at the target date. The typical TDF is allocated 97% to risky assets at the target date. But not all TDFs are this risky. Some are much safer, invested 90% in Treasury bills and short term TIPS at the target date, but these funds are rarely considered in TDF selection proceedings. Are consultants fulfilling their duty of care in their selection of TDFs? They are not if the “clients” are beneficiaries, which they should be. Why do consultant surveys express a preference for safety at the target date when they in fact select unsafe TDFs?\\nDisclosure: I/we have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

A new Chairman of the Federal Reserve and changes in the composition at the FOMC caused concerns to increase that the central bank would take a more hawkish approach to credit in the United States. Meanwhile, the program of reducing the Fed\\'s balance sheet from the legacy of quantitative easing caused the fear of rising interest rate to weigh on stock prices. The E-Mini S&P 500 futures contract declined from a record high at 2878.50 during the week of January 29 to a low at 2529 during the following week of February 5, a drop of 12.14%. As had happened so many times over the past years, stocks came roaring back. While they took an elevator down in early February, equities took the stairs higher reaching a new and higher peak at 2944 on the E-Mini during the week of September 17. After sitting around the highs until the second week of October, a traditionally troublesome month for stocks, the downside volatility returned to the market. After three interest rate hikes in 2018, the Fed provided guidance that another was coming at their December meeting. Despite pleas from many market participants and stern objections from the White House, Chairman Powell, and his colleagues unanimously agreed to increase the Fed Funds rate for the fourth time at their December 19 meeting igniting more selling in an already weak stock market. The Fed Funds rate at 2.25-2.50% was not what the market wanted to see. Stocks fell from the mid-September high to close at the 2441 level on December 21, a move of over 17% lower in the E-Mini contract. The VIX index closed on December 24 at over 36, the highest level since February, and VIX related derivatives like the iPath S&P 500 VIX ST Futures ETN product (VXX) exploded higher.\\n No respite from selling, even on Christmas Eve After selling for seven consecutive sessions in the leadup and aftermath of the December Fed meeting where the central bank disappointed equity investors, some held out a fleeting hope that on Christmas Eve, the holiday-shortened session in the stock market would yield some rebound so that they could enjoy the holiday on an optimistic note. Those investors got nothing more than a lump of coal in their Christmas stocking on December 24. \\n\\n Source: CQG As the daily chart highlights, Christmas Eve turned out to be the eighth consecutive session of significant losses in the stock market with the E-Mini futures contract falling to 2342.25, 20.4% below its mid-September peak and in what many call bear market territory as it is over 20% lower than the recent peak. On Christmas Eve, the DJIA fell by 2.91%, the S&P 500 was down 2.71%, and the NASDAQ declined 2.21%. When market participants begin to allude to the daily performance of the stock indices in percentage terms during sell-offs, it is a sign of risk-off behavior, and the price action frayed nerves going into the Christmas holiday and the finals sessions of 2018 in the stock market and markets across all asset classes. The President continues to blame the Fed Throughout his first two years in office, President Trump developed a pattern of using stock market performance as the report card of his progress in fulfilling pledges made on the campaign trail in 2016. Tax and regulatory reforms lifted the prices of stocks as they turbocharged corporate earnings. Even the administration\\'s aggressive posture on trade with China and other partners around the world did not slow down the ascent of the stock market over the majority of 2018. However, the first inkling that something was wrong in stocks came from the June Fed meeting when Chairman Powell and the other members of the FOMC told markets that economic data over GDP growth and unemployment had been so good they added another 25 basis point rate hike to their agenda for 2018. After the September Fed meeting which was the time of the third move to hike interest rates, the prospects for another increase began to weigh on the minds of investors and stocks began to slip. At the same time, the QT program was putting upward pressure on rates in the medium and long ends of the yield curve.\\n President Trump did not like what he saw from the Fed, and he called their tightening \"crazy.\" In the lead up to the December meeting, the commander-in-chief suggested that the Fed should pause as their hawkish approach to monetary policy was not only working counter to his administration\\'s victories when it came to tax and regulatory reforms, but it was harming negotiations with the Chinese when it comes to a new framework for trade. The Fed is an apolitical body, and it ignored the President and other market leaders stating that the central bank only responds to economic data. After hiking rates on December 19 and suggesting that they are on course for two more increases in the Fed Funds rate in 2019, the President blamed the central bank for the current volatility in the stock market using a golf analogy. \\n\\n Source: Twitter The stock market that had been a big supporter of the President given the gains is now plunging, and the Oval Office is not happy with the central bank. Meanwhile, the Fed\\'s rate hike may have contributed to selling in the stock market, but the lack of agreement on a Federal budget became another issue that turned out to be a problem for stocks. A government shutdown was a bearish cherry on top of a falling knife In the aftermath of the midterm elections in the United States, the opposition Democratic Party took control of the House of Representatives. While the Republicans increased their majority in the Senate, the change in the legislative branch will stand as a roadblock for the President\\'s agenda and could even threaten his continuation in office given the many investigations, indictments, and guilty pleas over the recent weeks and months. Last Friday, with a Republican majority in both the House and Senate until the end of this year, the President and the Congress could not agree on a deal to keep the government up and running for the coming weeks and months. The President insisted on funding for a border wall to keep his pledge to secure the southern border of the United States. Without an agreement or compromise, a partial government shutdown took effect at midnight on Saturday, December 22. When the stock market opened on Christmas Eve, the government shutdown during the holidays was just another cherry on top of an already bearish cocktail for the stock market.\\n In itself, the partial shutdown is not a reason for the stock market to tank. However, it is a preview of what is coming to Washington DC in early 2019 and a highly contentious relationship between the House and President Trump with the Mueller report coming out could ignite even more selling in the weeks ahead. Every piece of news seems to cause selling- A bearish sign One sign of a bear market is when any news causes selling. When markets move into a downward trend and spiral, even positive news cannot prop up prices. A recent example comes from the oil market which has been a falling knife since early October. The price of the energy commodity continued to decline following the decision by OPEC and the Russians to cut output by 1.2 million bpd on December 7. Oil fell below $50 per barrel and was under $43 on Christmas Eve. Last weekend, Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin called the CEOs of all of the leading financial institutions in the United States to inject optimism into the falling stock market by demonstrating that liquidity remains at acceptable levels despite the price action in equities. The market responded with another 2% decline in all of the leading indices on the holiday-shortened December 24 session. One of the problems facing stocks is that any positive news could be few and far between over the coming days and months. Aside from a hawkish Fed, partial government shutdown, hostile House of Representatives and the potential for additional tidbits from the special prosecutor, the trade dispute with China is an issue that threatens global economic growth. If that is not enough, a wave of bearish contagion on the back of the ongoing saga between the UK and EU over Brexit could hand the stock market more excuses for selling over the coming weeks. Finally, with only a few trading sessions to go in 2018, the potential for tax-loss selling and risk-off behavior in the stock market is elevated, and traders and investors are preparing for the uncertainty of 2019 which is likely to keep volatility high, and trading ranges wide.\\n There will be bargains over the coming weeks During periods where volatility rises, opportunities abound. A falling knife in the stock market causes indiscriminate selling which results in bargains for the brave souls willing to take a longer-term view of markets from 30,000 feet and ignore the short-term fear and uncertainty that causes prices to plunge. Those of you who have been following my pieces about the stock market over the past months known that I have been buying VIX-related instruments on price dips when volatility declines and taking profits during periods like we are witnessing over recent sessions. The iPath S&P 500 VIX ST Futures ETN product (VXX) is only appropriate for short-term positions in the stock market, but it acts like a put option that can enhance trading performance and protect stock portfolios during times when the market is plunging. The fund summary for VXX states: The investment seeks to provide investors with exposure to the S&P 500 VIX Short-Term Futures™ Index Total Return. The S&P 500 VIX Short-Term Futures™ Index Total Return (the \\'index\\') is designed to provide access to equity market volatility through CBOE Volatility Index® futures. The index offers exposure to a daily rolling long position in the first and second month VIX futures contracts and reflects the implied volatility of the S&P 500® at various points along the volatility forward curve. The price for leverage is time decay which makes VXX a very short-term tool. Since the high on December 19, the day of the Fed meeting, the E-Mini S&P 500 futures contract dropped from 2592 to 2342.25 on December 24, a decline of 9.6%. \\n\\n Source: Barchart Over the same period, VXX moved from $40.60 to $49.35, a rise of 21.6% as the leveraged ETN product offer a percentage return that was double the performance of a short position in the E-Mini futures contract. I rarely hold positions in VXX or other VIX-related products for longer than two weeks.\\n As we head into 2019, many issues on the horizon favor a continuation of market volatility in stocks. The optimal approach to the stock market for decades has been to buy scale-down during periods of fear and uncertainty when the market is taking the elevator shaft to the downside. However, this time could be different. I am scouring the market to look for bargains in companies where the fundamentals support a recovery in share prices. However, risk-off means that everything with a symbol tends to move significantly lower. When the market returned from the Christmas holiday on Wednesday, stocks bounced higher and the VIX dropped but remained above the 33 level as I post this piece. Markets rarely move in a straight line and the start of 2019 is likely to be a continuation of the bumpy ride we have been on at the end of 2018. Happy New Year and be careful out there in markets across all asset classes, the current environment feels different than during past sell-offs.\\nThe Hecht Commodity Report is the most comprehensive commodities reports available today from the top-ranked ranked author in both commodities, forex, and precious metals.

Cohen is a known shorter-term trader and likely sold over the past two weeks after the weak Q3 performance. \\n\\n Worse-than-expected financial performance for the quarter ending November 2018 helps create this investable opportunity. Three factors impacted the weak quarter three performance: redirected event promotion, continued poor UK sales, and lack of new kid-friendly films. A strategic decision to limit planned marketing for September 2018 is redirected to a new event for January. The move is motivated by unexpected overwhelming consumer response to July\\'s \"Pay Your Age\" promotion. Massive consumer response created long waiting lines and increased media attention. Although management believes there are long-term benefits from the 3 billion media impressions from the Pay Your Age initiative. The proximity and historical lines of prior National Teddy Bear Day promotion forced management to move September\\'s event to manage potential negative consumer and brand-damaging event coverage. The changes made to National Teddy Bear Day resulted in lower third-quarter sales. Now the goal is to recoup lost business with a similar event on National Hug Day before this year\\'s 2018 fiscal year end in January.\\n A deceleration in European revenues, driven by a double-digit decline in year-over-year sales in the United Kingdom.

Although anticipated, the negative impact was greater than forecast. Positives going into the last quarter of 2018. Launched intellectual products include top-selling Beary Fairy Friends and Rainbow Friends.

Additional positives for 2019 include a promising kid-friendly movie line-up: \"How to Train Your Dragon,\" Aladdin, Lion King and the second installment of Frozen. New films drive family traffic to theaters located at the mall. Consumers attracted by \"Pay Your Age Day\" leveraged for future.

The latest raise by the US Fed resulted in a very clear price decline in the markets, illustrating the fact that investors don\\'t expect the markets to recover based on the current geopolitical and economic climate. Over 5 years ago, our research team developed a financial modeling system that attempted to model the US Fed Funds Rate optimal levels given certain inputs (US GDP, US population, US debt, and others).

The basic premise of our modeling system is that as long as the Fed keeps rates within our model\\'s optimal output parameters, the US (and presumably global) economy should continue to operate without massive disruption events, unless some outside event (think Europe, China or another massive economic collapse) disrupts the ability of the US economy from operating efficiently.

This model operates on the premise that US debt, population, and GDP will continue to increase at similar levels to those in 2004-2012. We can see that our model predicted that the US Fed should have begun raising rates in 2013-2014 and continued to push rates above 1.25% before the end of 2015. Then, the US Fed should have raised rates gradually to near 2.0% by 2017-2018, never breaching the 2.1250% level. Our model expects the US Fed to decrease rates to near 1.4-1.5% in early 2019 and for rates to rotate between 1.25% and 2.0% between now and 2020. Eventually, after 2021, our model expects the US Fed to begin to normalize rates near 1.5-1.75% for an extended period of time. \\n\\n\\n Additionally, our Custom Market Cap index has reached a very low level (historically extremely low) and is likely to result in a major price bottom formation or, at least, a pause in this downward price move that may result in some renewed forward optimism going forward. Although we would like to be able to announce that the market has reached a major price bottom and that we are \"calling a bottom\" in this move, we simply can\\'t call this as a bottom yet. We have to wait to see if and when the markets confirm a price bottom before we can\\'t attempt any real call in the markets. You can see from our Custom Market Cap Index that the index level is very near historically low levels (below $4.00 - near the red line) and that these levels have resulted in major price low points historically. We are expecting the price to pause over the next week or so near these $3.50 levels and attempt to set up a rotational support level before attempting another price swing. As of right now, we believe there is fairly strong opportunity for a price bottom to set up, yet these are still very early indicators of a major price bottom and we can\\'t actually call a bottom yet. If our Custom Market Cap Index does as it has in the past, then we are very close to a bottom formation in the US markets, and traders would be wise to wait for technical confirmation of this bottom before jumping into any aggressive long trades. \\n\\n Lastly, our Custom Global Market Cap Index has also reached levels near the lower deviation channel range over the past 7+ years, which adds further confidence that a potential price bottom may be near to forming in the US markets. As we can see from the chart below, the recent selloff has pushed our Global Market Cap Index to very low levels - from near $198 to near $144, a -27.55% total price decline. Nearing these low levels, we should expect the global markets to attempt to find some support and to potentially hammer out a bottom, yet we are still cautious that this downward price move could breach existing support levels and push even further into bear market territory.\\n \\n\\n There are early warning signs that the market may be attempting to form a market bottom, and our research team is scanning every available tool we have at our disposal to attempt to assist all of our members and followers. We alerted you to this move back on September 17, 2018, with our ADL predictive modeling system call for a -5-8%+ market correction. Little did we know that the US Fed would blow the bottom out of the markets with its push to raise rates above the 2.0% level. As the US Fed has already breached our Fed Modeling Systems suggested rate levels, the global markets will be attempting to identify key price support in relation to this new pricing pressure, and the expectations that debt/credit issues will become more pronounced as rates push higher. In other words, the global markets are attempting to price in the renewed uncertainty that relates to the US Fed pushing rates beyond optimal levels. We expect the markets are close to finding true support near the levels we\\'ve shown on our Custom Index charts, yet we still need confirmation before we can call it a bottom. We will continue to update you with our research and analysis as this move plays out, and we hope you were able to follow our analysis regarding the Metals, Oil, Energy and other sectors that called many of these massive price swings. We pride ourselves on our analysis and ability to use our proprietary tools to find and execute successful trades for our members. Our ADL predictive price modeling system is still suggesting an upward price move is in the works for the US markets, and we are waiting for our \"ultimate low price\" level to be reached before we expect an upside leg to drive prices higher again. Based on our current research, we may be nearing the point where the markets attempt to hammer out a price bottom - yet, time will tell if this is the correct analysis.\\n\\n']}\n"

The price of the energy commodity declined from $76.90 on October 3 to its latest low at $42.36 on Christmas Eve. Rising U.S. production, economic weakness in China, a falling U.S. stock market, the trade dispute between the U.S. and China, and a strong dollar have combined to create a potent bearish cocktail for the price of the energy commodity. Crude oil is a benchmark commodity, but other bellwether raw materials began falling long before the price of oil turned lower. The price of the illiquid lumber market halved in price since the May record high at $659 per 1,000 board feet. Copper, a commodity that tends to diagnose the health and wellbeing of the global economy declined from over $3.30 per pound in June to its current level around $2.70. In the world of crude oil, the two benchmark prices are West Texas Intermediate that comes from North America and Brent North Sea crude that serves as the pricing mechanism for petroleum from Europe, Africa, and the Middle East. Approximately two-thirds of the world's crude oil use Brent for pricing while the other one-third employs the WTI price. As the price of the energy commodity moved lower, the level of the Brent-WTI spread remained remarkably stable. A location and a quality spread The Brent-WTI spread is a critical location and quality spread in the crude oil market. It is a location spread because Brent represents the oil from the Brent North Seas oilfields, and WTI is the oil that is for delivery at the NYMEX hub at Cushing, Oklahoma. While both crude oil contracts that trade respectively on the Intercontinental Exchange and the New York Mercantile Exchange division of the CME they are pricing benchmarks for crude oils that are similar in the general regions.\\n The WTI-Brent spread is also a quality spread as WTI is lighter and sweeter than Brent meaning it has a lower sulfur content than the Brent variety. WTI is more suitable for processing into gasoline while Brent is the petroleum that most refineries use to make distillate products like heating oil, diesel, and jet fuels. Over the long-term, and before U.S. output increased dramatically, WTI typically traded at around a $2 premium over Brent because gasoline is the most ubiquitous oil product. Given the regions that price their oil output from the two benchmarks, the WTI-Brent spread also serves as a barometer of political risk since Brent is the price used by producers in the Middle East. Brent-WTI tends to decline with the price of oil, but not so far Since the price of crude oil is sensitive to events in the Middle East which is home to over half of the world's oil reserves, the spread often moves higher when the market perceives that the risk of supply disruptions from the Middle East rise. \\n\\n Source: CQG As the chart of the price of WTI minus Brent nearby crude oil futures highlights, the Brent premium over WTI rose to its all-time peak during the Arab Spring that swept political change across the Middle East and North Africa beginning in 2010. The Brent premium rose to a peak of $27.64 per barrel in October 2011. Over past years, the Brent premium has typically moved higher during bull market periods in the oil market and lower during bearish periods. In February 2016, when the price of nearby NYMEX futures fell to lows at $26.05, the Brent premium traded between 43 cents and $2.84 per barrel. In 2018, the range in the Brent premium has been from $2.87 in March when NYMEX futures traded in a range from $59.95 to $66.55 per barrel to a high at $11.55 per barrel in June when the range on the nearby NYMEX contract was from $63.59 to $74.46 per barrel.\\n Since October 3, the price of crude oil declined from $76.90 to $42.36, but the Brent WTI spread only fell from $10.56 to $7.31 on the nearby futures contract. The price of February NYMEX future crude oil futures was trading at the $45.00 level on December 26, and the Brent premium on February futures stood at the $7.85 level, almost $5 higher than it was on the lows of the year in March when the price of crude oil was over $18 higher. The divergence from typical price action could be a sign of strength and a potential bottom for the oil market, and it is the result of at least three factors. Reason one: U.S. versus OPEC output At their December meeting in Vienna, OPEC with the assistance of the Russian cut production by 1.2 million barrels per day. The cartel could not come to a consensus on production policy in the face of the falling price of the energy commodity, so they turned to Russia, a non-OPEC member, for help. Russia's role in OPEC had increased since 2016 when they acted as a mediator to negotiate and participate in a production cut that led to a rebound in the price of the energy commodity. The Russians earned lots of goodwill since that time, and at the most recent meeting the Saudis, under pressure from U.S. President Donald Trump, only supported a reduction of one million barrels while other cartel members favored a 1.4 million barrel cut. OPEC did not come to a decision on the day of the meeting, but after consultation with the Russian oil minister Alexander Novak and approval from Vladimir Putin the Russians suggested a compromise at 1.2 million barrels and offered to participate in the cut. The Russian deal called for OPEC members to decrease their output by 800,000 barrels with exemptions for Iran, Libya, and Venezuela. In exchange, the Russians and other countries close to the Putin regime would contribute 400,000 barrels to the deal for a total of 1.2 million. The deal was another sign of Russian influence within the cartel and boosted the price of Brent when compared to WTI.\\n At the same time, U.S. production of crude oil has been climbing from the oil-rich shale regions because of a combination of technological advances in fracking that have lowered production costs, and fewer regulations under the Trump Administration. According to the Energy Information Administration, U.S. production has reached 11.7 million barrels per day making America the leading producer in the world surpassing the output from Saudi Arabia and Russia. As I have written in previous articles, the rise of the U.S. as a dominant producer has made OPEC a toothless cartel and these days; oil production policy is a combination of decisions made in Washington DC, Moscow, and Riyadh, Saudi Arabia with the Saudis the least influential in the process. President Trump had been leaning on the Saudis to increase production while the price of oil was climbing towards its early October peak for fear of a price spike because of sanctions on Iran. The international pressure on the Saudis following the murder of Jamal Khashoggi in Turkey likely led to Saudi capitulation to the demands of the U.S. leader and their lobbying for the smallest output cut at the latest OPEC meeting. A production cut from OPEC and record production from the U.S. has caused the Brent premium to remain at high levels despite the fall in the price of crude oil. Reason two: Political risk Another reason for the high level of the Brent premium is that the sanctions on Iran only began at the start of November and are just now beginning to bite at the Iranian economy. Compared to the U.S., Russia, and KSA, Iran is a small producer with only 4.7 million barrels per day of output and 2.7 million barrels of exports. To keep the price of oil under pressure, the U.S. granted exemptions to eight countries that purchase Iranian crude oil in November which added to selling in the crude oil futures market. While the U.S. is putting economic pressure on the theocracy in Iran, part of the strategy has been to keep the price of oil in check and prevent any price hikes. With the sanctions on the horizon in September, many market participants bought crude oil expecting it to move higher and perhaps to over $100 per barrel when the sanctions took effect. However, the exemptions caused disappointed longs to exit their risk positions, and the increased selling from the Saudis under U.S. pressure caused the price of crude oil to collapse.\\n Meanwhile, the selling in crude oil that took the price to the $45 per barrel level comes at a time when the U.S. continues to turn the economic screws on the Iranians which could lead to retaliatory acts in the region. The leaders of Iran told the market if the U.S. prevents them from exporting the energy commodity, they will make sure that no other producing countries in the Persian Gulf will export their oil. The threat likely gave rise to the exemptions as the lower oil price has caused additional economic pressure on the theocracy. However, the risk of retaliation is a present danger in the Middle East over the sanction issue. Moreover, the ongoing proxy war between Iran and Saudi Arabia and the blockade of Qatar, who resigned from OPEC recently, are other reasons for the higher price of Brent versus WTI crude oil. Any hostilities in the Middle East that impact production, refining, or logistical routes for crude oil can still cause the price of the energy commodity to spike which is why a risk premium for Brent remains appropriate in the current environment. Reason three: A move higher on a percentage basis is counter-intuitive The price of crude oil plunged, which means that if historical trends repeat, the Brent premium over WTI should have declined. However, it has increased dramatically as a percentage of the prices of both Brent and WTI since October 3. On that day, the price of NYMEX futures traded to a high at $76.90 per barrel and the high for Brent was at $86.72 per barrel. The high for the Brent WTI premium during the week of October 1 was at $10.56 which was 13.7% of the WTI price and 12.2% of the Brent price on the highs. On Wednesday, December 26 the prices of WTI and Brent February futures were $45 and $53.85 respectively with the premium for Brent at $7.85 basis the settlement prices. The premium stood at 17.4% above the WTI price and 14.6% above the Brent price. The premium has increased as a function of both prices in a bear market where it typically declines on both a nominal and percentage basis.\\n There are many reasons for the bid in the Brent-WTI spread these days, and it is still possible we will see a lagged effect, and it will fall. However, the longer it stays around the current level, the more it is likely to soften the blow when it comes to further selling in the oil futures market. The end of the year can be a time where prices extend to irrational levels because of tax or window dressing reasons in the crude oil market. At the same time, the winter tends to be a seasonally weak time for the crude oil market, and it is likely that we will find a bottom sometime in Q1. With the current low level of crude oil and selling in the stock market, shares of many oil companies and ETF products are at the lowest prices in years. The Energy Select Sector SPDR ETF (XLE) is a highly liquid product that tends to move higher or lower with the price of crude oil. The product contains some of the best names in the oil business and has net assets of $15.45 billion and trades an average of over 20 million shares each day. The expense ratio at 0.13% is low. The fund summary for the XLE states: The investment seeks to provide investment results that, before expenses, correspond generally to the price and yield performance of publicly traded equity securities of companies in the Energy Select Sector Index. In seeking to track the performance of the index, the fund employs a replication strategy. It generally invests substantially all, but at least 95%, of its total assets in the securities comprising the index. The index includes securities of companies from the following industries: oil, gas and consumable fuels; and energy equipment and services. The fund is non-diversified. XLE's top holdings include: \\n\\n\\n Source: Yahoo Finance The price of NYMEX WTI crude oil dropped from $76.90 on October 3 to $45.00 on December 26, a drop of 41.5%. \\n\\n Source: CQG Over the same period, the XLE fell from a high at $78.36 on October 9 to $55.35 per share on Wednesday, a decline of 29.4%. The XLE is trading at the lowest level since February 2016 when crude oil reached its low at $26.05. Technical support is at the January 2016 low at $49.93. XLE currently pays a 2.96% dividend. If the Brent-WTI premium is telling us that crude oil is going to find a bottom over the coming weeks or during the first quarter of 2019, this could be an excellent time to put the XLE on your radar and begin buying the ETF on a scale-down basis leaving plenty of room to add if the price continues to decline. There is a sale going on in the oil patch these days, and the Brent premium could be a sign that the price implosion over recent months will find a bottom in the volatile energy commodity.\\nThe Hecht Commodity Report is the most comprehensive commodities reports available today from the top-ranked ranked author in both commodities, forex, and precious metals.

Sorry to disappoint all of you in advance. There\\'s been a lot of angst and finger pointing in recent weeks about the downturn in the stock market. The easiest target, and the most vocal, has been Donald Trump. I think I\\'ve been pretty balanced with Trump over time. I said he wasn\\'t responsible for the 2017 stock bull market, and while I\\'ve poked some fun at him here and on Twitter and derided him over the years for talking about the stock market, I really don\\'t think we can blame him for this downturn. You might be wondering why I think this. Well, this all started long before most Americans think it did. Yes, this downturn started way back in January, when global stocks peaked. Have a look for yourself. \\n\\n You see, the deceptive part about this downturn was, in the USA, the S&P 500 kept ticking higher over the summer of 2018, while global stocks had peaked and mostly continued to flatline or move lower. But the correlation here was still 90%+. In other words, global stocks started turning south long before Donald Trump went on a series of Twitter tirades. And that\\'s the problem with the \"Trump made the stock market crash\" narrative - if he made US stocks crash then he must have also made the entire global stock market crash. Does anyone really believe the President of the USA is the main influencing factor in global stocks? Now, I am not saying that he didn\\'t influence it at all. I certainly think his trade deals have been silly and most of his chatter about the stock market should be halted by his advisors. But at the end of the day, the stock market is a great big place made up of tens of thousands of entities. The President of the USA might influence these entities to some degree, but he isn\\'t causing them to operate the way they do, and in the long run, that\\'s what really matters here.\\n I think we have to be careful injecting politics into our investment discussions. Deriving an investment position from a political position is, in my opinion, the easiest way to ruin a portfolio and inject behavioral biases into your portfolio. NB - You might be wondering why I think the stock market did turn down. Honestly, I don’t know, but as I said at the beginning of last year, the high returns of recent years were unsustainable and likely to moderate in the coming years. The era of high and safe returns is over. So, why did stocks fall? Because in order for them to rise in the long term, sometimes they need to fall in the short term. That’s just how this works, and our political narratives rarely have much to do with how that all happens.\\n']}\n",

We\\'re using the end of the year as a chance to lift our heads, survey the market, and see what might be coming ahead. To do so, we\\'re inviting our Marketplace authors to do a series of roundtables. 2018 was another steady growth year for the platform, and we have a lot of great voices on the Marketplace, so we wanted to share their perspective with you. Our Year End Marketplace Roundtable series will run through the first full market week in January. We\\'ll feature ten different roundtable discussions, with expert panels chiming in on Tech, Energy, Dividends, Other Income strategies, Gold, Value Investing, Small-Caps, Alternative investing strategies, Biotech, and the Macro outlook. This roundtable looks at tech, which led the market higher and is doing so again lower, with the Nasdaq hitting a bear market in the last full week of the year. What\\'s going on? We asked our panel to make sense of the situation:   Hans Hauge, author of Crypto Blue Chips   Tom Lloyd, author of Daily Index Beaters   Elazar Advisors, LLC, author of Nail Tech Earnings   Damon Verial, author of Exposing Earnings   Michael Wiggins De Oliveira, author of Deep Value Returns   The Freedonia Cooperative, author of Coin Agora   Joe Albano, author of Tech Cache   App Economy Insights, author of App Economy Portfolio   B&B Market, author of Corporate China   David Pinsen, author of Bulletproof Investing   Matt Bohlsen, author of Trend Investing   Billy Duberstein, author of Fat Pitch Expedition   Mark Hibben, author of Rethink Technology   Juan Carlos Zuleta, author of Lithium Investing   Jeffrey Himelson, author of Invest With A Stacked Deck   Arun Chopra CMT, CFA, author of Fusion Trading  \\n Seeking Alpha: It feels like the Nasdaq had a bad year given the recent months, but as of December 11th the index is still in the green. How would you summarize 2018 for Tech? (Note: Question obviously asked on December 11th - prices have changed!) Tom Lloyd: Deviation from the mean describes almost perfectly what is happening to the Tech Stocks. Just take a look at the monthly charts for Apple (AAPL) and Netflix (NFLX) and you can see how irrationally the market, the ETFs and the robot trading had moved price to unsustainable highs. The efficient market eventually kicks in and price returns to the mean. I am looking for bargains where the pullback is overdone and in 3 to 5 years the stocks will double. I am just waiting for the bottoms to be confirmed so I can put them back in my model portfolio once again. Elazar Advisors, LLC: Tech was doing great in 2017 and the first half of 2018 but hit a brick wall in the third quarter. We told subscribers to be hedged through just about all of October, November and December because we saw that earnings growth was peaking. Earnings drive stock prices. Q3 ended up being even worse than we expected. Q4 should be no different. Be careful. Damon Verial: In the short term, it certainly does feel like the NASDAQ hasn’t been doing well. But as stated, tech stocks are actually up as a whole. The fear right now is a product of the recency illusion: That this time is different. In fact, every bull market has corrections, and these corrections are healthy for their ability to prevent real bubbles, such as that of 2000. As the economic environment is still one of growth, I am confident that this current pullback is a mere correction and not a repeat of 2000. Michael Wiggins De Oliveira: It has been a year of two halves. In the first half of 2018, tech stocks were fashionably in favor. It became a brainless transaction for many market participants. But towards the back end of 2018, there has been a slightly more subdued market. Now, here is the thing, while many investors are panicking, and while the market has been swift in its sell-off, it has not been, overall, all that bad. There are still plenty of names, such as Amazon (AMZN) and Netflix, which still carry egregious valuations. Yes, there are some pockets which have been grounded slightly, like Nvidia (NVDA), but even then, these slightly cheaper opportunities are not yet trading in the bargain basement. Overall, the market is still very expensive – contrary to most investors’ opinion.\\n The Freedonia Cooperative: Regardless of green or red, 2018 is going to go down as a defining year for tech in terms of privacy and security. Facebook (FB) bore the brunt of it this year and I think they\\'ll continue to do so; but Google (GOOG) and Apple may find themselves under fire with recent reports on apps tracking locations. Tech is still seen as a major good in American life, but tides are changing where the size, scope, and microeconomics that these companies support are going to come into questions of fear from users. Companies are going to have to both invest in privacy in 2019 and assure users of it; bringing spikes in investments here and/or changes in business strategy that relies heavily on targeted advertisement. Joe Albano: Tech has seen a myriad of factors play into its ups and downs with much of it balancing out to a neutral sentiment albeit barely green year overall. Social media stocks such as Facebook, Google, and Twitter (TWTR) are feeling the effects of incidents and allegations brought to light throughout the year leaving them in a flat-to-down return for the year. On the other hand, software has seen a pretty stable year as tariffs on physical items haven\\'t affected these companies nearly as directly - companies like CyberArk (CYBR), FireEye (FEYE), and Microsoft (MSFT). Hardware has seen the best of times and the worst of times this year. Many 52-week highs were made just a few months ago including Nvidia and Apple, both of which dealing with retail-sided pressure. Tech performance overall has fragmented forcing investors to find where the pockets of strength are. It\\'s not as easy as filling the shopping cart with everything from aisle 4, and so this is where the advantage of knowing the industry to know what will perform well comes into play. App Economy Insights:  I don’t look at the market on a calendar year basis and would rather focus on where we are in the credit cycle. While 2018 might look almost flat, there is a much bigger story here. On December 20th, for the first time since 2008, the NASDAQ entered bear market territory, falling more than 20% from its record reached at the end of August. This bear market was much needed after a 10-year bull run. I welcome it as a great time for opportunities to put new money to work. Investors who maintain a diversified portfolio and stay invested so they experience the subsequent recovery should not be harmed. Remaining focused on the long term is an important thing to do when in the middle of a bear market.\\n B&B Market: The majority of 2018 has been a strong year for technology companies, however hectic is a great word to summarize the year. The NASDAQ had returned 15% as of the beginning of October but has lost 17% in the last 2 months, making the YTD return about -5% as of this writing. This year, the markets were plagued by privacy scandals, government attacks, and a trade war as some notable events. The markets became extremely volatile near the end of the year and I foresee the beginning of 2019 to act similarly. Matt Bohlsen: 2018 for tech has been a tale of two halves - H1 2018 was good, and H2 2018 has been bad. In particular, late 2018 has seen risk-off sentiment due to the US-China trade war and rising US rates. Fundamentals have not really changed, except for greater regulator scrutiny on the way tech companies use customers\\' data and some slowdown in the tech giants\\' growth rates which was to be expected. Billy Duberstein: Well... it ain\\'t green anymore as of 12/20 as I write this! I think the word I\\'d use to describe 2018 is \"Whipsaw.\" Tech is a mixture of high-growth, high-multiple software companies and cyclical chip/hardware stocks. In the wake of the 2017 tax cuts, U.S. growth accelerated, leading to blowout results and fueling optimism. Then, Trump started the trade war with China in the Spring, which has, at least rhetorically, escalated since that time. In addition, the October Bloomberg Businessweek article about Chinese hacking of Super Micro Computer motherboards called into question the security of much of the tech supply chain. Then, just as soon as we get a trade \"truce\" in early December, the Canadians arrest the CFO of Huawei for violating Iran sanctions. These tensions fueled fears that a wrench would be thrown into global trade generally and the tech supply chain specifically. Add in the Fed going somewhat on autopilot with rate hikes, and all of that growth optimism has reversed (killing cyclicals) while investors began to use higher discount rate assumptions (killing high P/E growth stocks at the same time). So, there was a huge whipsaw in sentiment from extremely positive in 1H to extremely negative in the matter of a few months. \"Whipsaw!\" Quite a change from the low-volatility environment we were in last year.\\n Mark Hibben: It was a good year up until the beginning of October. Then a number of factors converged that caused the market to sell off many tech companies. There was weak earnings guidance from companies such as Apple and Nvidia. There was fear that the trade war would hurt, both directly and indirectly, companies that do business in China or which have production in China. Bloomberg\\'s The Big Hack, which alleged that the Chinese had infiltrated the data centers of companies like Amazon through modified server hardware, seemed to heighten the paranoia concerning China. And there were numerous analyst warnings about a \"chip slowdown\" which the media applied indiscriminately to all semiconductor companies. The combined effect has been to drive many companies negative on the year. However, many of these companies represent buying opportunities, and I plan on making purchases in 2019. SA: The air came out of FAANG a little in the second half of the year especially, though again only Facebook is down on a total return basis. Has the story changed for these market leaders? Tom Lloyd: No, the story has not changed and the only thing that has changed is price and how cheap you can buy them. I keep thinking about how Warren Buffett was smart enough to buy Apple at the very bottom. Now we will have that opportunity with all of the FAANG stocks. I don’t see one loser, but obviously some stocks are going to stay bottoming longer than others. Elazar Advisors, LLC: They seemed to all slow in Q3 for different reasons. I think it\\'s safe to stay away as long as their growth rates continue to contract. High multiple stocks with contracting growth rates is not a pretty formula. Usually it takes at least 4 quarters for a company to work out of a slowing trend. But you can\\'t just buy in four quarters. You\\'d first need some inkling that something\\'s improving. Damon Verial: FAANG is a coin termed by Jim Cramer, who has been shown statistically to be wrong more often than right. As an analyst with mainstream appeal, Jim Cramer gains more from speaking about popular stocks than stocks that are likely to outperform. I don’t choose my plays by the popularity of the stock but by the probability that the stock will move in a certain direction.\\n Michael Wiggins De Oliveira: FAANGs make for a catchy name. However, that’s all it is, nothing more than a journalistic sounding name. Because, for instance, even within the FAANGs themselves, there are huge valuation discrepancies. For example, no rational and experienced investor should make the argument that Apple and Amazon should be similarly valued. Yet currently we find them trading with similar market caps. More specifically, we know that Amazon’s Q4 2018 results are guided to post revenue growth of between 10%-20%. While presently, investors are pricing in substantially higher growth. On the other hand, Apple is growing its top line around 15%, yet investors are not willing to pay more than 15 times earnings. And remember, Apple has a rock solid balance sheet and an accelerated share repurchase program which has more than $50 billion allocated for repurchases over the near to medium-term. Amazon, on the other hand, carries a weak balance sheet with debt and capital leases and yet investors are willing to pay more than 90 times its earnings. In summary, the story has not changed as much as investors believe. Amazon was in favor at the start of 2018 and it still is. Apple, Facebook and Alphabet were cheap earlier in the year and they still are. The only question mark could be around Netflix. While it appears that its bubble may have started to deflate, it’s too soon to call it one way or another. For now, Netflix is still very much in favor with investors. The Freedonia Cooperative: Facebook is the first to feel the burn of this, but I think others will soon. Social Media is so reliant on data-based microtargeting because it has few other inherent value propositions in terms of revenue; but Google may have some of this coming, as well as Amazon, who took the lead in 2018 in product search. Joe Albano: All for one and one for all is the best way to sum it up. Facebook\\'s issues aren\\'t affecting Netflix, but Netflix is down almost 40% from its July highs while its business looks pretty decent on a subscriber momentum basis. Amazon has had its political struggles, down 25% since its highs. Each has had their unique struggles but being the largest companies traded, it\\'s easy to deflate these stock prices first especially as high valuation leaders (exceptions of course). They all have their own problems, but they all seem to affect each other - the answer is they each represent a leading and relevant facet of our society. Therefore, one weakened pillar supposes the idea the other pillars are not far behind.\\n App Economy Insights: To a certain extent, the air that came out of FAANG is mean reversion working its magic. Investors should not reasonably expect a +20% year time and time again. Google, Apple, Amazon have built platforms and ecosystems that developers, publishers and consumers will probably rely on for the decades to come. Government regulation has been the theme in 2018 for social media giants like Google and Facebook. More of these growing pains should be expected in the coming years. These are necessary steps in their outstanding growth stories. It might create a lower ceiling than expected on their overall potential, but it will create an even stronger moat around their leading positions.   David Pinsen: I think the business story is still the tension between their moats as oligopolies and the threat (however small in the near term) of antitrust or other regulatory action against them. Amazon increasing its minimum wage in the U.S. to $15 per hour (nearly double the current federal minimum wage) can be seen as an attempt to ward this off. Matt Bohlsen: Facebook has seen user growth slow down or stall especially in developed markets such as the US and Europe; however, developing markets such as Asia are still growing well. Amazon has seen their revenue growth rate slow. Apple is seeing a slowdown in global smartphone sales. Netflix sales growth is still strong and doing well from a smaller base than those mentioned above. Alphabet growth has slowed. What this all tells us is that the % growth of the very large FAANG stocks has slowed, with the smaller Netflix as the exception. It is like China GDP - the growth rate % can slow, but due to the massive size, the raw number growth is still impressive. Investors will need to expect a bit lower (but still positive) rates of return on big tech going forward. Valuations have been adjusting in H2 2018, and are now closer to fair value, and worth starting to accumulate again. Billy Duberstein: Stories are always changing with FAANG, which is why these huge companies are so interesting, but the most significant story change is indeed Facebook. The degree to which the story has changed is unclear, but there are now some legitimate questions around the business model. Facebook is still very profitable and growing, but there is a big concern around how much it will have to spend to police its platform and if the margins of the company are now structurally lower, or if the margin contraction next year will be a one-off. There is also some concern around data privacy. I\\'m not sure if the company\\'s ads will be quite as effective if users withhold meaningful data from the company (I suspect they will still be pretty effective though). But I don\\'t think there will be much defection from the platforms. Thank God the company also bought Instagram, which most users probably don\\'t even know is owned by the same company. Instagram really seems to be doing well and beating Snapchat at its own game. There\\'s also some personality drama around Zuckerberg and Sandberg, but I don\\'t think the average user or advertiser cares that much about that stuff. I lean towards Facebook turning out okay in the long run, but my confidence in Facebook is admittedly now the lowest of the FAANGs. Since the others have now all sold off as well this month (Facebook fell first), I\\'d prefer the other FAANGs to Facebook, though I didn\\'t necessarily think that some months ago when the others were relatively more expensive. That being said, these companies all remain incredible businesses and I think all are probably good long-term buys after the recent swoon, Facebook being the riskiest.\\n Mark Hibben: FAANG is kind of a convenience category and these companies don\\'t always have a much in common. I\\'ve never been a fan of the ad supported social media companies such as Facebook and Google. I consider Netflix still overvalued, although it\\'s not as bad as it was. Apple and Amazon I consider to be interesting \"new paradigm\" semiconductor companies. New paradigm companies design their own processors rather than buy from commodity vendors such as Intel. Apple has been doing this for years for its iOS devices, and Amazon recently joined the ranks of the new paradigm when it announced that it was deploying custom designed ARM processors in its data centers. Although the recent downturn has certainly affected their valuations, I don\\'t think it\\'s changed my fundamental takes on these companies. The social media companies are mainly about merchandising personal information. This is becoming more of an issue, and I don\\'t think it\\'s an issue that can be solved without fairly dramatic change to their business models. I avoid social media companies, but consider the new paradigm to be the wave of the future in semiconductors. Juan Carlos Zuleta: I beg to differ - I am instead of the opinion that the second half of the year and in particular the last three months of 2018 was bad for FAANG because all of reasons that triggered the fall of their stocks occurred beginning July. Here I am talking about Facebook\\'s scandal over data privacy; Amazon\\'s Q3 earnings report; Apple\\'s legal battle with Qualcomm (QCOM); Netflix\\'s drop in subscriber growth due to competition; and Google\\'s European fine over security flaws. SA: Speaking of Facebook, what do you see for the company in 2019 and beyond? Hans Hauge: Facebook has become a tech dinosaur. I think what we\\'re seeing now is their slow decline. Just talk to any kid on the street and ask them what they think of Facebook. They\\'ll tell you it\\'s just not cool anymore. Besides that, people who are interested in privacy jumped ship long ago, and the rest of the population is only hanging around because, well there\\'s nowhere better to go yet. Does that mean Facebook is a bad investment? I\\'m not saying that, they could continue to make money, good money even; despite being long in the tooth.\\n Tom Lloyd: Facebook is probably dead money for 2019, but once it moves off the bottom, I think it will zoom back to making new highs. Unfortunately, it has enormous challenges, but I think Zuckerberg has shown he knows how to handle challenges. Facebook is in dry dock for repairs to its leaky boat, but be ready for the launch and a less leaky boat making the trip around the world and taking Facebook back to new highs and beyond. Facebook becomes even more important in a recession as users spend more time on it. Ad budgets will be cut during a recession, but Facebook may take more market share, rather than less. I think they will beat Google. Elazar Advisors, LLC: I think this is getting worse. The company guided now two quarters in a row specifically citing a slowdown in revenue growth. Based on what Mark Zuckerberg has said publicly that 2019 will be a tough year I think this trend can continue to worsen. Facebook has a problem. They are trying to muscle their core customer\\'s usage habits from passive consumption back to social engagement. Typically they\\'ve done a good job chasing consumer habits. Now they are trying to change them? This is not a safe stock. We are below the Street for earnings. Damon Verial: Facebook is safe. The company has a monopoly on social media advertising and arguably the best customer metrics in the industry. As a former digital marketer, I’ve used practically every digital advertisement vendor on the internet, and Facebook stands out as the best in terms of specific targeting. While Google advertisements get you more exposure, Facebook offers marketers the ability to target virtually any specific group intersection (e.g., newly wed women in their 20s who are interested in cosmetics). Some analysts consider Google and Facebook competitors, but the truth is both of these companies are monopolies in their given niche and can operate alongside each other, provided Google Plus never gets big or Facebook never creates a search engine. As the marketing becomes increasingly digital, stealing revenue from television, radio, and the like, both Facebook and Google should continue to grow their revenue and earnings.\\n Michael Wiggins De Oliveira: Facebook is my best idea among the tech stocks. There is no scenario where the stock is not undervalued. Pick any metric. Most investors could not seriously expect Facebook to continue to grow in the medium term at plus 40% year-over-year as it has been. Those days are gone. But what’s left? Well, it\\'s my strong contention that Facebook can grow above 20% year-over-year over the next 2-3 years. Having said that, most investors are fearful (understandably) of Facebook’s elevated operational expenses, which are going to hit between 40%-50% in 2019 - worse case assumption Facebook’s FY 2019 operating expenses will reach $47 billion. In other words, Facebook’s operating income will hover around $27 billion. Is that so bad? For a company priced at $420 billion market cap? This implies that Facebook is being priced at roughly 15 times operating income. And we should remember, that Facebook’s balance sheet carries around $40 billion of cash and equivalents (and no debt). Moreover, two further aspects need to be brought to the front of the thesis. Facebook is an extremely asset-light business, where 30% of its revenue ends up as free cash flow. In essence, Facebook is not a capital intensive business, where a large portion of its earnings need to be reinvested, no. Not at all. And finally, investors should recognise that Facebook has increased its allocation for share repurchases by $9 billion to $24 billion. If this is not a sign of management’s confidence in the business, I don’t know what is. The Freedonia Cooperative: It\\'ll rebound and have enough capital to reinvent itself (I believe they still have no debt on their books) — but it\\'ll need to find a way to repair its image with the young people who are active on mobile but also more conscious of what\\'s happening in the tech arena. Joe Albano: Facebook has been mired in PR report after PR report - none of which have been positive. The media is doing much the same they do in politics - if they don\\'t like you, it doesn\\'t matter what is happening, you\\'re wrong. Also much like the media, when they move onto their next target, the last target falls to the wayside. 2019 could be that transition to the next target while Facebook works toward its goal of moving toward Stories and Messenger (also WhatsApp) revenue. If both happen, then Facebook will be on the map again for stock price appreciation.\\n App Economy Insights: The story that has changed the most during 2018 has certainly been Facebook amid scandals of election meddling, private information usage, and management transparency. There will be consequences that will soon unravel: regulations will come with additional costs for the company to keep its platforms in check, some of the revenue growth could suffer from tougher rules around private information, and the hidden costs of a much-needed re-shuffle of the leadership team given the way they have handled PR. For 2019 and beyond, Facebook remains an outstanding business that is bigger than the sum of its parts. They are learning the hard way but will come out much stronger on the other side, with new rules and standards that will be very hard to replicate for any newcomer. Remember: even Google wasn’t able to build a sustainable social media platform. B&B Market: Facebook is a stock that has been abused this year. The company has been involved in multiple privacy scandals, on its main platform and on others such as WhatsApp. However, the stock is currently trading at very attractive multiples compared to historical norms. While I am not personally a user of Facebook, I see the data showing that it is a booming business. Users are reaching all-time highs, ad-revenue is strong, and the company is actively diversifying its business line into other segments such as VR and competitors like the Instagram acquisition. The market has beaten the stock down in 2018, I see this reversing in the future. Valuation wise, this is a strong opportunity to buy in my opinion. David Pinsen: Of the FAANGs, Facebook would be the most vulnerable to antitrust action, because its core platform has been in decline, and it has depended on acquisitions (e.g. Instagram, WhatsApp) to attract users. Whether there will be any antitrust action against it in 2019, I don\\'t know, but the company faces other challenges regardless, such as the lawsuits by video advertisers. Matt Bohlsen: Facebook platform overall user growth will slow, but monetisation across their various platforms should improve. Further data scrutiny and some fines can be expected. Overall, 2019 should see a solid but not spectacular year for Facebook with the stock price recovering to back above USD 150 and probably closer to USD 175, assuming no significant global slowdown and poor sentiment.\\n Billy Duberstein: 2019 should be flat earnings on higher spending. The big question is if the company can moderate spending and continue to raise ad prices in 2020 and beyond to rejuvenate operating leverage. It will be interesting to see how long the terrible headlines last for Facebook - there seems to be a new one each week and I don\\'t see that changing in the near-term unfortunately. How patient will investors be? Mark Hibben:  Facebook usage appears to be on the decline, according to a recent Pew survey. I\\'m not convinced that more extensive privacy settings will be enough to solve Facebook\\'s fundamental problems of fake news and foreign exploitation. This is a problem not unique to Facebook, of course, but is general in social media. Jeffrey Himelson:  I see regulatory measures disrupting its business model. SA: What\\'s the biggest story in tech this year as far as you are concerned? Tom Lloyd: Tesla (TSLA) seems to be Teflon coated for the time being. By all accounts they should have gone bankrupt, but the stock keeps climbing to that $420 target of Elon Musk, just to prove the regulators were wrong and Elon was right. It is too risky and too overvalued for our model portfolio. Computer assisted driving is taking over all cars and Tesla is at the cutting edge here and in the electric car. This is the Tech story that will affect everyone that drives a car in the next 5 years. Elazar Advisors, LLC: The trade war was just news until it hit earnings. Earnings are what drives stock prices and corporate CEOs all blinked slowing purchasing decisions in Q3 waiting for trade war resolution. Until that is resolved, I see tech continuing to slow. What bigger story is there? Damon Verial: On the topic of Facebook, note that the company gains its data essentially for free, from its users’ (not paying customers) devices. Facebook has come preinstalled on many phone brands for some time now, but a more recent development will allow the company to acquire even more detailed data. Before 2019, a new Android update (which will be automatic, without a permission prompt) will force users to allow the OS to continually update Facebook with your phone information, including SMS and call logs. Of course, Google has a hand in this because Android is its OS. The question is whether Google will be collecting data for their own use as well.\\n The Freedonia Cooperative: Facebook and Cambridge Analytics and the fallout from that being seen elsewhere. Joe Albano: The global economic story - it\\'s affecting everything including tech. But let\\'s not forget the front half of this year was quite good. There\\'s a lot of uncertainty in the back half of this year and it\\'s causing quick decisions by management in all companies to change investment directions and move to safer places. \\'Growth\\' and \\'safe\\' generally don\\'t go together. Growth requires investment and return on investment and that is being stagnated right now with the state of global affairs. The hope is this doesn\\'t trigger other events and economic faults to appear or the dominoes to fall but the preparation at the end of this year is to ready for it if it does. App Economy Insights:  Coming from the video game industry, the biggest story of 2018 for me has been Fortnite from Epic Games (40% owned by Tencent (OTCPK:TCEHY)). Following the success of Fortnite (more than 200 million registered users and $2 billion revenue in 2018), a new expectation of the way we play video games has emerged: cross-platform play, seamlessly syncing people playing on smartphones, PCs and consoles. Not only did Epic Games reveal a new store that will compete with STEAM and Google by disrupting the pricing model on PC and Android (challenging the status quo with a 12% distributor margin), they also announced they will launch free services designed to help developers implement cross-platform play into their games. This is more important than you might think: this paves the way for competitive games to become platform-agnostic and could make existing console hardware mostly irrelevant. B&B Market: Funny enough, the biggest story had to have been the Chinese IP scandal that was just reported in mid-December. Reportedly, the Chinese government has been employing hackers to steal IP from American companies, codenamed \"Operation Cloudhopper\". This story encapsulates all the negative themes that we have seen in the tech markets throughout this year. There is malpractice from China, a break of privacy and law, and there is IP theft which has been a main driver of the US-China tensions. IBM and HP are among the affected and these reports will most likely be a direct impact on the outcome of the recent 90-day cease fire between the 2 nations. It is sure to be interesting to see how the current administration handles this report.\\n David Pinsen: Probably the precipitous declines in the esteems of Facebook\\'s CEO and COO. Sheryl Sandberg was mooted as Hillary Clinton\\'s likely Treasury Secretary had Mrs. Clinton won the election in 2016, and Mark Zuckerberg appeared to be testing the waters for a presidential run of his own before this year\\'s Facebook scandals. Matt Bohlsen: The November launch by Alphabet of autonomous vehicles with no human driver in Phoenix, Arizona. The era of the robo-taxi has arrived. This can be a multi-billion dollar industry, and Alphabet\\'s Waymo is leading the way. It should also help boost electric vehicle sales as EV robo-taxi fleets are purchased. I expect it won\\'t be all smooth sailing, but disruptive change is never that way. Billy Duberstein: I think the China trade war and concerns of hacking/cybersecurity, because so much of the global tech supply chain moves through China, and the issue has really escalated to the forefront of both the business and geopolitical news. How the trade talks play out will be really consequential for tech and could lead to a binary outcome for the Nasdaq next year. Will China and the U.S. find ways to collaborate and prosper together, or will each nation re-trench and engage in an adversarial tech arms race? I would think cooler heads would prevail and that each side would act in its best interest. However, nothing\\'s off the table for this administration or for China, for that matter, which has not been a good actor. On the positive/cool innovation front, you will begin to see the first 5G phones and deployments next year - though it will still be really early days for that. And, of course, the continuing trends of cloud computing/AI/IoT and more automation in every aspect of life both for consumers and enterprises, which is the most important story of this decade and era. Mark Hibben: I actually thought the AWS announcement of the custom ARM chip deployment was the most significant news of 2018. I\\'ve been expecting ARM penetration of the datacenter market for some time, but it came from an unexpected source. The hyperscale datacenter providers such as Google, Microsoft, AWS, all have the resources to design their own chips, and I expect more will do so. The handwriting is on the wall for commodity chip makers such as Intel (INTC) and AMD (AMD).\\n Juan Carlos Zuleta: Apart from Facebook\\'s shares fall over data privacy since July, the biggest story in tech this year was the lawsuit battle between Apple and Qualcomm that brought about a victory for Qualcomm after courts in China and Germany ordered to ban imports, sales and offers for sale of various Apple iPhone models in China. Jeffrey Himelson: Privacy concerns. SA: Semiconductors genuinely had a tough year - are we in the middle of a downturn, or is something else going on? How important is this for tech investors to follow? Hans Hauge: The story behind semiconductors is simple, people underestimated the impact of crypto. The cryptocurrency market moves in waves, and from what we\\'ve seen the last few years, the waves are getting larger over time. Near the end of 2017, Bitcoin mining machines and graphics cards were selling on the secondary markets for multiples of their retail price. As the market crashed, all those cards flooded the market, and we saw the classic bullwhip effect. Suddenly there\\'s inventory piling up, and it will take some time for this to rectify itself. Semiconductors are a great long term play, and if you can get in while the price is discounted, all the better. Tom Lloyd: This is just the usual cyclical downturn. It should be no surprise to anyone. Just recognize the truth and don’t ride the cycle to the bottom. Micron has to prove this cycle is different. Otherwise investors need to wait for the bottom and the next upcycle. Elazar Advisors, LLC: Semis especially go in cycles. Q3 was a clear drop making Q2 the peak. That would mean that year-over-year growth probably continues down through Q2\\'19 at least. The problem is this upcycle was a little longer than the typical two years so the risk is the downcycle takes a little longer to work out. This is also not yet a safe group and certainly not before the trade war is resolved. We\\'ve been cautious on semis for a few quarters. Damon Verial: Semiconductor stock strength is contingent on tech stock strength, which itself is contingent on the general economy. I believe semiconductors will bounce back shortly.\\n Joe Albano: It\\'s not a downturn like the market thinks of semi downturns. The last downturn was because end demand for an entire category basically came to a halt (PC DRAM) while supply was still ramping. This time it\\'s not a matter of end demand weakening materially and not a matter of drunken supply. Instead, it\\'s an inter-vendor demand issue. After a huge rise in demand, now a few levers have fallen off (crypto mining for one), and there\\'s excess inventory at the OEM level. That inventory is being worked through to the end user, but it softens demand back to the manufacturer. Until this inventory is worked through, there isn\\'t a need for more bits being shipped. However, once inventory is cleared out, the end demand that was still there - \"hidden\" from the manufacturers - will cause a need to put product in the channel. At that point, after a year of capex cuts (controlled supply), there will be an imbalance the other way and demand will overtake supply. Look for this to happen in Q4 2019, if not slightly earlier. Matt Bohlsen: I think we are most likely to have a short term (1 year) lull as global smartphone sales have currently stalled. As we move past this and with the arrival of (and increase of) 5G, robots, autonomous vehicles, artificial intelligence, IoTs, cloud data storage expansion; that will lead to the next upcycle in semiconductors probably not felt until 2020. Many consumers are waiting to upgrade to 5G smartphones which we will start to see in 2019. This will increase further in 2020. 5G will be up to 100 x faster than 4G, and will soon have a huge impact. Billy Duberstein: Very important, and even experts disagree on this question. In my opinion, I think the current slowdown is a pause, or \"air pocket\" amid a powerful secular trend, and I\\'m sticking to my guns on this. That being said, if the Fed and/or administration makes a policy error on China or anything else and we get a global recession or depression, I\\'ll be wrong, or it will take longer to play out. I happen to think the semi trends are very powerful (\"smart everything\"), which are battling near-term cyclical concerns - and by the way, these are still just concerns. The economy is still growing. We unfortunately had crypto-mania and tax cuts, leading to a boom, and now trade war and Fed hikes have slammed the brakes. This is not ideal if you are a chip company that\\'s trying to match supply with demand on a near-term basis. I think the long-term picture is still pretty positive for most of these companies.\\n Mark Hibben: I think the market has gotten overly frightened about semis. The news media and the market don\\'t make the distinction between old paradigm, commoditized semiconductor companies such as Intel and Micron, and new paradigm semiconductor companies such as Apple, Nvidia, and Amazon. Memory and storage probably is headed into a cyclical decline, but that doesn\\'t mean that the new paradigm companies will follow. However, the market is acting like semis are a monolithic block. I believe that when the new paradigm companies report December quarter results, they\\'ll surprise to the upside. SA: What are you preparing for in 2019? What big themes matter? Tom Lloyd: We are preparing for slowing growth and lower earnings. The Fed, tariffs, gridlock in Congress, impeachment in the White House, combine for a disruptive and toxic brew for the stock market and the economy. We expect those who are Indexing will lose money in 2019 and 2020. So the Indexers need to become stock pickers again and make sure they are only in stocks that are beating the Index. Portfolio managers will rotate to lower beta stocks which will fall less than the market. The Dow stocks seem more attractive than the Nasdaq. We have a daily report on the Dow Index Stocks and only 11 have Sell Signals according to our computer system. I like the Healthcare, Technology and Communications Services ETFs for 2019. Elazar Advisors, LLC: I think 2019 is going to be super volatile, more than we see today. Everybody\\'s going to need to change how they think about stocks, trading and fundamentals. We\\'ve added a market overlay component to our service in the last few months and it helped our subscribers hedge out the last three months. Why take risk when the market is showing you it\\'s heading down. Volatile markets are bear markets. It looks like we\\'re early on in that. That said, I want to respect the market up or down but we cannot be complacent hoping stocks only go up. Fundamentals slowing in combination with downtrending volatile markets is something to respect and tread lightly.\\n Damon Verial: I believe that we will see the end of our current bull market and the beginning of a bear market in 2019. This is not tech-specific but will affect the entire market as a whole. The economic variables are peaking and growth is slowing. Once we see growth sloping down, which I predict we will see somewhere around the middle of 2019, the market should be around its peak and begin to fall. This will be a normal, “natural” bear market and is something all investors – tech investors included – should be preparing for as we enter 2019. The Freedonia Cooperative: Crypto (that\\'s my area of expertise here). 2018 was a tough year for it, with the storyline being something akin to the bubble burst. But what happens next? I\\'m hoping 2019, or perhaps 2020, will be where the real projects separate themselves and show the world what this innovative technology can do to industries. I think we\\'ll see heavily invested-in companies be able to do this first (Ripple, Stellar, Vechain), but the big elephant is going to Bitcoin at least through 2019. So depending on how the world economy adjusts to either let Bitcoin in or lock it out will have a huge effect on the crypto market at large. Joe Albano: Recovery. When does large growth return? That\\'s the question. App Economy Insights: As someone based in the San Francisco Bay Area who covers the App Economy, 2019 couldn’t look more exciting. It looks like it will be the year of the “decacorns” going public such as Uber, Airbnb, Lyft, possibly Pinterest among others. I look forward to following closely the trends that make the rise of the App Economy and the businesses resulting from it so fascinating, both from a consumer and an investor standpoint: the gig economy, experience economy, games as a service, online dating, transportation and more. B&B Market: Given that I focus on China and Chinese ADRs, 2018 had a lot of drama from the trade relations to currency weakness and more. As a result, we saw China stocks get crushed for the majority of the year and only just start to improve. For 2019, I am looking to capitalize on this. A lot of these companies have had revenues, earnings, margins, you name it, improve over the past few years but they are trading at very low multiples. The trade-war has been the focus and while I do not think it will disappear in 2019, I think most of the fear is already priced in.\\n Matt Bohlsen: My top 5 tech trends for 2019 are 5G, autonomous vehicles, artificial intelligence, Internet of Things [IoTs], and cloud data storage expansion. Many of these themes are just starting to grow now so will take about 3-5 years to really see the full impact. Billy Duberstein: I am leaning towards quality and balance sheet strength. Many high-quality companies have been sold off really hard, so it\\'s a great opportunity to upgrade the quality of your portfolios. Market leadership and a great balance sheet can help mitigate (or take advantage of) near-term volatility, especially in a rising rate environment. Fortunately, there are lots of leading tech companies that are currently in the best financial shape of their lives after the boom times of 2016-2017. Still, I think we will have a somewhat binary outcome in tech, revolving around US-China trade talks. If the U.S. and China make a deal that investors believe in, we could have a huge rally. If we don\\'t, we could languish here. Hard to think it could get worse, but then again, I didn\\'t think we\\'d be at these levels we\\'re at today. Mark Hibben: I\\'m mainly hoping that prices stay low for the tech companies I\\'m interested in so I can load up before prices go back up. For the time being, I\\'m content to wait until I see some signs of market stabilization, and because I can\\'t afford to buy any more at the moment. I am becoming concerned that the markets could induce a recession through a self-fulfilling prophesy, but right now, the indicators are just for a slowdown. The overall performance of the U.S. and other world economies in 2019 is going to weigh heavily on investors no matter what. Juan Carlos Zuleta: In 2019 I am preparing for more news on electrification of the global automotive industry with China consolidating its leadership and North America surpassing Europe in the second place, which is altogether likely to exert much more pressure over the energy lithium value chain. SA: What is one of your best ideas for 2019, and what is the story?\\n Hans Hauge: I think Bitcoin (BTC-USD) will be the best performing asset in 2019. Since 2010, we\\'ve seen the hash rate double 30 times, the number of transactions double 11 times, and the price double 16 times. Each time we see the price hit a new factor of ten (which has happened five times already), there\\'s a pull back and a \"crypto winter.\" During this crypto winter, the technology continues to be upgraded, improved - it evolves. Right now, the exact same thing is happening. Bitcoin\\'s average fee at this activity level was $10-$20 earlier this year, now it\\'s less than $0.40. A majority of the arguments against Bitcoin are based on two things (1) people don\\'t understand what it means, so they just can\\'t process what success would look like or (2) they don\\'t know what drives the value and they just aren\\'t educated on the topic. However, if you really dig in, you\\'ll see why some very smart people have dedicated their careers to the cryptoasset space. Blockchain technology is changing the world, and Bitcoin is the gold standard of the blockchain universe. Tom Lloyd: I expect the market to be down in 2019 and 2020. Therefore, I am very interested in stocks that are already beaten down to their bottoms, have very little downside risk and will bounce back. We will add Facebook, Apple, Nvidia and Netflix to our model portfolio as they bounce up from their bottoms. Micron is not one I am interested in bottom fishing. I think Amazon and Google will beat the Index, but I don’t think they will be in our model portfolio. We let our computer Buy/Hold/Sell Signals tell us on a daily basis. Elazar Advisors, LLC:  I have to tell you there are not so many good ideas out there right now. You have to respect slowing fundamentals. If you do, then you don\\'t want to own much of anything. There are a few great ones though and we\\'ve managed to catch big earnings performers in this market downdraft. Twitter is starting to see a big earnings inflection. There was that Citron call that Twitter\\'s going to get hit because of trolls harassing people but Twitter\\'s been on to that already. There was no new news in that call. Twitter\\'s priority throughout \\'18 was \"health\" removing bad actors. The recent report that Citron cited I think changes nothing in Twitter\\'s already proactive process. In the meantime, more importantly, we saw Twitter with a big Q3, and Q4 is seasonally stronger than Q3. They are making gradual changes to their network that are benefiting usage and advertiser ROI (Return On Investment). They might have an opening with Facebook and Google woes as well. Based on blow-out earnings potential, we see the stock can approach the high-50s which is like 100%+ upside potential.\\n Damon Verial: As previously stated, I believe 2019 will see both the peak of the bull market and the beginning of a bear market. Thus, my thesis for 2019 is not single-fold but two-fold. The market should represent an inverse parabola in this year, so my best idea for Q1-2 2019 will be bullish, while my best idea for Q3-4 2019 will be bearish. As Q3-4 is too early to call, I will simply answer that my best pick for this recent correction and the bounce back is Arista Networks (ANET), a fundamentally solid company still in a growth phase unfairly devalued by the recent selloff and one on which I have recently discussed in my newsletter. Michael Wiggins De Oliveira: Every single large tech company is laser focused on content: either scripted or unscripted. Netflix accomplished the unthinkable and very quickly. It has added 130 million subscribers to its platforms by focusing in on large quantities of scripted content. Furthermore, Netflix\\'s platform has carved out strong time share in consumers’ viewing time. It has indeed been so successful that well financed companies are now all trying to play this same game. Accordingly, 2019 will see Apple enter the foray as well as Disney+. Alphabet’s YouTube has also spoken about its plans to increase viewers\\' time on YouTube as an educational tool. Additionally, Facebook Watch has also shown determination to aggressively increase the amount of time its users spend watching and interacting with Watch’s content. Obviously, we also have Amazon Video playing this game too. However, a meaningfully less discussed company which I believe might succeed in surprising many investors in 2019 is Discovery (DISCK), of which I’m a shareholder. Discovery’s business model is different from that of Apple’s, Amazon Video or Netflix, in that Discovery’s content is unscripted and very inexpensive to produce. In fact, not only is Discovery’s business model is very cost-effective but Discovery has the IP on all of its content. For viewers of specific genre, be it sports, such as golf on the brand new Golf Tv platform, or Olympics through Eurosports, Discovery leads. Also, among women Discovery has a particularly strong market share. And while the self-propelled myth of cord-cutting appears to be engulfing Wall Street, this has left Discovery trading irrationally cheap. For FY 2019 Discovery is roughly guiding for $3 billion of free cash flow. Which means that currently, Discovery is trading for less than 7 times free cash flow. Compare that with Netflix, which will not have free cash flow for many years, and in the best case scenario, by my own estimates not likely to generate more than $2 billion of free cash flow once it tapers off its elevated content investment - leaving it trading at 50 times future free cash flow multiples. While at same time, its top line is already slowing down to below 30% year-over-year.\\n The Freedonia Cooperative: Anyone following my posts and/or is part of The Coin Agora knows I love Vechain, a logistics blockchain company out of China. Right now, its coin is super discounted (in my opinion) and gives investors a chance to lock up a significant amount of coins before its platform really gets started. In the coming year(s), Vechain will host DNV GL\\'s food shipping blockchain and BYD\\'s electronic car aspect of the carbon credit system—just to name two of many partnerships. It\\'s my favorite bet in crypto and it has nothing to do with disrupting the worldwide financial system—it\\'s just putting logistical data on a blockchain for better record keeping. Joe Albano: The best idea for 2019 is to have cash at the ready. We\\'re in a downtrend in tech and there\\'s no reason to rush in yet. That being said, I like Broadcom (AVGO). It\\'s a standout in the tech space - an outlook that is robust and bullish - while the rest of the sector is not on a firm foundation. Raising the dividend 51% was the \"put your money where your mouth is\" moment and management is putting forth all the right signals. I\\'m a buyer on technical support tests. App Economy Insights: In a market that is likely to be volatile and possibly with depressed valuation and the prospect of the r-word (recession), I am looking forward to strengthening positions in Enterprise Software. Indeed, Enterprise Software is likely to shine in a slowing economy – while consumer goods may suffer, enterprise software will remain relatively constant. Thus, there will be no shortage of demand for the best-in-class tools that empower the data science, finance, sales and marketing or engineering teams to achieve greatness. B&B Market:  I focus on Chinese ADRs, that is my specialty. The idea that has been on the forefront of my mind lately is Momo (MOMO). The stock reached all-time highs (near-$60) earlier in 2018, but is now back down into the low-$20s. Both top-line and bottom-line are growing at strong double-digit rates, MAUs are increasing every quarter, and the company has recently acquired Tantan, which is also growing in popularity. All of Momo and Tantan are internet platforms that are not impacted directly by tariffs from the trade tensions. However, because of a recent guidance cut (still growing at 40+%), institutional analysts have cut the PT from $60 down to $31. I may have missed the class that states short-term issues warrant a 50% reduction in valuation in the long-term. I am very bullish on this stock and believe that a majority of the Chinese ADRs are undervalued as a result of market overreaction from the trade war.\\n Matt Bohlsen: My best idea is to use the current tech and semiconductor downturn to start to accumulate positions at cheaper prices ready for the next upcycle. For example, I would be accumulating the following:  5G - Qualcomm Autonomous Vehicles - Alphabet (Waymo) Artificial Intelligence - Nvidia The Internet of Things - Skyworks Solutions Data Storage and the Cloud - Amazon  Others that have broad exposure to the above themes are also worth considering such as Samsung Electronics (OTC:SSNLF), Baidu (BIDU), Intel, and Microsoft. Cashed up giants Apple, Facebook, and Microsoft are also good tech names to accumulate at yearly lows. Billy Duberstein: I rode Micron all the way up in the first half of 2018 with terrific gains and then unfortunately rode it all the way back down. It currently trades just over tangible book and the company has $3 billion net cash. The stock just sold off on what *could* be a trough quarter guidance that missed expectations but really doesn\\'t look so bad relative to the current valuation of the company if it is the low point (or close to it) in the cycle. $2 billion net income and ~$1 billion FCF for the next quarter on a $35 billion market cap ain\\'t so bad, especially if it\\'s a trough. Last year the company made $14 billion and ~$10 billion in FCF. The DRAM oligopoly seems to be working to control supply (Micron just announced capex cuts) and the long-term demand outlook for memory should be strong and diverse, even if we are currently in a demand \"air pocket\" (fueled by the boom-bust phenomenon I discussed above). Micron is also structurally a much, much more profitable company than it was just three years ago relative to its Korean competitors, so it should be able to stay profitable in a downturn while also buying back a significant amount of stock at the same time, which it didn\\'t have the means to do in 2016. If the downturn turns out to be milder than feared, this historically low-multiple stock could re-rate higher coming out the other side. You may need to wait a couple quarters and have a strong stomach, but there\\'s multi-bagger potential here, barring a global recession or trade war escalation.\\n Mark Hibben: I think Nvidia is by far the most undervalued stock in my portfolio. It\\'s fundamentally a new paradigm semiconductor company being priced as if it were an old paradigm company with no future. Of all the tech companies in my portfolio, I consider Nvidia to have the greatest growth potential in relative terms. Nvidia is pioneering in many fields, including AI, autonomous machines and high performance computing. Nvidia\\'s Turing architecture GPUs are available for professionals and gamers, and provide real time photorealistic rendering that would have been considered impossible a year ago. Nvidia has no competition in this new category of graphics visualization (called ray-tracing), and has ensured continued leadership for many years due to its ray-tracing patents. I doubt that there\\'s market for three major GPU suppliers (Nvidia, AMD, and Intel), and I believe that AMD will be forced to spin off or sell its Radeon GPU business since it won\\'t be able to compete in ray-tracing. Intel is the most likely buyer. Juan Carlos Zuleta: Tesla is certainly my best bet for 2019 because despite all the problems it faced throughout the year, it demonstrated its shareholders its strength to preserve the value of the company. In this connection, we have to be vigilant as to how and when it proceeds to start assembling EVs in China and launching its long-awaited more affordable Model 3 in the U.S. and elsewhere. Jeffrey Himelson: I see Fitbit receiving FDA clearance, entering into numerous new partnerships and generating returning revenue streams, which will propel the stock in 2019. *** Thanks to our panel for sharing their insights on the fast moving tech sector.

The only certainty about global energy is that the markets will continue to surprise in 2019. The energy business has always been notorious for its ups and downs. This is even more true today, when the energy landscape is evolving rapidly. The old order is changing fast as new trade routes emerge, driven by the resurgence of US energy production. That said, there are a few key trends that emerged in 2018 that are likely to set the tone for the year ahead. U.S. Oil Independence The United States was a net exporter of oil and refined products for one week in late November for the first time in 75 years. The shale revolution has seen domestic U.S. crude oil production surge to around 11.7 million barrels per day. Plentiful supplies of crude oil are also making U.S. refiners more competitive, encouraging them to boost output of refined products like gasoline, diesel and jet fuel. This net export status is unlikely to be a regular occurrence in 2019. But the U.S. is likely to continue its path towards energy independence, reshaping the global markets. In 2016, 47 percent of the crude oil run in U.S. refineries was from abroad. This fell to almost 41 percent during 2018, and could well ease lower still in 2019. The U.S. is becoming an important supplier of crude oil to the world. U.S. crude exports increased by more than 80 percent year on year, according to the latest EIA data. This trend towards increased exports is likely to continue in 2019, boosted by infrastructure developments on the U.S. Gulf Coast and new market mechanisms such as CME Group\\'s WTI Houston Crude Oil Futures.\\n \\n\\n The Big Three The new status of the U.S. as a major oil producer as well as consumer has changed the dynamics of the global market. A presidential tweet can now move the oil markets up or down. The U.S. has joined Saudi Arabia and Russia as the \"big three\" most influential oil producers. The diplomatic relationship between the big three now matters deeply to the oil markets. Geopolitics is always one of the most significant drivers of oil prices, and the politically charged relationship between these three major players will be a key determinant of oil prices in 2019. LNG, Sulfur Caps and Electric Cars The drive to mitigate the potential impact of climate change is likely to intensify in 2019. An obvious beneficiary is natural gas, particularly in the form of LNG, which is steadily displacing coal around the world. A number of new U.S. LNG facilities will ramp up production in 2019, significantly increasing U.S. export capacity. The year ahead will also see the final preparations for the International Maritime Organization (IMO) sulfur cap of 0.5 percent in 2020 for the global shipping industry. This major regulatory change will require major changes by refiners and shipowners. In 2019, we can expect to see the price relationships change between higher and lower sulfur refined products and crude oil. Electric vehicles are likely to continue to capture headlines in 2019, but their impact on the energy markets will remain very limited. Refined oil products will continue to dominate transport demand for the foreseeable future. More important to the markets than a shift to electric vehicles will be the status of demand from expanding economies, with China being the standout. China imported a record 10.4 million barrels per day of crude oil in November. Any slowdown in Chinese demand in 2019 will have serious downside implications for the energy markets.\\n Trends, data and analysis can tell us something about what the year ahead might bring, but as is always the case in energy markets, there are significant uncertainties ahead.\\n']}\n",

I\\'m away in Australia visiting my in-laws, and being topsy-turvy for a while, has offered me a chance to gain some perspective on these difficult markets. As is usually the case, my confidence is best found through number crunching. So this Boxing Day, I\\'ve run the gamut on the last 50 to 100 years of stock market history to develop a statistical model of stock market returns. If you read, scan and ponder this piece, you\\'ll have a far more rational understanding of the range of possible outcomes for 2019 and beyond. :-) The range of the study I\\'ve gathered as much stock market history as I can get my hands on for both the UK and the US stock market. I\\'m using 68 years of \"FTSE All Share\" data as the proxy for the UK, and 90 years of \"S&P 500\" data. Now the more knowledgeable of you will realise that the FTSE All Share was initiated in 1962 and the S&P 500 in 1957… so these time series have been extended through some additional digging and data munging. I apologise to anyone who is a purist, but from my perspective (as an armchair statistician), the more history the better. We end up with a pair of annual time series as follows. (Please note these are capital gains only and do not include dividends). \\n\\n The average stock market return We aren\\'t comparing like with like (as the UK data set is a lot smaller), but equities tend to behave very similarly across both sides of the Atlantic. The average annual return over the whole series is a healthy 7.5%, while the standard deviation of return is plus or minus 19% around this average. For those who don\\'t remember their school maths, this means that it\\'s \"standard\" that roughly 2 in every 3 years the stock market will return somewhere between +26% and -11.5%. The FTSE All Share and S&P 500 are both down about 13% year to date… so they are just outside this standard range. I think we all forget that stock markets can be quite volatile - but it\\'s par for the course!\\n \\n\\n How often is the stock market up, and how often is it down? When stock markets go through nice lengthy bull phases, we tend to forget that they also fall. But if you understand the odds, you shouldn\\'t go into shock when it happens. It\\'s better to learn to expect it and plan accordingly. Across the full extent of this study, I found that the stock market falls approximately once every three years. 2 years up, 1 year down. \\n\\n When the stock market declines, for how many years does it continue declining? But averages are deceptive. Who goes short when the market rises for 2 years in a row? I hope nobody. The stock market is a random distribution of returns. It can go on runs… multiple years up on the trot, and multiple years down. What worries everyone right now is the prospect of another 15% or more decline in 2019… but is it right to be so worried? Here\\'s a quote from a subscriber that is typical of many: I\\'ve decided to sit out the market for the next year or two - I\\'ve a feeling a very large bear market may be on the way. (Subscriber) So let\\'s take a look at the statistics to see how likely it is that a single-year fall turns into a multi-year fall. \\n\\n\\n In the UK, 56% of declines have been single-year declines - so the next year has typically been an up-year. In 44% of cases, there was a second or third year of declines. So it\\'s better than a coin flip to be long right now, but not vastly better. But in the US, 80% (4 out of every 5) declines were met with an up-year the next year. This is quite a surprising result. Only 1 in every 5 declines has been met by a multi-year decline. This is food for thought for those sitting out of the market right now. Are the next year\\'s returns statistically better or worse after a decline in the stock market? I don\\'t see much opportunity for investment currently that does not give a lot of worry about my capital. (Another Subscriber) Is it right for us to be more worried now than a year ago? After all, the market has already fallen - so future expected returns should be higher than they were a year ago, not lower. Well, there are two ways to look at this. I\\'ve analysed the stock market returns the year after a market fall, and the year after a market rise and come up with the following statistics: \\n\\n In both the UK and the US, the typical return following a decline is 1-2% higher than average, while the typical return after a rise is lower than average. This does run completely counter to the way our monkey brains think about risk. Most believe the outlook for 2019 is worse than 2018, not better. But if you look at the second column, you can see that the standard deviation (or volatility of returns) is higher the year following a decline. This means that it\\'s more likely you\\'ll see heightened risk on either the upside or the downside following a year of negative returns. To illustrate this point, I\\'ve come up with a rather nice visualisation of this effect. This is the same data as in the very first chart posted in this article - the percentage return for every single year in the study - but sorted from low returns to high returns. Blue bands are the years following a rise, the red bands are years following a decline. You can see that there are more red bands at the extreme up and down. They eye is drawn to the red bands on the left - but it\\'s worth noting that these were clustered in some very extreme bear market years that tended to correlate with significant periods of overvaluation -> 1973-1974, 2008, and 2001-2002.\\n \\n\\n I have of course done the same for the US stock markets. This is even more startling. Almost all of the biggest rises in the stock market happened after falls the previous year. \\n\\n In conclusion If you\\'ve read my occasional musings for a while, you\\'ll know that I\\'m not keen on forecasts, and I certainly won\\'t be conjuring one today. What I do hope I\\'ve offered is a better understanding of the \"base rates\". Knowing the typical odds and placing bets accordingly generally leads to better outcomes. From a purely statistical point of view, the odds right now suggest that 2019 on average may be slightly better than average at a heightened risk of being far better than average or even far worse than average. I don\\'t think I\\'ll ever fit the word \"average\" into a sentence as many times as that ever again in my life... but there it is. So to answer the question I posed in the title… the stats suggest there\\'s a 30% chance of a stock market rally of more than 20% and a 12.5% chance that it slumps another 20%. Stock markets offer pretty random distributions of returns, and they are highly unpredictable no matter what anyone says. The pundits will always try to explain the randomness with a narrative - as we all dearly need to believe that history is linear and explicable. So the UK stock market is currently carrying the narrative of \"Brexit\" and political uncertainty as the reason for its poor return, and many British investors are considering sitting it out accordingly. But the UK stock market has actually done better than maybe a third of global stock markets this year. If you are German, Belgian, Turkish, Greek, Austrian, Italian, Spanish, Canadian, Mexican, Colombian, Chinese, Taiwanese, Korean, Japanese, etc., etc., you are hurting more than the British, and you can\\'t blame it on Brexit. Now there are a lot of other reasons to be worried… but there are always reasons to be worried.\\n I\\'d love to hear your thoughts, but I\\'m heading off into the bush with my kids for a few days. I may find some reception, I may not, but please leave your comments and I\\'ll respond when I can. Possibly from my mobile, hopefully without a leg chewed off by a croc. Safe investing.\\n']}\n"

It hasn\\'t even been four months since I admitted to having a hard time making sense of Amazon.com (AMZN) as an investment vehicle. When it came to valuation, a forward P/E of over 100x and an EV/sales of roughly 4.0x reached in the third quarter of this year made value investors (and even a few growth ones) cringe, often leading me to one logical conclusion: AMZN was an overpriced stock to avoid. On the other hand, I have always admired the company as the ultimate long-term thriver in digital commerce and, although more competently challenged by peers, cloud services. \\n\\n (Image Credit: Amazon.com\\'s IR page) Being greedy when others are fearful But there isn\\'t a problem that a bear market will not fix in a matter of weeks. AMZN has been rocked to its core over the past three month, having lost nearly one-third of its market value since the start of the fourth quarter and returning to trading at January 2018 levels. In my view, however, the nosedive has been almost fully justified by broad market jitters and risk-off attitude at a scale not seen in about one decade. The graph below helps to illustrate my opinion. Notice how, since the beginning of the current year, Amazon\\'s long-term earnings growth expectations have risen steadily from the low to the high 40s - staggering numbers for a very large company that has just recently been valued at a trillion dollars. Zooming in a bit more on recent expectations, current-year EPS consensus estimates have increased 13% to $19.80 despite the equity market correction, in part aided by a lavish 3Q18 earnings beat.\\n \\n\\nAMZN PE Ratio (Forward) data by YCharts Now, with current-year P/E heading south fast and long-term PEG of 1.5x making the stock look the most enticing as far back as I can remember, I am finally considering becoming an AMZN stock owner for the very first time. Business looks as good as ever When it comes to the company\\'s fundamentals and prospects, there isn\\'t much that properly justifies, in my view, the $300 billion loss in market value incurred over the past few months. Sure, investors might have been a bit disappointed by near-term, top-line growth expectations that failed to live up to heightened expectations. But I believe Amazon\\'s execution continues to be impressive, even more so now that expanding margins have allowed strong, double-digit revenue growth (even if slowly decelerating) to impact the bottom line more meaningfully. See the five-year trend below and notice the shift from stratospheric revenue growth to fast-rising margins and earnings over the past couple of quarters. \\n\\nAMZN Revenue (Quarterly YoY Growth) data by YCharts In terms of projections, the North America retail business could start to feel the pressure from (1) sheer scale and (2) the lapping of large acquisitions like Whole Foods, which should keep a lid on inorganic growth - about 7.5% of 3Q18 total revenues came from physical stores versus nothing in 2Q17, representing nearly one-fourth of last quarter\\'s consolidated sales growth of 29%. But I have no reason to believe that Amazon\\'s e-commerce business (about half of total revenues) will dwindle, even as retailers across the industry continue to invest heavily in their own digital channel solutions.\\n Elsewhere in the portfolio, I continue to be optimistic about the growth of subscription services like Prime Video. I also believe that Alexa will remain the catalyst to propel average Prime purchases substantially higher from current levels - perhaps even to $7,000 per year per household, as NYU professor Scott Galloway has boldly predicted. In my model, I maintain my conviction that Amazon will produce top line growth in both North America and globally of between 20% and 22.5% by 2022, but with margins now rising at a faster pace than I originally anticipated. Finally, on the AWS side, the responsible thing to do is set realistic expectations that the 40%-plus growth pace observed in each quarter of the past five years (see chart below) should slow down in the mid-to-long term. Yet, and despite pricing pressures for cloud services that even Amazon has often admitted to facing consistently, I believe cloud will continue to be a crucial factor helping to turn it into a more profitable growth company. This is particularly true because of high operating leverage that should allow a larger portion of each extra dollar of revenues earned by this business to flow into op profits and boost margins. \\n\\n (Source: D.M. Martins Research, using data from company reports) One very important consideration Having said the above, I must recognize that the current equities market has been highly unstable. On a rolling 22-trading day basis, AMZN has been experiencing increased levels of volatility not yet seen this decade (see charts below). Measured as one annualized standard deviation, volatility of 66% reached in mid-November looked a bit too uncomfortable for my taste. \\n\\n\\n (Source: D.M. Martins Research, using data from Yahoo Finance) The bottom line is that timing an entry into AMZN can be very tricky amid all the market uncertainties. I would rather monitor the stock\\'s behavior and possibly pull the trigger once I see clearer signs that a bottom has been put in place, even if doing so might mean passing up on the early stages of a share price bounceback. From a longer-term perspective, I believe AMZN is a good stock to hold. I even maintain my view that it will be the first company in the world to reach the $2 trillion market valuation, although the timing is highly speculative at this point. For now, I will continue to be patient and wait for a moment of more macro stability before finally adding AMZN to my portfolio.\\nNote from the author: If you have enjoyed this article, follow me by clicking the orange \"Follow\" button next to the header, making sure that the \"Get email alerts\" box remains checked.

CARA is a clinical stage biotech company focused primarily on treating pruritus (chronic severe itching) through targeting kappa opioid receptors. Pruritis is a severely underserved market, with treatment relying on steroids and antihistamines with no fundamentally new therapies in decades (Cara web site). This puts CARA's lead drug candidate CR845 (Korsuva™) in an exciting position to fundamentally change the way pruritis is managed and treated. CARA’s stock price has come down significantly this quarter, along with other small and mid cap biopharma companies in this indiscriminate 4th quarter 2018 correction, such that CARA is now priced at almost 50% of its 52 week high without any negative data to justify the selloff. With numerous mid and late-stage pruritis readouts coming in 2019 that in our view have a good chance of success, we see CARA as a significantly undervalued opportunity for pre-commercial biopharma investors. Pipeline\\n CARA's lead asset Korsuva™ (CR845) is a kappa opioid agonist, which is different from traditional pain drugs targeting mu opioid receptors (morphine, oxycodone, etc.). Based on results of clinical trials, CARA has evolved their main focus for Korsuva™ from pain to pruritis, which is prudent in our view, because the pruritis data for Korsuva™ looks much more convincing and competitive. CARA currently has 2 phase 3 registration trials ongoing for Korsuva™ injection (IV Korsuva™) for pruritis in chronic kidney disease patients, a phase 2 trial of oral Korsuva™ in stage III-V chronic kidney disease, and a Phase 1 trial of Korsuva™ in chronic liver disease (see figure below) that are all scheduled to read out in 2019. \\n\\n (From Cara 2018 Investor Slides) In mid-2017 the FDA granted Breakthrough Therapy designation to IV CR845 (IV Korsuva™) for the treatment of moderate-to-severe uremic pruritus (UP) in chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients undergoing hemodialysis. This decision was primarily supported by the positive results from the phase 2 trial of IV CR845 in patients with UP. (Cara Press Release) Below is CARA’s pipeline as of November 2018. Korsuva™ Injection Korsuva™ injection (IV Korsuva™) for the treatment of pruritis associated with Chronic Kidney Disease for patients on hemodialysis (CKD-HD aP) (also called uremic pruritus) is CARA’s most advanced clinical indication. They currently have two ongoing phase 3 trials, KALM-I in the US, and KALM-II global, with an interim readout coming at the end of Q4 2018 or early in 2019 for KALM-I, and topline data in 2019. In our view, the Phase 3 trials have a high likelihood of success based on the design and results of the phase 2 trials of Korsuva™ in this same patient population. The phase 2 trial met all primary and secondary endpoints. See the table below for a comparison of the two trials:\\n   Phase 2 Trial Phase 3 (KALM-1/KALM-2) Trials   Doses: 0.5, 1.0, and 1.5 ug/kog Dose: 0.5 ug/kg   Treatment Period: 8 weeks Treatment Period: 12 weeks   Primary Endpoint: Change from Baseline in Worst Itching Intensity (NRS) score – responder analysis Primary Endpoint: Change (>= 3 point improvement) from Baseline in Worst Itching Intensity (NRS) score   The difference in the trials is the extension of the treatment period from 8 weeks to 12 weeks in the phase 3 trial. In the phase 2 data for the primary endpoint, change from baseline in NRS Worst Itching Intensity score (averaged), the CR845 treatment groups appeared to differentiate further from placebo over time, with the greatest improvement over placebo seen at the last time points (see graph below). Furthermore, the CR845 combined dose score exceeded the phase 3 primary endpoint cutoff of an improvement in NRS worst itching of at least 3 points starting at week 7. \\n\\n (From Cara 2018 Phase 2 Poster) An even more apparent increasing separation trend was seen for the 0.5 ug/kg cohort when analyzing proportion of patients achieving the phase 3 target of a change in worst itch of greater than or equal to 3 points (CARA Final Results presentation). In fact, 64% of patients treated with CR845 at 0.5 ug/kg vs. 29% of patients taking placebo, achieved an itch score improvement of greater than or equal to 3 points on the NRS scale (p<0.01) (CARA Final Results presentation). \\n\\n\\n (CARA Final Results presentation) There is also an ongoing open label extension study up to 52 weeks with dosing of 0.5 mcg/kg, and about 50% of patients have completed 6 months of treatment with no unexpected adverse events thus far. (Cara Nov Investor Slides) One result from the Phase 2 trial that gives us some concern, is the reverse dose response. That is, the 0.5 ug/kg dose, which is the Phase 3 dose, showed better improvement from the placebo than the 2 higher doses tested. However, all 3 doses tested showed statistical significance, and it is possible that off-target effects counteract some of the effectiveness of Korsuva™, for example. Furthermore, the company has shown that even at 0.5 ug/kg dose, plasma concentrations of Korsuva™ are receptor saturating. (Cara Nov Investor Slides) Both phase 3 trials for Korsuva™ (US and rest of world), including an interim powering analysis. The upcoming interim analysis for KALM-I is expected at the end of Q4 2018 or early 2019 and is being carried out by an independent data monitoring committee (IDMC), which will assess and recommend for expansion to up to 500 patients if necessary to hit predefined statistical powering for endpoint analysis. We find the market reaction to the interim read-out hard to predict. However, if the market reacts negatively to a recommended expansion, this interim readout may offer an even more attractive entry point into the stock. CARA has stated that there is no futility analysis in this analysis, but there is still uncertainty around the outcome and market reaction. Even if the IDMC recommends expansion to 500 patients, we remain positive on the topline results coming in 2019 based on the Phase 2 data. Korsuva™ Oral CKD CARA is running clinical trials for oral Korsuva™ in three pruritis-associated indications, with the latest being for pruritis associated with Chronic Kidney Disease patients stage 3-5 (CKD-3-5). The phase 2 trial should read out in 2019. The phase 1 data showed favorable PK/PD results with exposure levels in line with Korsuva™ injection. The phase 1 trial was conducted in stage 3-5 CKD patients. CARA noted the adverse events were similar between the treatment and placebo groups. The phase 2 trial will be a 12 week dose finding study evaluating the change from baseline to week 12 in the Worst Itching Intensity score. We expect that the phase 2 trial will be a major catalyst for CARA in 2019, given the overall market opportunity with oral Korsuva™ in kidney disease, as well as pruritis more generally.\\n Liver and skin CARA is also looking to expand Korsuva™ into other indications, with the hope eventually of obtaining data to support a broad pruritis label. A phase 2 study of oral Korsuva™ in Chronic Liver Disease associated pruritis (CLD aP) is planned to be initiated by year-end 2018 or early 2019. The expansion of Korsuva™ to indications outside of kidney disease, expands the market potential for Korsuva™ significantly. Other Indications for Korsuva™ CARA also completed a phase 3 trial for post-operation pain using CR845 IV. Even though the trial achieved its primary pain endpoint, CARA has apparently concluded that the pain reduction was not significant enough to be competitive. However CR845 showed good activity in terms of nausea/vomiting, a secondary endpoint and a common side effect with post-op pain management. This gives the drug an interesting possible position in this post-op pain landscape. CARA has stated that pruritis is their main focus, and they plan to partner out Korsuva™ for this indication. This is an interesting upside possibility. However, as you’ll see below, currently this opportunity represents only a small portion of CARA’s value in our view. Competition Currently, there are no approved therapies in the US specifically for the treatment of CKD-aP. Current therapies include corticosteroids and antihistamines (Cara web site). There is an approved product in Japan marketed by Toray Industries called Nalfurafine, which is an antipuritic drug marketed for the treatment of CKD-aP in hemodialysis patients. Nalfurafine is sold under the brand name REMITCH. REMITCH is a selective kappa opioid receptor agonist, and is taken daily orally via 2.5 ug capsule. However, Nalfurafine has partial mu-opioid receptor activity, which may actually cause itching, and crosses the blood-brain barrier, which according to CARA causes CNS adverse events and leads to high discontinuation rates (See CARA 10-K for the fiscal year ending Dec 31, 2017, available at sec.gov). According to CARA, the limited efficacy in light of concerns about adverse events caused European Medinices Agency not to approve Nalfurafine for the treatment of uremic pruritus in 2013 (Id.).\\n Value CARA recently partnered Korsuva™ with Vifor Fresenius Medical Care Renal Pharma (VFMCRP), a global leader in dialysis (Press Release). The agreement consists of an upfront payment, regulatory/commercial milestones, a profit split, tiered double digit royalties, and a $20 million investment in CARA from VFMCRP (see Sumarry below). Overall the deal provides confidence from a market leader, in IV Korsuva™, as well as a strategic partnership. \\n\\n (From Cara Slide Deck) For us, and institutional investors too based on the positive stock price reaction when the VFMCRP deal was announced, the VFMCRP deal added significant current value to CARA because it significantly derisks commercial success and provides further technical validation of CARA’s data. CARA has a big opportunity in the pruritis market. Approximately one half of hemodialysis patients with chronic kidney disease, about 300,000 people in the US alone, suffer from CKD-HD aP (Pisoni et al., Nephrol Dial Transplant, 2006:21: 3495; Vrucinic et al, Our Dermatol Online 3, 2015; and CARA presentation). Of these 300,000 people about 1/3 are in the Fresenius dialysis clinics where CARA will receive a 50/50 profit split. In the EU, CARA will receive a 20% royalty. Fresenius already has these U.S. patients and many EU patients coming through their clinics, which should give them a big advantage in terms of the speed at which this segment of the market can be captured. CARA will need to capture the other 2/3 of the U.S. market themselves, but will retain 100% revenue from this segment unless they choose to partner some or all of this out too. Oral Korsuva™ is at an earlier stage of development, but has a much larger market opportunity. Approximately 2.5 million people suffer from CKD 3-5 aP in the US who are not on dialysis, and therefore are candidates for oral Korsuva ™. Furthermore, as mentioned above, oral Korsuva™ may be effective for treating pruritis outside of kidney disease, in large markets with unmet needs such as liver and skin diseases. Oral Korsuva™ has the possibility of becoming a huge asset as it advances through trials. Furthermore, CR845 as an anti-emetic in a post-op setting has value as a future partnered asset.\\n Below we display our current probability adjusted peak revenues for each indication. CARA asserts that it has composition of matter and methods of use patent protection for Korsuva™ expiring no earlier than 2026, with at least one composition of matter patent issued in the U.S. expiring in November 2027 (See CARA 10-K for fiscal year ending Dec 31, 2017, available at sec.gov). This should give CARA and its partners sufficient time before possible generic entrants, to hit at least $1 billion in risk adjusted peak revenues, if it can successfully market Korsuva™. With this conservative probability adjusted peak US and EU combined revenues of around $1 billion, over 2 times the current CARA market cap (~$500M), CARA currently appears significantly undervalued in our view based on a total revenue multiplier model. Even just a 2x multiplier, 6 years to peak revenue, and a 12.5% discount rate would yield a stock price over $30, more than 2x the current price ($12.69), and most mid-cap biopharmas have multipliers of over 4x revenue. In our modeling, the value of CARA can swing considerably depending on the results of 2019 clinical trial readouts. Positive IV and oral Korsuva™ 2019 data readouts would reduce regulatory risk and add over 50% to our risk-adjusted peak revenues, thereby increasing target share price accordingly. Negative risks on share price are discussed below. Risks Like any pre-commercial biopharma company, investment in CARA has significant risks. For example, Korsuva™ might not meet its primary endpoint in any of its upcoming clinical trial read-outs. For example, we do not find any pruritis efficacy data on Korsuva™ out to 12 weeks, the primary endpoint for the upcoming phase 3 study readouts, and unexpected changes may occur in efficacy after the 8 week timepoint, which was the latest timepoint of the phase 2 trial. Furthermore, although oral Korsuva™ at a dose of 1 mg per day appears to attain exposure levels similar to those successfully employed in injections in intravenous patients, CARA has not established that such oral doses are effective at treating pruritis. If any of the late-stage trials fail, it would likely have an over 25% negative effect on share price, although by our rough valuations, even just IV Korsuva regulatory success could support the current CARA stock price longer-term. Furthermore, like most pre-commercial biopharma companies, CARA loses money every quarter and might run out of money to fund ongoing efforts before it reaches profitability. CARA ended Q3, 2018 with slightly more than $200M in cash and short-term investments, which the company projects will last into 2021 (Q3, 2018 Transcript).\\n Conclusion We see CARA’s current stock price providing an attractive valuation going into 2019 with major readouts coming in CKD. The pruritis indication has natural expansion into pruritis associated with other diseases outside of the kidney, which provides further upside for CARA. Overall given the previous clinical data, and our valuation modeling, we see CARA as an attractive current risk/reward opportunity for investors having an appetite for high-risk, pre-commercial biopharma stocks.\\nDisclosure: I am/we are long CARA.

Before proceeding, allow me to provide an overview of the week\\'s share price movements of the top ten holdings of the KraneShares CSI China Internet ETF (KWEB) for easy reference during the discussion in the subsequent sections. \\n\\n KWEB Price data by YCharts Google\\'s China Plans Disrupted; Respite For Baidu The Intercept reported last Tuesday that Alphabet\\'s Google had paused its plans to build a filtered search engine for China, following objections from employees and internal conflicts over the project. With the rumors of the potential re-entry of Google into the massive Chinese market now effectively squashed, shareholders of Baidu should heave a sigh of relief. In the past months, the project which was nicknamed Dragonfly had spurred a hive of analyses from Seeking Alpha contributors into its competitive edge and implications over the local search engines, and in particular, the leading player by far, Baidu.\\n \\n\\n Source: Google News (screenshot of sample coverage on Google\\'s threat to Baidu by Seeking Alpha contributors) It is hard to quantify what the impact of the rumor had on Baidu\\'s share price since it surfaced in August, given that it happened amid a broader stock market decline. Whatever the case, the Chinese search giant would surely be glad to have one less burden on its shoulder. Nevertheless, it\\'s interesting to note that Google CEO Sundar Pichai declined to rule out a re-entry into China in the future during the session with the US Congress two weeks ago. \\n\\n BIDU data by YCharts Richard Liu, JD.com\\'s Founder Won\\'t Be Charged On Friday, the share price of JD.com saw a spike in the afternoon following headlines from Dow Jones Newswire that Richard Liu Qiangdong, JD.com\\'s founder, wouldn\\'t be charged in the Minnesota sexual assault case. JD.com had slumped earlier in the day before the related reports emerged, in line with the broader stock market, but shot up around 10 percent in less than half an hour. Some profit-taking ensued and it eventually closed up nearly 6 percent, but it rose again in after-hours trading. \\n\\n\\n JD Price data by YCharts According to a press release from the Hennepin County Attorney\\'s Office, Hennepin County Attorney Michael Freeman said the following: \"There were profound evidentiary problems which would have made it highly unlikely that any criminal charge could be proven beyond a reasonable doubt.\" The market has clearly cheered the absence of any criminal charge against Richard Liu. However, Wil Florin, the attorney for the now-22-year-old student who accused Liu of rape, said his client will file a civil lawsuit. This means that the distraction from the case could continue when the civil lawsuit proceeds. Earlier this year, when the share price of JD.com was riding high on investor euphoria, such incidents might be shrugged off by the market. However, in the current bearish environment, investors might not be forgiving. The market is also watching whether the company has given a serious consideration towards succession planning especially after the scare a few months ago from the possibility that he could be incriminated and imprisoned. JD.com - Moving Beyond The Sexual Assault Case Nevertheless, things are looking brighter for JD.com. JD.com saw another bout of selling following the announcement of its Q3 2018 results. Since then, its share price has been moving sideways, breaking away from the downtrend which began in June. Investor interest could have been piqued by the positive vibes from the recent earnings conference call. In response to analysts\\' questions regarding the growth strategy for JD.com posed during the earnings conference call, Richard Liu outlined several drivers for an improved net profit setup next year. \\n\\n JD data by YCharts Given the barrage of negative media coverage and internet discussions of JD.com, it is understandable that shareholders\\' confidence is wavering. Nevertheless, investors might do well to focus on the fundamentals, perhaps by first being updated about the latest corporate developments. The news coverage by Seeking Alpha (see the following snapshot) is great to begin with, as it has a collection of key press releases, analyst actions, and media mentions.\\n \\n\\n Source: Seeking Alpha More directly, investors can refer to the corporate blog maintained by JD.com itself. In the past month alone, there appear to be four interesting developments (see \"Latest Posts\" section in the following snapshot). The latest post wrote about the launch of a new research lab between JD.com and Intel (INTC) in the field of \"smart retail\". The joint lab aims to leverage JD\\'s big data analysis capabilities and Intel\\'s advanced edge computing technologies to \"develop next-generation vending machines, media and advertising solutions, and technologies to be used in the stores of the future\". When these capabilities come into fruition, JD.com would be able to realize additional revenues. \\n\\n Source: JD.com Corporate Blog In the prior post dated December 7, 2018, JD.com announced the launch of its blockchain-based pharmaceutical tracking solution. It aims to address concerns in China about the authenticity of medicines by providing consumers with reliable and transparent tracing information. This follows its renewed efforts into big data and \"smart\" supply chain initiatives. Taking the lead for the development of an entire IoT ecosystem of devices to promote medical traceability, JD.com stands to benefit from being the pioneer and entrench its position as a key logistics partner.    \"The move comes after a handful of recent pharmaceutical safety incidents in China concerning substandard products, particularly when it comes to vaccines, which have been found to be expired or below safety standards in the past. As a result, Chinese consumers are increasingly concerned about the safety and origin of the medicine they consume. In light of this, JD is teaming up with industry partners including medical software providers, industry associations, and smart hardware manufacturers to develop an entire IoT ecosystem of devices to promote medical traceability, raising standards and increasing transparency across the industry.\" \\n The next two recent announcements referred to other partnerships, embodiments of JD.com\\'s strategy of forming allies to tackle bigger players (e.g. Alibaba (BABA). New Games Approvals Jolted The Share Prices of NetEase And Tencent Three weeks ago, I wrote about the \"possible thawing of the new video games approval freeze in China\", following the setting up of an assessment committee for the review of games. The Publicity Department of the Communist Party of China (CPC) Central Committee had said then that it aimed to provide the public with \"healthy entertainment products\" and \"protect adolescents\" from the negative impact of online gaming. Last Friday, we finally have the official statement that several new video games were approved for sale. Reuters reported that Feng Shixin, a senior official of the ruling Communist Party\\'s Propaganda Department, revealed the good news for games makers in a speech at a gaming conference in the southern city of Haikou, China. \"We hope through new system design and strong implementation we could guide game companies to better present mainstream values, strengthen a cultural sense of duty and mission, and better satisfy the public need for a better life.\" - Feng Shixin, a senior official of the ruling Communist Party\\'s Propaganda Department Shares of gaming giants NetEase (NTES) and Tencent (OTCPK:TCEHY) (OTCPK:TCTZF) jumped on the news but closed with lesser gains as the broader stock market slumped through the day. NetEase rose as much as 7 percent in early trading on Friday before ending the session up 3.6 percent. Tencent saw a more tepid start after having closed up 4.6 percent in Hong Kong trading, but also ended up near the gains of NetEase. Nevertheless, the increases were respectable considering the Nasdaq 100 declined by 3.2 percent. \\n\\n\\n NTES Price data by YCharts Cui Chenyu, senior research analyst for games at information and analytics titan IHS Markit (INFO), reckoned shareholders should not pop the champagne yet: \"Restarting license approval does not mean that Chinese regulators will ease up on gaming control. In fact, we believe Beijing will further regulate the content of video games. That, in turn, will drive up gaming companies\\' production costs.\" Kern Zhang, an analyst with App Annie, a market researcher specializing in online games, is similarly pessimistic: \"The license resumption definitely cannot end the gaming industry\\'s struggle.\" I am more sanguine. Even if the tightened regulatory supervision would increase the production costs, it just means fewer profits. Surely, that is a superior scenario to having no production costs and no revenue when games approvals are frozen. In addition, the drought in approvals has consolidated the gaming industry, further strengthening the leadership positions of Tencent and NetEase. The resumption of approvals but with stringent policies in place could mean that smaller players find it tougher to operate, tilting the operational advantage overwhelmingly to the larger gaming companies. Another silver-lining from the games approval freeze is that executives at Tencent and NetEase have accelerated measures to diversify their revenue sources. The prior bloodletting of the market cap of the two gaming giants has priced in the missed revenue due to the pause in approvals. What investors can count on in the coming months are the twin engines of growth - the return in gaming growth, as well as the materialization of the initiatives to grow non-gaming businesses. An early indication of the success in diversification is the tremendous growth in the mobile gaming revenue from outside China. IHS Markit reported that Tencent and NetEase together recorded $376 million in international mobile games revenue from January through mid-November 2018. This represents a 382 percent increase compared to the entire calendar year of 2017 when the companies\\' combined international revenues was only $78 million. NetEase has an edge in the international push, as seen from its 72 percent share of this combined company revenue growth.\\n \\n\\n China\\'s Top Leadership Pledges Deeper Tax Cuts, Ample Liquidity, And Enhanced Government Spending In my prior article ALT Perspective Positions For 2019: Amid Headwinds, Opportunities For Chinese Internet Stocks, I elaborated at length the high correlation between the performance of Chinese Internet stocks and the macro environment. Hence, with multiple tailwinds supporting the Chinese economy, Chinese Internet stocks would similarly be lifted. In the US, President Donald Trump has openly criticized the moves by the Federal Reserve Chairman, Jerome Powell. Over in China, the central bank is actually in line with the central government to juice up the local economy. It unveiled a new tool to encourage lending to small and private enterprises by offering preferential interest rates to major banks offering loans to such businesses. This announcement is yet another example of the resolve of the People\\'s Bank of China (\"PBOC\") to \"ensure reasonable and sufficient liquidity in the banking system\". Following the conclusion of the Central Economic Work Conference, an annual gathering of top party leaders and policymakers, media outlets rushed to highlight the Chinese government\\'s intention to \"significantly\" cut taxes, keep liquidity ample, and increase spending for infrastructure. It\\'s all good sounding although the efforts might only be sufficient to avoid a sharp deceleration in the world\\'s second-largest economy, not spur growth a la 2010-2011. Nevertheless, given the steep fall in the stock market, perhaps that is already sufficient to stimulate a rebound. Market Outlook Recent mass layoffs at Chinese Internet companies have been viewed by the \"glass-half-full\" camp as a shift in the sector\\'s growth toward quality and efficiency and the opposite side as further validation of a worsening in the industry woes. Online travel agency Qunar.com, Inc. had purportedly dismissed more than a hundred employees after the company terminated a major project. Food delivery services operator, Meituan-Dianping (MEIT), also saw layoffs.\\n Of particular interest these days are the damaging reports of app-based bike-sharing companies facing liquidity challenges. Ofo, backed by Alibaba Group, was reportedly facing a shortage of funds to pay suppliers. The negative coverage exacerbated the situation as users are now pressuring the company to refund their deposits. Its main rival, Tencent-backed Mobike, said Hu Weiwei, its co-founder and CEO, would step down for \"personal reasons\". Such adverse developments are leading market players to speculate a more challenging 2019, not just for the companies themselves but also their backers such as Tencent and Alibaba, the Kingmakers for smaller companies. What\\'s your take? Are you bullish or bearish about Chinese Internet stocks in 2019? Editors\\' Note: Chinese Internet Weekly is an exclusive weekly newsletter for PRO+ and Essential subscribers.

Consumer spending this holiday season has set records. S&P 500 earnings per share are expected to leap by more than 20% in 2018 – and to see further growth in 2019 to nearly $175 per share. Over the past few months, however, equity markets have fallen into a painful bear market. The cause of the bear market has nothing to do with the economy, and everything to do with politics and policy. First, market participants are concerned that the Federal Reserve is draining liquidity too quickly from the financial system by shrinking its balance sheet and raising interest rates. This could lead to a Fed “policy error” that constrains economic growth. Second, investors are deeply worried by President Trump’s repeated criticism of the Federal Reserve as the independence of the Federal Reserve has now come under threat. Third, markets are reacting to repeated political crises including the government shutdown, the US-China trade war, the increasingly partisan atmosphere in Washington, DC, and haphazard efforts of US officials that keep making things worse, not better. President Trump Should Pull His Fed Nominees The market crisis is a political crisis, not an economic crisis. It is within the power of the Trump Administration to not only contain the crisis, but reverse it. There are several steps President Trump can immediately take to restore confidence. First, President Trump should unequivocally declare that he respects the independence of the Federal Reserve and affirm that he has no intention nor legal ability to remove Chairman Powell. This would have an immediate calming effect on markets.\\n Second, President Trump should pull his two Fed nominees. Of the seven permanent members of the Federal Reserve Open Market Committee (the “FOMC”) that sets monetary policy, two of the seats are currently vacant. President Trump has appointed Marvin Goodfriend and Nellie Liang to fill the two openings. Neither nominee aligns with President Trump’s dovish monetary policy views. Goodfriend is a skeptic of quantitative easing and leans hawkish overall – the opposite of the President’s views. Liang has come under fire from fellow Republicans for her aggressive regulatory record. Both nominees have faced considerable opposition in the US Senate and are unlikely to be confirmed. Replacing his candidates with qualified nominees who better align with the President’s policy views does nothing to undermine the Federal Reserve’s independence – in fact, by following historical norms, this step would reaffirm the Fed’s autonomy. At the same time, such a move would send a clear signal to the markets that the Fed will soon shift more dovish and that future nominees will similarly shift the Fed in an accommodative direction. Importantly, there are many credible candidates the President could select. Neel Kashkari, the current President of the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis, is a dovish Republican who previously was the party’s nominee for Governor of California. Kashkari’s predecessor at the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis, Narayana Kocherlakota, is another widely-respected monetary dove. James Bullard, the President of the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, is a third dovish policymaker who would align with the President’s views. The one-two punch of confirming Fed independence followed by the appointment of two doves to the FOMC would both restore market confidence and shift market sentiment as investors see the odds of a Fed “policy error” reduce amidst a more dovish Fed. A Resolution To Political Crisis Will Instill Confidence Importantly, the President can take additional steps to underline investor confidence.\\n The government shutdown is clearly affecting sentiment. The White House has already softened its language on a number of negotiating points – asking for a “fence” or “slats” instead of a “wall” and backing off the initial request of $5B+ to a lower figure – that suggest the White House is seeking a path out of the shutdown. A resolution of the crisis would be a meaningful positive for the market. The US-China trade war is another overhang. Again, President Trump continues to highlight his confidence that a deal can be reached, and China continues taking steps indicating progress is being made. Should the rift be overcome, market confidence would soar. Finally, a massive infrastructure bill would receive considerable bi-partisan support from Congress. The President repeatedly spoke of infrastructure investment as a core plank of his campaign platform. To-date, he has not delivered. A divided Congress presents the President with an opportunity to achieve a bi-partisan victory while also delivering on a campaign promise. A successful infrastructure stimulus would further boost the economy and markets. Investor Positioning Is Deeply Negative – The Pain Trade Is Up There is a clear path available to the President to restore market confidence. If he is successful – or even modestly successful – the equity markets may be poised to rip higher. Why? Because investors are offsides. Investor positioning is deeply bearish at the moment, with investors hiding in cash, de-grossing, and drawing down net exposure. Investor sentiment, according to the CNN Fear & Greed Index, is showing “extreme fear”. \\n\\nSource: CNN, https://money.cnn.com/data/fear-and-greed/ The AAII survey of market views shows bears outnumbering bulls by the highest degree since 2009.\\n In addition to the bearish sentiment, stocks are (finally) cheap. Should the S&P 500 achieve $175 per share in earnings in 2019, the S&P 500 is only trading at 13.8x earnings. Excluding FAANG stocks, the market is likely trading closer to 11x earnings. For a healthy, growing developed economy, this is unusually attractive. In short, stocks are cheap but investors are poorly positioned for a move higher. Should the Trump Administration take even modest steps to resolve the political crises weighing on the market, the rebound could come fast and hard as investors race to get re-invested. In such circumstances, the “pain trade” – the market move that will catch the most investors by surprise – is up.

Cracks are already starting to show with their \"mobility\" segment - the one that provides wireless services being the only one to grow last quarter (5.1%) with the others contracting due to \"cord cutting\", an event that has recently escalated with people now consuming digital media.\\n\\n (Source: Q3 earnings) As can be seen, by the image above, even the mobility section is not enough to increase their profits, with them also decreasing for the quarter if it wasn\\'t for the WarnerMedia acquisition. Moreover, although I believe this acquisition should provide a short-term boost to their numbers, the consequences of the debt used to finance it means it could be a liability in the long term. Even the idea that their growth will alleviate pressure on the main business is unfounded, due to the fierce competition in the media industry. For example, WarnerMedia\\'s streaming service, set to be released in 2019, will not only have the established giants such as Netflix (NFLX) to contend with, but also the newcomers such as Disney\\'s Hulu (DIS). Although their library of content is indeed large, I believe carving out a profitable business in an already crowded industry will be very hard to achieve.\\n Although I claim to be no expert on AT&T\\'s business, it is hard to imagine them growing much faster than inflation due to structural headwinds. This means anyone investing in the company is doing so mainly for the dividends, and the low volatility that they should be able to achieve. On the other hand... an investor in Enbridge is buying part of one of the most diversified pipeline operators in the world. Its assets include:  34,410 miles of natural gas pipelines 17,511 miles of oil pipelines 11.4 billion cubic feet/day of gas processing capacity 437 billion cubic feet of gas storage capacity 307,000 barrels/day of natural gas liquids or NGL production capacity 3.5 million natural gas utility customers 3GW of renewable energy capacity 71% of Canada\\'s pipeline capacity  These have allowed them to transport over 20% of North American oil, and 28% of its natural gas last year. In itself, this would be a spectacular feat, yet what distinguished Enbridge from other asset-heavy business\\'s (such as AT&T) is the fact that demand for their product is increasing at a rapid pace. \\n\\n (Source: EIA) Despite the belief that renewable energies are set to take over fossil fuels in the near future, as this graph shows this is not the case. This means that until at least 2050, Enbridge will continue to invest heavily in new infrastructure and maintain double-digit growth rates, with them growing 17% YOY last quarter. Moreover, Enbridge\\'s main source of cash flow is its long-term contracts with companies for capacity along their pipelines. They last anywhere from 10-30 years and mean their cash flow is immune from fluctuations in oil prices. This was evident in 2014, when oil crashed, almost reaching 20$ a barrel. Despite this, Enbridge still managed to grow its dividend and continue operations as normal whereas many others in their industry were forced to cut or greatly reduce their investments.\\n What this all means is that Enbridge has a far greater chance of growing their underlying business, and does so whilst taking on a smaller amount of risk. This safety should reflect on their price as this increased cash flow is rewarded to shareholders. 2: Dividend - Enbridge unseats AT&T for the best income stock. Although Enbridge is the better growth vehicle, it is argued that AT&T is a far better investment due to the dividend. It is very large, growing and is one of the safest in its industry. If you focus only on the first 2 statements (I disagree with the last which I will discuss shortly), it does appear to be an income investors dream. Yet due to Enbridge\\'s superior operations, it has managed to both reach parity with AT&T\\'s yield (which has traditionally been far greater) and is growing at a rate of 10%. This isn\\'t just a one off occasion either, as the chart below shows. \\n\\n They have been managing to grow at this rate for over 20 years, and plan to continue doing so until 2020. If I assume this will be the case, and 6% growth from then on (conservative compared to others estimates) then your yield on cost would be 13.5% in 10 years time. AT&T would only have a yield of 8.5% by then, (assuming growth of 2% a year) meaning investors would be receiving 5% less a year. As anyone who has studied compound interest would tell you, just a 1% difference in your returns can make a large difference to your end result. From that perspective, 5% is brutal and is a clear reason to favor Enbridge over AT&T. It is simply a far better stock for income investors looking for long-term dividend growth. 3: Valuation - AT&T may be undervalued, but so is Enbridge Investors in both AT&T and Enbridge have felt the pain of the market undervaluing their assets over the past few years, with each able to make a valid case as to why their stock price is currently undervalued. Both have declined significantly from their highs, despite improvements in their fundamentals (albeit small for AT&T) meaning that they are attractively valued based on historical PE, PS etc.\\n However, when comparing the two companies, Enbridge does come out ahead. Unlike AT&T, whose weakness is due mainly to regulatory issues and the market anticipating the slow growth environment I have mentioned, Enbridge is down mainly due to the bear market in its industry since 2015. This has unfairly hurt all stocks, regardless of their performance, and has caused Enbridge to suffer. Likewise, the purchase of Spectra in 2015, although giving long-term benefits, has caused problems as Enbridge incorporates these assets into their main business. Looking at the bigger picture, Enbridge\\'s weakness looks to be resolving, with uncertainties being addressed, whereas AT&T\\'s look like they will continue into the future. Although AT&T is undervalued, its negative sentiment means it can stay that way for a long time, and can trade at lower valuations than it has previously done. This can be seen over the last few weeks, with AT&T continuing to fall whilst Enbridge rebounded after reaching a critical technical level at around $30 If you take all of this into consideration, it makes sense why Morningstar gives Enbridge a rare 5-star rating, and a fair value estimate almost double their price ($62) but only gives AT&T a 4-star rating and fair value estimate of $37 - a 25% premium but nowhere near as good, Simply put, AT&T may be cheap, but Enbridge is cheaper. 4: Risks: Large debt load vs simplified structure and a strengthening credit rating. Enbridge and AT&T each have their fair share of risks, due to the nature of operating in highly regulated industries. Whereas Enbridge looks to be rapidly solving these problems, AT&T\\'s look to only be just beginning, which could be one of the main reasons that the market is currently discounting their price. For an example of this, take AT&T\\'s debt pile. In just the last 3 years, it has more than doubled and now stands at over $180 billion dollars. This is more debt than many countries have and is a result of their rapid expansion to fuel future growth. Furthermore, much of this debt reaches maturity over the next 5-8 years, impacting their ability to transform their business over the coming years. Although I do believe that AT&T should be able to pay off their debt in the near term, this presents a constant drag on their business that will have to either be met by a decrease in future growth (selling parts of the business or using capital to pay off), or a decrease in expenses (cutting the dividend, etc.)\\n \\n\\n(Source: SA article) This isn\\'t just a small issue either, but the reason that Moodys cut their investment grade from Baa1 to Baa2. This increased risk could impact their ability to finance future debt at low yields, as investors wish for a greater return for the increased risk. With the recent events affecting General Electric (GE), who were forced to cut their dividend due to debts themselves, this is not something I want to see. Whether or not this does affect AT&T in such a way in the future, this is definitely not the \"sleep well at night\" stock that it once was. On the other hand, Enbridge, another company that has made large investments in the last few years, is managing to steadily decrease its debt- EBITDA level. It now stands at only 4.7x, their lowest in recent history and well ahead of their 2018 target of 5.0x. By 2020, this is expected to be only 4.5x, one of the best in the industry. This has allowed them to become self-funding, as is evident by them stopping of their DRIP program which was previously used to fund growth. \\n\\n This, along with the recent approval to absorb the remaining shares with the affiliated companies Spectra Energy Partners (SEP), Enbridge Energy Partners (EEP), Enbridge Energy Management (EEQ), and Enbridge Income Fund Holdings (OTC: EBGUF) to simplify their corporate structure, is the reason that Moodys plans to increase their credit rating after proceedings have finished. Finally, the recent problems surrounding their line 3 pipeline are now resolved, with regulators giving the go-ahead to continue work on completing the project. This is one of their main sources of future growth, and so it being completed on time is crucial if Enbridge\\'s timeline is to be met. Besides, management has shown consistently that they can overcome hurdles, and so I am confident that any future delays won\\'t cause the issues that some expect.\\n \\n\\n While both companies do have some issues, Enbridge\\'s are mainly short-term, whereas AT&T\\'s are long-term structural problems that have been built up over the past 5-10 years. Unfortunately, such balance sheet damage is not easily reversed, which is why I believe Enbridge is now a safer investment and should continue to be in the future. Conclusion AT&T and Enbridge are both great companies, and the most likely scenario is that they both continue to do well over the coming years. When it comes to choosing between the two, Enbridge is clearly a superior investment due to their faster growth, allowing for greater share price returns over the long-term. Despite this warranting a premium, they are also at a greater discount to their fair valuation and have fewer substantial risks which could affect their business over the coming decades. This is why I am investing in Enbridge over AT&T, and am strongly in favor of investors also doing so at current prices.\\nDisclosure: I am/we are long ENB.

If maintained, its ability to \"recycle\" its intellectual property combined with the high-quality of games it produces will lead to great success for the company many years into the future. Recycling Assets The great thing about being a company that develops video games under a number of different principal franchises is that Nintendo can re-use the \"assets\" within similar games repeatedly. In this case, assets refer to the files, music, 3D models and computer code which make up video games. This re-use has occurred a number of times with some of the company\\'s biggest titles. For example, Nintendo was able to put to use assets from Super Mario Galaxy (one of the most popular games of all time) in Super Mario Galaxy 2 (an even more well-received title). Purportedly, this is the plan again for Nintendo\\'s sequel to Breath of the Wild, which is very likely to appear on the Switch console. The fact that many of the same assets will be re-deployed is great news for the company when you consider that the first title cost almost $100 million to develop. In any case, this wasn\\'t a problem for the Japanese developer, which sold more than five times the two million copies of the game it needed to break even. Recycling Franchises While recycling in-game assets is great, from a broader perspective, perhaps even more useful to Nintendo for the long term is the fact that the company can make games under a strong selection of different franchises which it has the exclusive rights to. Among the most successful franchises owned by the company are Mario Kart, Pikmin, The Legend of Zelda, Pokemon, Super Mario Bros and Donkey Kong.\\n The excellent thing about being a company so full of intellectual property is that it can be protected for long periods of time. Japan, the home of Nintendo, has strict copyright laws which protect works for 50 years after the death of the author. Many of the titles published by Nintendo today are simply more advanced versions of the earliest games it published during the 1980s. The basic format of the Donkey Kong games, for example, has not changed between the first game, in 1981, and the latest release in 2014. Both involve a large monkey jumping to avoid enemies and collect power-ups. It\\'s clearly a simple format, but one that has earned Nintendo millions of dollars over the last 37 years. There\\'s no reason to think that Nintendo will need to change this simple and cost-effective \"remixing\" recipe over the next few decades - especially as it has historically been a popular and successful strategy. A High Quality Product In addition to having a library of characters, music and ideas which can be employed again and again, Nintendo has also been consistently shown to offer a high quality product in the form of the games which it publishes. Its games are consistently ranked among the best by both critics and players. Breath of the Wild, Nintendo\\'s most recent installment in The Legend of Zelda Series, has sold 10.28 million units. Super Mario Odyssey, another title (part of a series which has been running since 1985) has sold 12.17 million units. This is principally because of the attention to detail which is embedded in both the culture of the company and the games they develop. For example, it\\'s not uncommon for game music to be completely rewritten if it doesn\\'t fit the mood of the game quite closely enough. Strong Fundamentals The company\\'s stock also has incredibly strong fundamentals, especially compared with the other giants of the industry. A P/E Ratio of 21.85x is a relatively low PE ratio in this period of high market valuations. It\\'s an even more attractive when you consider it alongside other game development companies. Activision Blizzard (ATVI) has a P/E ratio of more than 59x! Nintendo\\'s balance sheet also reflects the fact that it has a large quantity of cash and very little debt - an enormous positive in such a debt-heavy economic environment.\\n The company also pays a healthy dividend, currently at a 1.75% yield (for the ADR). This has steadily risen over time. \\n\\nNTDOY Dividend Yield (NYSE:TTM) data by YCharts Emerging Market Opportunities When considering whether to invest in a video game development company and console manufacturer, one must certainly also ask what the direction is for the general industry. The largest game developers (Nintendo is one of these) have an advantage when moving into new markets and can very easily form a monopoly in the markets they serve. This is because game development is very labour intensive and is a market in which only the highest quality products win. The only way to achieve these high standards is through having teams of developers working for hours on end to perfect the games being offered. Globally, video games are certainly popular in the West and in Japan. Places like China, South America and Africa, with growing numbers of middle class families are an excellent opportunity for Nintendo to expand its market. For this reason, investors certainly shouldn\\'t expect any slowdown in growth in the years to come. Widely speaking, we are a society moving towards having more free time as automation and artificial intelligence take away a large proportion of the jobs currently done by humans. Video gaming certainly would appear to be an obvious place where more of us will begin to spend a proportion of the free time that we gain, and Nintendo is well-positioned to take up this free time with the software it will be publishing. This is clearly a very long term perspective - so for the biggest gains Nintendo needs to be optimally held for perhaps 10 years or more. Challenges I certainly shouldn\\'t pretend that there are no threats to Nintendo. The company\\'s success (as I see it) is very much dependent on Nintendo going down the path it is currently on. This consists of remixing old franchises and assets and combining them with evolving technologies. Research and development should be focussed on improving the playing experience rather than introducing completely new types of games. ARMS, a completely new Nintendo-developed boxing game, performed badly (selling just over two million copies) in comparison to the top three reliable series-based games developed for the Switch (selling over 33 million units).\\n Nintendo has a great recipe for success and shouldn\\'t confuse itself by changing direction by making acquisitions or changing its development style. If this happens, it might be time to reconsider your position in the company. Conclusion Investor sentiment at the moment is clearly very negative. An analysis of where the market seems to be heading in the short term suggests at least some degree of further decline in stock prices globally. Nonetheless, Nintendo is an incredible company in terms of long-term potential if it follows its classic game development recipe. Dollar-cost averaging yourself into a position in this Japanese gaming giant would be an excellent idea if you are a long-term focussed investor.\\nDisclosure: I/we have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

Canada is unique in that certain companies in certain sectors have worked their way to an oligopoly situation - protected from competition. They are protected by regulations, the Canadian preference and incredible barriers to entry. While this still does not guarantee business success, I feel and hope that it will allow for continued business health, making for continued generous and growing dividends. Here\\'s the intro to The Dividend Growth Wide Moat 7 From Canada. The Wide Moat 7 represents just 3 sectors. That said, it \"covers\" one of the most influential sectors in Canada, the financials, plus the consumer by way of the telcos and energy by way of pipeline/energy names.  The original 7 companies are Roya Bank of Canada (RY), TD Bank (TD), Scotiabank (BNS), Enbridge (ENB), TransCanada Pipelines (TRP), Bell Canada (BCE) and Telus (TU).  I recently added Number 8 by way of Alimentation Couche-Tard (OTCPK:ANCUF) here\\'s that article The Canadian Wide Moat 7 Dividend Growth Portfolio - Making It A Perfect 10.  To bring the number of companies up to that magic number 10 are the two railways Canadian National Railway (CNI) and Canadian Pacific Railway (CP).  We now have the Canadian Wide Moat 10. Phew, that was easy.  The railways have that obvious wide moat. They simply already move the vast majority of products across the Canada and also around North America. Who is going to build a competing railway line beside an existing line? Good luck with that. The Motley Fool Canada describes the moat for Canadian National Railway. We also have those regulators \\'on our side\\' just as they help our banks and telco\\'s. \\n \\n\\nOnce again, I am a simple investor who looks for simple themes. I then go check to see that any theme has been working out financially. Is the company making lots of monies? Do we have increasing revenues, profits, cashflow, dividends? We don\\'t know the future but we can see how things have worked in the past and how the company or companies navigated through the rough waters and market corrections.  From Morningstar here are the key stats for Canadian National.  \\n\\nWe see the key metrics moving in the right direction; we see very nice behaviour through the last recession. There is an impressive dividend growth history. That said, just as with Couche-Tard, these railways to not deliver the big dividends. What they offer is a nice consistent growth history and that wide moat - more of a scalable business model with Couch-Tard.  Canadian National sits in rarified dividend growth history territory for a Canadian company. This thanks to Dividend Growth Investing and Retirement.  \\n\\n Here are the key stats for Canadian Pacific.  \\n\\nOnce again, we have the metrics moving in the right direction. The dividends are a little lumpy, with no consistent annual increases, but the dividend growth over the last decade is impressive. \\n If you Google for comparison opinions between Canadian National and Canadian Pacific you will usually see National come out ahead, or as the \\'choice\\' for a Canadian railway. As we obviously don\\'t know the future, it\\'s perhaps wise to include both and obtain that railway duopoly situation.  The past performance of the two Canadian railways is more than impressive. Of course past performance does not guarantee future returns. Courtesy of portfoliovisualizer.com here is CNI and CP vs the TSX 60 from the available time frame. The time period is September of 2001 to end of November 2018.  Portfolio 1 is Canadian National Railway Portfolio 2 is Canadian Pacific Railway \\n\\n\\n\\nYes, that\\'s an incredible market beat. Yes I wish I\\'d thought of this sooner, ha. The beat is present even over the last 3-4 years.  As I have penned on many occasions, investment success appears to come down to limiting your \\'mistakes\\' or limiting the amount of trouble that your companies \\'get into\\'. That\\'s why I think the future might be more in the hands of the smart beta funds that can easily seek out lesser risk and the potential of failure.  So what happens if we put the new additions into the Wide Moat Portfolio and run them through the last recession? Portfolio 1 is The Canadian Wide Moat 10. That in an incredible growth story now with an added boost.   \\n\\n\\n\\nAnd compared to the original Wide Moat 7. \\n Portfolio 1 is The Canadian Wide Moat 10 Portfolio 2 is The Canadian Wide Moat 7.  \\n\\nWe see a very nice total returns boost by way of the 3 additions to make The Wide Moat 10. But I am surprised to see that the drawdown was still lesser with the Wide Moat 7, and the Standard deviation is also less. That original 7 is hard to beat for stability.  Of course keep in mind that survivorship bias is at play here. We certainly would not gravitate toward a Couche-Tard or the railways had they run into business failure or extreme business hardship over the last several years. That said, one could argue that based on business success the wide moats are greater today then they would have been several years ago.  For my personal portfolio, I would love to add those 2 railways and Couche-Tard. But given my new life work stage and the need for income from my portfolio I am certainly drawn to the big juicy dividends of the Wide Moat 7. Once again, I will have to remind myself that greater income comes from greater business success over the longer term. If risks are managed, it does not matter is we use cash dividends or a combination of cash dividends and homemade dividends by way of share harvesting. We have to follow the math, not the cozy emotional attachment that we can have with our dividend payers.  But here\\'s a surprising look at the dividend income history, with dividend reinvestment. Due to some incredible dividend growth, the Wide Moat 10 would have caught the Wide Moat 7 for the period from 2007. The 3 new additions can deliver 100% greater dividend payments over 4 to 5 year periods for the period show, with dividend reinvestment.  \\n\\nThe Wide Moat 10 is still an impressive Dividend Growth Portfolio with respect to income and income growth. The total returns might receive a boost. And of course we have some additional diversification. \\n Thanks again for your help and suggestions. Please feel free to add more suggestions in the comment section. I\\'ll be back with 11-15. My readers tell me that Canadian Utilities are conspicuously absent. They might make an appearance.

The REIT earns approximately one-third of sales from western and northern Europe. The company also provides asset management services and real estate financing. Though only a public company since 1998, W.P. Carey has been in business for 45 years. The REIT has 1,186 properties leased to 304 tenants that covers 133 million square feet of space. W.P. Carey has a current market cap of $11 billion and produced $785 million in revenue last year. W.P. Carey announced on June 18th of this year that it would be purchasing Corporate Property Associates 17, or CPA:17, for $5.9 billion in a stock-for-stock deal. The deal had been expected to close by the end of 2018, but instead closed during the most recent quarter.\\n Recent Financial Results W.P. Carey reported financial results for the third quarter on November 2nd. Funds from operation, or FFO, totaled $1.48 during the quarter, beating the average estimate by $0.23. This was an 8% increase from the previous year. Revenue declined 0.7% to $209.4 million. Breaking down results by business segment, Real Estate produced adjusted FFO of $1.12 per share. Net revenues for Real Estate increased 1.3% to $173.4 million due to rent escalators and new acquisitions. This was partially offset by the selling of a hotel property in the second quarter of 2018. Occupancy rate for this division was 98.7%, or 98.3% including CPA:17. Weighted average lease term improved to 10.2 years, or an average of 10.5 years with CPA:17. The Investment Management division generated adjusted FFO of $0.36. Net revenues declined 14.3% to $24 million. The completion of the CPA:17 acquisition caused W.P. Carey to lower its FFO forecast for 2018 to a midpoint of $5.39 from $5.45 previously due to costs associated with the purchase. The cap rate, the ratio of net income to property asset value, is 7% for CPA:17. REITs like W.P. Carey purchase new properties in order to help grow their business. These acquisitions are often funded by debt. In a rising interest environment, financing this debt can become expensive. W.P. Carey has $4.4 billion in total debt, but a little more than a quarter of this is due over the next five years. Fortunately, W.P. Carey has built in rent escalators that can help pay interest on its debt. \\n\\n Source: W.P. Carey’s 2017 Annual Report. Two-thirds of W.P. Carey's lease agreements are tied to the Consumer Price Index, or CPI. As inflation increases, so will the rent on the REIT’s properties tied to this index. While debt levels are high, they are not exorbitantly so, which means the REIT’s dividend is likely to avoid being cut to help pay back what W.P. Carey owes.\\n Dividend History W.P. Carey has increased its dividend for the past 21 years, giving the company one of the longest dividend growth streaks in the REIT sector. In fact, only seven other REITs can claim a longer dividend growth streak. The U.S. Dividend Champions says that W.P. Carey’s dividend survived two recessions. While past success is not indicative of future success, this does show me that the company was able to increase its dividend through several swings in the economy. \\n\\n Source: W.P. Carey’s Investor Relations Website. W.P. Carey has increased its dividend:  By an average of 3.6% per year over the past three years. By an average of 11.4% per year over the past five years. By an average of 8% per year over the past ten years.  As you can tell from the annual averages, dividend growth has slowed in recent years. With a dividend yield of 6%, I am willing to trade some extra income for slower dividend growth. For comparison purposes, the S&P 500 has a yield of just 2.17%. W.P. Carey has paid a special dividend in the past, but not since 2014. W.P. Carey paid out $4.09 in dividends for 2018. This will equate to a payout ratio of 75.9% if the company achieves its midpoint guidance of $5.39. Like most REITs, W.P. Carey has a very high payout ratio. The five- and ten-year average payout ratios for W.P. Carey are 77.1% and 68.7%, respectively, so the current ratio is in the longer term range. While most companies typically follow a standard schedule of raising the dividend once per year, W.P. Carey tends to increase its dividend every quarter. The REIT has added a $0.005 to its dividend for the past eleven quarters, including a recent raise for the upcoming January 15th payment. The new annualized dividend is $4.12. If the REIT sticks to its half penny raise for each quarter, then the dividend will likely total $4.135 for 2019. This would represent dividend growth of 2.7% to 3.1% from 2018’s total. This projected growth is slightly below W.P. Carey’s three-year average rate.\\n My Valuation for W.P. Carey If you’re not familiar with how I value stocks, I take the current price and compare it to fair values and price targets from a number of different sources to see how over or undervalued shares are currently. I then take the average of these values to determine a price target.   Current Yield Years of Div Growth 5-Year Div Growth   6.02% 21 11.40%   Thomson Reuters Current P/FFO 5 Year Avg P/FFO   $69 12.7 12.7   Value Line Safety and Fin Strength Value Engine Fair Value Value Engine 1 Yr Price Target   2 / B+ $71.87 $65.27       My Price Target       Under $68.60   Value Line awards W.P. Carey a 2 for safety and a B+ for financial strength. I am looking for at least a 2 for safety and a B++ for financial strength as this gives me confidence in the company’s financial position. W.P. Carey’s safety rating satisfies my criteria, but falls a notch short on financial strength. This is not necessarily a deal breaker for me, but I would only purchase shares of the REIT if they are trading at least at my fair value. Shares of W.P. Carey closed Friday at $68.40. Using the REIT’s midpoint for guidance for 2018, the stock trades with a price-to-funds-from-operation ratio, or P/FFO, of 12.7 currently. This equals on the dot the stock’s five-year average P/FFO. The S&P 500 has a price-to-earnings multiple of 18.5. Value Engine has a one-year price target of $71.87, which would offer a return of 5.07% from current levels. Value Engine’s fair value for W.P. Carey is $65.27, showing shares to be trading at a 4.58% premium to their fair value estimate. CFRA and Morningstar, two of my usual sources, don’t offer a price target or fair value estimate for W.P. Carey. Instead, I used Thomson Reuters for an additional data point. Reuters has a one-year price target of $68.80, less than a tenth of a percent above the most recent closing price. Average these values out and I find that shares of W.P. Carey are just 0.29% undervalued at the moment. Conclusion W.P. Carey had a mixed quarter, but was able to grow funds-from-operations by 8%. At 98%, the REIT has a very high occupancy rate and the acquisition of CPA:17 offers a compelling cap rate. Like other REITs, W.P. Carey has a fairly high debt level, but only about a quarter of it comes due over the next five years.\\n W.P. Carey offers a very generous yield, even if dividend growth has declined in recent years. The current yield is almost triple that of the market index. The stock has also held up this year, losing just 0.70% while the S&P 500’s total return is a loss of nearly 8% for 2018. The yield plus the better performance versus the market index make W.P. Carey very attractive to me. Given the company’s B+ financial strength rating, I need shares to trade at least at fair value before purchasing. My sources give me a fair value of $68.60. Any price below this amount and I would be a buyer of W.P. Carey. What are your thoughts on W.P. Carey? Is there a REIT you prefer? Feel free to leave a comment below.

Let\\'s look at recent results, Del Frisco\\'s activist, and see why I am not buying the stock at current levels. Q3: Emblematic of the Issues at Del Frisco\\'s The issues at Del Frisco\\'s run deep across multiple segments. Revenue for the quarter was up 74% y/y to $105 million, driven largely by the acquisition of Barteca. Comps demonstrate the true underlying trend of the business. Comp sales were down 1.9% y/y during the quarter with a 5.5% decline in guest count offset by a 3.6% increase in average check size. Excluding Barteca, which should not be included in comps anyways, comps were down 1.6% y/y driven by a 7.5% decline in guest count offset by a 5.9% increase in average check size. Ultimately, the core Del Frisco\\'s businesses continue to lack customer traffic. Double Eagle performed the worst of the outlets with 2.4% decline in comps driven by a 4.7% drop in customer counts and a 2.3% increase in average check size. The company claims that the business is relatively healthy outside of the Chicago restaurant, which is closing, claiming average unit value of $14.6 million and a 26% EBITDA margin over the trailing twelve months. Chicago alone drove 0.3% of the comp decline, though the numbers clearly demonstrate that the concept, in general, is struggling. I question Del Frisco\\'s ability to identify attractive markets and adapt to local market needs. I suspect that the New York City location continues to obscure the performance of the broader business and that the Double Eagle concept lacks steam outside of its primary location. Overall, EBITDA margin was down nearly 280 basis points y/y to 22.4% of sales.\\n In addition to Double Eagle, Grille was relatively weak in the quarter. Total revenue was up nearly 6% y/y to $27 million driven by 13 additional operating weeks. Comps were down just 0.4% y/y during the quarter; with a 9% decline in customer count offset by an 8.6% increase in average check. Management provided some color on the performance, noting that wine sales were up 54% y/y to 9.3% of total Grille sales. I would assume the large drop in guest count is leading to slower table turnover, and perhaps patrons feel more comfortable ordering extra bottles of wine. Still, though the mix shift was impressive, Grille experienced 70 basis points of restaurant-level EBITDA margin deleverage to 12.2% of sales. The company will need comps to turn margin trajectory positive. Perhaps the most disappointing part of the quarter was the performance of the newly acquired Barcelona and bartaco concepts. Barcelona comps were up just 2.5% y/y, while bartaco comps actually declined 7% y/y during Q3. Management blamed it on a \"one-time incident\" at the Port Chester, New York location where a food handler exposed customers to Hepatitis A. Occasionally, terrible mistakes like this do occur. However, recall that Del Frisco\\'s paid over 10x EBITDA for this business. At such a rich multiple, I would expect rapid growth and near flawless execution. Instead, the company has had to close multiple locations and deal with a tremendous headwind that undoubtedly shakes confidence in the brand. Concurrently, Del Frisco\\'s divested Sullivan\\'s steakhouse for roughly 3x EBITDA to Romano\\'s Macaroni Grill. At such a low multiple, I would typically say such a transaction was barely worthwhile. In the case of Del Frisco\\'s, the company needed to divest to deleverage. So, in short, Del Frisco\\'s sold a flawed asset for 3x EBITDA to help buy a flawed asset at 10x EBITDA. Value destruction at its finest. An Activist and a Poison Pill Engaged Capital has taken a 9.9% stake in Del Frisco\\'s, which responded by creating a poison pill to prevent the fund from taking on a greater position. Engaged Capital believes the company is worth far more than it is today. Management placated Engaged by creating a strategic review with Piper Jaffray serving as the financial advisor and Kirkland & Ellis engaged as the legal advisor.\\n I would understand Engaged Capital\\'s viewpoint if Del Frisco\\'s were debt-free, which would imply a current valuation of ~ $230 million. However, Del Frisco\\'s is highly levered, and an enterprise value of $522 million today means that the company trades at ~5-6x EBITDA. This is not materially different from Red Robin (RRGB) (~4-5X EBITDA), Brinker (EAT) (7-8x EBITDA), or Cheese Cake Factory (CAKE) (7-8x EBITDA). All of these companies are larger with arguably better business models. I simply do not see where the sum of the parts is greater than the whole, especially with most concepts comping down. As a result of its lack of undervaluation relative to peers, I see no reason to enter a position at current levels. I think the company is overleveraged, and I fear comps will decelerate in the event of any greater economic slowdown. Del Frisco\\'s management team has not demonstrated the ability to create value, and I believe the share price accurately reflects the risks associated with the company.\\nDisclosure: I/we have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

At close on Monday, December 24, Agenus had a stock price of $2.22 and market capitalization of $266 million. I believe the disparity between these two figures is driven by fears in the markets in general, and a relative absence of small cap biotech investment at this time. A large gain could be made on Agenus stock if the situation normalizes. However, investors should study the deal carefully, as it includes no guarantees beyond the initial cash payment. Agenus has long been a leading investigator of immune system therapies, but to date has only one commercialization success. That is for a component it licenses to GSK (GSK) for its shingles vaccine. Therapy and Deal The financial basics of the deal were covered in a press release on December 20: Gilead And Agenus Enter into Collaboration to Develop Immuno-Oncology Therapies. Agenus CEO Garo Armen elaborated on the therapies and deal in a webcast conference with analysts. The main therapy in the collaboration is AGEN1423, a bispecific antibody that targets cancer resistance pathways with added TME (tumor micro-environment) conditioning. The unnamed pathways are associated with poor responses to checkpoint blockades across many tumor types. The IND to get FDA permission to a begin first-in-human trial is expected to be filed in the next few days. Gilead also received the right to option AGEN1223 and/or AGEN2373. The former is a bispecific antibody with immunosuppressive regulatory T cell depletion characteristics. The later is a CD137 signaling booster that enhances immune responses to cancer cells. CD137 boosts both innate and adaptive immunity, making it a highly attractive target for cancer immunotherapy. AGEN2373 is also expected to minimize toxicity outside the tumor site.\\n Agenus has the right to shared development and commercialization in the U.S. for its choice of one of the optioned drugs. Gilead will also have first negotiation rights to option two undisclosed programs. Upon closing of the deal Agenus will receive $120 million in an upfront payment and a $30 million equity investment. The equity investment is at a premium to the stock price. Beyond that future fees and milestones could total $1.7 billion. $37.5 million of milestones are near-term, the majority in 2019. No mention was made of royalties upon commercialization. Further details would have to be disclosed by Gilead. But Agenus did say some of the milestones are related to relatively early clinical readouts, as well as to the potential optioning of the two additional therapies. Valuation of the Deal Some clinical trials succeed, and some fail. My personal take is that Gilead would not pay this much upfront unless they believed, based on pre-clinical data, that at least the Phase 1 trial has a high chance of success. So valuation for the deal comes down to the question of how much the valuator wants to discount for potential failure. It is not unreasonable to argue that the deal is worth $150 million until further milestone announcements are made. An optimist could argue that the deal is worth $1.85 billion unless negative results are announced. Pick your point on the spectrum. I would argue that 50% is as reasonable as any other point, so I'll value the deal at $925 million until more data comes in. Keeping in mind most of this is chickens that may hatch, or may not. Keep in mind that most cancer therapy development timelines are years long. The specific cancer targets have not been announced, but typically Phase 1 could take years; Phase 2 and Phase 3 could take two years each or even longer. Rest of Pipeline Agenus already had collaborations before the Gilead deal, as well as pipeline products it owns and its commercial product QS-21 Stimulon, as shown at the Agenus pipeline page, reproduced here:\\n \\n\\n The biggest collaboration is with Incyte (INCY) on four cancer immunotherapies, which are ongoing. The Incyte deal generated a $5 million payment for initiating the Phase 1 trial of the LAG-3 antibody this September. Agenus is eligible to receive up to $505 million in future milestone payments from its Incyte programs, plus royalties if any of the programs reaches the commercial stage. Merck (MRK) is also developing an undisclosed therapy created by Agenus, which generated a $4 million milestone payment when the Phase 1 trial was initiated in August 2018. Cash and expenses Under the Gilead deal Agenus will be relieved of most development expenses for AGEN1423 and other therapies that are optioned, but I do not expect to see any substantial decrease in expenses. In Q3 2018 operating expenses were $39 million, so call it an approximately $160 million per year run rate. Cash at the end of Q3 was $46 million, which was getting low. Even with the new Gilead cash, the total will only be $206 minus the run rate, so figure about $212 for the end of Q4. Agenus will need to make more deals or hit more milestones before the end of 2019 to keep a positive cash balance. There is also a $187 million loan (end of Q3) that was an advance for Shingrix royalties. However, since the Shingrix vaccine for shingles is selling well, I expect royalties to pay off the loan and then some. Conclusion I am valuing Agenus at a market capitalization of $1.225 billion, or about $10 per share. I admit that is a very future events dependent figure. I arrived at it by adding my discounted value for the Gilead deal, $925 million, plus $250 million for the Incyte deal, and $50 million for the Merck deal. If all the drugs pass all their clinical trials and proceed to commercialization Agenus would be worth a great deal more. If any of Agenus's five wholly-owned checkpoint antibodies in the pipeline pass Phase 3 and go on to commercialization, it should be worth considerably more.\\n If every single therapy fails, Agenus could become worth essentially zero. I see that as an unlikely scenario. Note that since recent market capitalization values the company at just $266 million, it is currently undervalued under a wide range of scenarios. I encourage potential investors to look at the collaborations and pipeline data. I am encouraged that three major cancer companies are now collaborating on the Agenus cancer therapy pipeline. Expect more novel drugs to be announced as well. Since Agenus is a relatively unknown company, in the short run its stock price will most likely depend on whether it is highlighted by the larger brokerage houses as a worthwhile investment. Look for analyst upgrades to drive that, or not.\\nDisclosure: I am/we are long AGEN, GILD. I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions.

The bull/bear argument has essentially been “its different this time,” vs. “it’s not different this time and it never will be.” The first thing I’d like to say is that neither side has been proven right as of yet, and neither side will be proven right until we are through the next downcycle, which we seem to be entering. In addition, every cycle is both different and similar in certain respects. For this cycle, I think the memory industry is different enough to matter – a lot. No one ever said the memory industry was not cyclical anymore – again, no one every said the memory industry was not cyclical anymore (contrary to what many bears are now gloating) - only that the cycles will be more muted, and will happen at a higher level of profitability. If you think of a line graph “wave,” my interpretation that the wave shape in results will still be there, but at a higher level, and the wave itself will be upward sloping. \\n\\n  Source: Micron Analyst Day 2017 Bears might say, “well what about FY 2016?! Just three years ago Micron earnings went negative!” That\\'s true – however, it was the only year in the past six years that this occurred, and the company is now in a far different position – both financially and operationally – than a mere three years ago.\\n \\n\\n Source: Micron annual reports. Chart by author. Going back to 2013, when Micron\\'s EPS turned positive for good (except 2016) - what happened at that time that caused Micron to become profitable nearly every year? Consolidation: \\n\\n Source: McKinsey The fly in the ointment of the consolidation thesis was 2016, which was the only year in the past six that Micron’s EPS actually went negative (though 2016 was a \"higher low\" than the previous downturn in 2012). Micron management has outlined that it has made $6 billion in cost improvements since that time, with another $3 billion by 2021 on the way. Still, the market appears to not believe these figures, otherwise the market cap wouldn’t be a mere $32.5 billion (under book value!). Taking our time machine back to the year 2016, there are several ways in which the company is in far better shape, and let’s also peak at what exactly happened that year. Acquisition of Inotera  Back in fiscal 2016, Micron had agreed to acquire the rest of Inotera, a Taiwanese DRAM producer, in the last big consolidating move in the DRAM industry (after Micron’s acquisition of Elpida in 2013). That chart above from McKiney is actually deceptive, as Inotera (then called Infineon/Qimonda) was a joint venture between Micron and Nanya. Micron had owned 33% of the company prior to that time (acquired out of the 2009 Qimonda bankruptcy) but shelled out $4.1 billion for the remaining 67%.\\n Prior to the acquisition, Micron actually had an agreement to buy all of Inotera’s DRAM output and split the profits with Inotera. According to Anandtech, this actually accounted for about 35% of Micron’s DRAM bits sold. Since DRAM makes up about 70% of Micron’s business, this is a pretty significant hit to profitability, especially in a downcycle. Not only did Micron have to share profits, but Inotera actually was executing better than Micron on the leading-edge nodes at the time – it had transitioned to the 20 nm node faster than Micron had. So Micron had to split the most profitable tranche of DRAM bits at that time. This is why Micron’s margins were so much lower than the Samsung (OTC:SSNLF) and SK Hynix. Hynix achieved net margins of 17.1% in 2016. Overall net income was down 33% vs. 2015 and 37% lower than 2014. Source A similar 40% decline in Micron\\'s margins from its record highs last year would put trough EPS around $7, which is in line with most analyst forecasts for a trough year -- whether it be 2019 or 2020. Not only did Micron get the benefits of cost synergies typical of mergers, but Micron also gained Inotera’s technology expertise. In addition, Micron got Inotera’s capacity, which enables the company to be much more flexible in the development and production of different DRAM nodes. In addition to the cash flow and synergies, having Inotera consolidated allows Micron to more seamlessly allocate its resources to the product segments that make the company most efficient. It was far clunkier before. So this isn’t really cost or revenue synergies but basically boosts the reactiveness of Micron in response to market conditions. Per the Q4 2016 conference call: “The ownership of that asset and the ability to mix and match different technologies as well as potentially more value add products and capture that value is significant. …at the end of the day, it gives us the ability as well to take cash flow that’s going to be generated with Inotera and to put it across our network where we find that most useful.” (Per the Q4 2016 conference call)\\n At the time (prior to closing), management said that the acquisition would boost the company’s operating cash flow by $1.4 billion and FCF by $300 million to $600 million (and that’s given 2016 pricing numbers). (Per the Q4 2016 conference call) Delayed qualifications The other interesting aspect of the FT 2016 downturn was that, while pricing did crash, Micron also suffered from delayed qualifications of its latest products. Namely, the new LPDRAM and its first managed 3D NAND products for mobile phones. That actually limited yields in 2016, and pushed the bits shipped into 2017. You could argue that this caused 2016 to look worse than reality and 2017 to look a bit better merely due to this timing issue as bits got pushed to Q1 2017. The delayed customer qualifications were largely centered on mobile. Q3 2016 was a trough because of the significant conversion to 3D NAND which decreased/delayed shipments on new products while prices were decreasing. The recovery began in FY Q4 2016, but this wasn’t enough to bring gigabits sold in 2016 even to double digits: \\n\\n\\n\\n The PC crash of 2016 was likely due to Samsung accidentally flooding the market with PC DRAM. This was because of the SK Hynixfire in late 2013, which took supply off the market and sent PC DRAM prices higher. Samsung rushed to fill the void, but two years later they appeared to have overdone it. Addressing this, ex-Micron CEO Mark Durcan said on the Q2 2017 conference call:\\n “if you think about this cycle versus last cycle, what you saw - what you saw last cycle was a big chunk of supply come off with the Hynix fire and the reaction with more supply to replace it and so maybe a little less stability than we\\'re seeing this time around. So that\\'s all on the DRAM side. I don\\'t know why they would intentionally repeat the mistake from last cycle. They probably are enjoying making good margins. And our view is we just go out and we look at what information is available relative to all the various additions people are making and might be making and what the timeframe that might occur in and then we give you - you know, what we think that bit growth looks like. And that looks like it\\'s probably actually-- Samsung is actually probably on the low end over the next couple of years relative to what\\'s going on in the industry as a whole. And the industry as a whole is probably a little bit south of where we think demand growth is. So, could it (Samsung increasing supply and crashing prices) happen? Yes. Why would it happen? I can\\'t forecast that for you.” (Q2- 2017 conference call) This time around, there\\'s evidence that Samsung and SK Hynix are preemptively taking off supply, as both Samsung and SK Hynix began cutting back capex plans this summer, well before DRAM prices started going lower. Micron was actually the last to lower its capex plans. This is, reportedly, the first time these companies have done this preemptively before contract prices really started falling. Again, the crash in 2016 came largely because of PC weakness, which is a lower percentage of the company’s revenue today. In FQ3 2015, PC was roughly 30%-plus of DRAM revenue (Micron gets 70%-plus of its revenue from DRAM), but by FQ3 2017, it was a low 20% of DRAM. PC DRAM used to be 10 times bigger than server DRAM a decade ago, but now server (thanks to cloud computing) is twice as big than PCs. Balance sheet improvements Flash forward to today, and the company’s balance sheet looks almost the upside down version of what it was in 2016 and 2017. During the “boom” of the past few years, Micron has minted money and gone from a $5 billion net debt position in August 2016 to a $3 billion net cash position now.\\n \\n\\n In FY 2017, Micron paid a whopping ($570 million) in net interest expense (its operating income was actually positive) - an all-time high - while the company actually had net interest income last quarter of $5 million ($38 million income, $33 million in expense). Oh by the way, as short-term rates go up, Micron will earn more on this $7 billion cash pile, should the company choose to keep that much cash on the books. Obviously, with the share price having gone where it\\'s going, the company also could choose to return more to shareholders via stock repurchases. The way CFO David Zinser has it set up, the company is tying the liquidity on the balance sheet to revenue, so should revenue continue to come down, the company will spend less on capex and will not need as much liquidity. The capital allocation plan is slightly counter cyclical, as Zinsner has it set up that when revenue is rising the company should be building up liquidity, and when revenue is coming down (as it is now) the company can use it. I wouldn’t be surprised if the company returns more than 100% of free cash this quarter and next given the lower FY Q2 forecast. This is, obviously, a luxury the company didn’t really have back in 2016 when it was saddled with debt and interest payments. In fact, Moody’s upgraded Micron’s debt on Oct. 9, and S&P signaled a potential upgrade just last week. This is not exactly what you would normally associate with a crumbling stock price. Micron has closed the cost gap Finally, Micron’s execution in relation to its two main competitors in DRAM and the rest of the NAND market has really improved over the past three years. In 2013, the company had double the gross cost structure of Samsung on the leading edge. When everyone has to take the relative same price per bit, this really hurts. However, as you can see, Micron has narrowed the gap between itself and Samsung to less than 15% (and this was as of 2017 - it has likely moved even closer in 2018). That’s a very big difference. And Micron is now the cost leader in NAND, whereas it was behind in the 2015-2016 period.\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n High-value solutions In addition, the company has added to its product portfolio more high-value solutions such as integrated managed NAND for mobile phones as well as enterprise SSDs. These downstream products have a much higher margin than mere components. In the past quarter, the company’s NAND flash high-value solutions exceeded 50% of the company’s NAND output for the first time - a few years ago, only 20% of the company’s memory went into these high-value solutions. The company has a goal of increasing this to 80% over time, which also should help bolster profitability. This ain’t 2016  Going back to that rough time in Micron’s recent history, it’s pretty clear that at least, at the company level, things are significantly different. As for other factors, the macroeconomic picture is somewhat out of the company’s hands. That being said, this does appear to be similar to 2016 (a global growth scare) rather than a recession. The recent stock market selloff portends doom, even though economic data is showing robust growth next year (though lower than 2018 levels). But any macroeconomic weakness should be practically mitigated by the more diversified demand drivers beyond mobile phones and PCs. Now we have a much bigger cloud industry, the automated factory /IoT trend, and increasing memory content within automobiles (even if car sales stall or decline on a unit basis). In addition, the DRAM oligopoly is functioning as it should as it keeps supply more aligned with demand drivers – or at least better than in the past.\\n In theory, the better-functioning supply side and diversified demand drivers should make the current cycle a bit shorter than the past – we’ll see if that happens. Neither side has been proved as of yet.

To paraphrase Hemingway, there are two ways that investing profits can turn into losses: gradually, then suddenly. The latter profile applies to the latest adjustment in the S&P 500's current drawdown. As recently as early October, the US stock market's drawdown was measured in a few basis points. By the close of trading on Christmas Eve, the S&P's peak-to-trough decline crashed to just a hair under -20%. The market's reversal of fortunes appears to signal that a new bear market has arrived and so it's time once again to revive and renew the skill-set that invariably withers in bull markets - especially those of the long-running variety, such as the one that may have just died. By some accounts, the late, great bull was the longest since World War II. \\n\\n As for the future, the recent market volatility can play havoc on our ability to think clearly on matters of rebalancing, portfolio design, and updating expectations on risk and return. How, then, should we manage our outlook for equities? The true answer is multi-dimensional, covering an array of metrics and processes. We can start, however, by reviewing the S&P's one-year trend through history relative to drawdowns, if only as a baseline for deeper analytics. As a simple example, the chart below compares the S&P's 1-year performance following the drawdown from a year earlier. For example, the drawdown for Oct. 1, 1960 (x-axis) is compared with the trailing 1-year return through Oct. 1, 1961. A key takeaway in the chart: the relationship between current drawdown and the 1-year return a year down the road tends to be noise - until the drawdown approaches -40% and deeper. (Note: 1-year returns are defined using a 252-trading-day cycle.)\\n \\n\\n Once drawdowns reach -40% (and beyond), history shows that the 1-year performance of the S&P a year later is always positive, based on the track record over the past six decades. By contrast, the current drawdown (-19.8%), shown by the blue line, is just as likely to lead to a gain as it is a loss a year from now. (Technically, there's a slight bias for positive one-year return at the current drawdown, but practically speaking the average investor isn't likely to perceive that distinction.) None of this matters, of course, if your time horizon is substantially longer than a year. A 20% drop in the market from the previous peak (which implies a 20% rise in expected return over the long haul) looks considerably more attractive if you're running a strategy that can sit tight for a decade or more. By contrast, a 20% drawdown may disappoint if you're expecting a rebound gift by next Christmas. But if the pain continues, the odds rise sharply that a solid rebound is high-probability event in the short term. Nice, but that's still no free lunch. When (or if) the current drawdown sinks to -40% or more, your appetite will be low, perhaps nonexistent, for giving Mr. Market fresh capital to deploy. Such is the paradox of markets and behavioral risk: When the trailing performance is deep in the red, implying that the outlook is dark, the ex-ante return surges. By that point, there will only be a relatively small number of investors still capable (mentally and/or financially) of accepting Mr. Market's generous terms.\\n\"]}\n",

The transcript has been edited for clarity. Today\\'s episode is recorded on Christmas Eve after a recent market correction. No interview today, just my own personal thoughts and commentary. If you\\'re a seasoned investor and not worried about the market correction, this episode is not for you. However, if you\\'re not a full-time investor, and you\\'re worried or overwhelmed by the recent stock market decline, I think it\\'s crucial you listen to this podcast or read this transcript in order to cut through the emotional noise.   Transcript Hi, this is Eric Schleien and you are listening to The Intelligent Investing Podcast. Today, we are going to talk about the recent market correction. For those of you who consider themselves very experienced value investors who really aren\\'t worried about what\\'s going on -- this episode probably isn\\'t something for you. However, if you are someone listening who has either been a fan of the show or a new listener to the show and you have some concerns [regarding the recent market correction] or confusion about what\\'s going on, then this episode is definitely for you. I\\'m not going to be giving advice on this show or tell you what you should or shouldn\\'t do. Hopefully, I can give you some clarity so you can be empowered to make intelligent decisions on your own. So, let\\'s get started. For a little background, the Herald-Tribune posted an article on their website tonight titled: What does it mean when stocks enter a bear market? This is by Alex Veiga. He says that:  Wall Street\\'s sharp downturn beginning in October has pulled the Nasdaq composite index into what\\'s known as a bear market. The benchmark S&P 500 index is in what Wall Street calls a correction, and is headed toward a bear market, threatening to end the more than 9-year US bull market run. A correction is Wall Street\\'s term for an index like the S&P 500, the Dow Jones Industrial Average, or even an individual stock, that\\'s fallen 10 percent or more from a recent high. A bear market occurs when the index or stock falls 20 percent or more from the peak. Corrections are common during bull markets, and are seen as normal and even healthy. They allow markets to remove speculative froth after a big run-up and give investors a chance to buy stocks at lower prices. The S&P 500, Dow and Nasdaq entered a correction this month. The Nasdaq slid into a bear market Friday as a sell-off in Apple, Google\\'s parent Alphabet and other big names weighed on the technology heavy index. It\\'s the first year since World War II that the S&P 500 has had two corrections in the same calendar year. All told, the Dow fell 414.23 points Friday to 22,445.37. That\\'s 16.3 percent below its record close of 26,828.39 on October 3. The S&P 500 index slumped 50.84 points to 2,416.58. It\\'s now down 17.5 percent from its high of 2,930.75 on September 20. The Nasdaq tumbled 195.41 points to 6,332.99, or 21.9 percent below its peak of 8,109.69 on August 29. \\n So I\\'m not gonna read the rest of the article, but I wanted to delve into. One thing I\\'ll be discussing during this episode is whether the notion of holding cash is a good idea. One of the things is that any time one of these corrections happens is that you\\'ll have these talking heads come on CNBC and you\\'ll have these fund managers who are holding lots of cash, and they\\'re all gonna look like geniuses. The thing is though, most of these people were not holding cash every other time. So if you have a marketplace with millions and millions of participants, there\\'s going to be someone who held cash this time and then there\\'s going to be a smaller percentage of those people who also held cash during the previous recession. Those people are bound to exist statistically and are going to look brilliant. There are lots of people who are making economic predictions but if you\\'re going to make money from a macro thesis, you have to be right about a lot of things. So first of all, you actually have to be right about your thesis. So you have to say, \"Okay I think this will happen in the economy which then will cause the market to decline.\" So you have to be right about that. On top of that, not only do you have to be right about the actual events which you believe will happen but you also have to be right about what kind of assets that are going to make you money. Here\\'s an example. Ten years ago, there were a lot of people, including myself, who were worried about the Federal Reserve continuing to print lots of money. One of the ways that people played that was through the purchasing of commodity companies and gold mining stocks while selling off a lot of wonderful companies. Many of those people are still in that trade from ten years ago, and, they might be celebrating right now because the market had a 20% correction. However, they\\'ve also missed on the growth from 2008 all the way up to 2018. Corporate profits are up quite a bit since that so that is real intrinsic value growth over the past ten years that some of those people have missed out on because they were perma-bears who believe that there is always some kind of market crash that\\'s about to happen and occasionally they get it right. However, their portfolio track records tend to be pretty bad long-term.\\n So that\\'s the other thing. Not only do you have to be right about the macro-picture, you actually have to predict what\\'s going to work to make money off you being right about your prediction which is harder than it seems. The third part of this game is that you actually have to get in at the bottom. Everyone says they like to buy low and sell high, but typically what people do, is they sell low and buy high. I read a statistic that the average individual investor tends to only capture about 20% of the market return over an investment lifetime. That means if the stock market returns 10% a year over a lifetime, that average investor tends to make just 2% a year. That includes lots of day trading and lots of portfolio activity in general where you\\'re going to trigger lots of short-term capital gains taxes. Even if you\\'re going in and out of stocks every year and a half, that will still trigger a lot of capital gains taxes in regardless. On top of that, people tend to want to put in more cash at the worst time and then get out at the worst time. Right now there are going to be people liquidating their portfolios, selling off everything because they\\'re scared that there\\'s going to be another decline correction and decline in their portfolio values. And that might be the case. However, what it doesn\\'t take into account is asking themselves the question, \"what is the intrinsic value of the assets in my portfolio?\" Most people don\\'t have a clue. On the notion of holding cash, is it a good idea? I generally veer on the side of not holding cash and being fully invested unless there was really nothing to buy. However, if you\\'re someone who is either doing fundamental analysis and you\\'re dealing with a portfolio of under 100 million, you will probably find things to buy. You can do quite well being fully invested most of the time. There\\'s a friend of mine, Travis Wiedower, who has been on the show a bunch of times. Travis wrote a good article dated January 25th, 2018 on his blog, and it\\'s called, \"Is Holding Cash a Good Idea?\"\\n He says:  Over long enough time periods, the stock market has always performed well. There are plenty of bumps and bruises along the way, but the overall trend has always been up and to the right. In fact, the worst total return in history over a 20-year period was +54%. The worst 30-year return was +854%. We\\'ve all seen images like the one below that show this never-ending march up. Even when markets are high, as many people believe them to be now, the future expected returns from the stock market are still positive. I think this is an important distinction because I\\'ve talked to many people who think that because the market is high a crash must be inevitable and thus future returns will be negative. If the market is in fact too high right now [which we won\\'t know for another 5-10 years when we can look back], that means that future returns will be lower than historical averages--but not negative. Though I don\\'t put much value in people\\'s opinions who try to estimate future stock market returns, almost all of the estimates I\\'ve seen are in the low to mid-single digits--call it 4%. 4% isn\\'t great, but it\\'s a hell of a lot better than earning 0% in cash. If the above is true and the stock market always has a positive expected value, shouldn\\'t we always be 100% invested? The usual reasons given from investors [myself included] to hold cash are: Cash is optionality. If the market tanks, holding cash allows us to be nimble and quickly take advantage of cheap stocks. There is nothing cheap to invest in [definitely been here before, like, right now for example]. Behavioral / psychological reasons [peace of mind, etc]. The third one is very personal to each person\\'s situation and mindset, but I\\'m not sure the first two hold up to scrutiny. If the broad market is a bet that wins more often than not and it\\'s a bet we can always make, then anytime we want to own cash, shouldn\\'t we just own a broad stock market index fund like SPY (SPY) instead [SPY is an index fund that tracks the S&P 500]? On the first point from above, SPY might as well have the same optionality as cash because I can buy and sell it instantly [SPY\\'s average daily volume the past three months is over $20 billion dollars]. On the second point, even if there are no good individual stocks to invest in, a broad stock market index fund that has a positive expected value is better than cash at 0%. Whether conscious or subconscious, I feel like a lot of investors [again, myself included] actually hold cash as a way to time the market [even though none of us claim to do it, maybe some cognitive dissonance here] or because we manage other people\\'s money and are embarrassed to invest in an index fund [which makes sense, paying someone to invest in an index fund does sound pretty stupid]. But market timing and/or pressure from outside investors aren\\'t great reasons. I believe very, very few people can time the stock market consistently and thus the rest of us should probably just be 100% invested and benefit from the market\\'s inevitable march upwards over the long-term. If an investor averages a 10% cash position per year [which is low for a lot of investors] and the stock market returns 8% per year over the long-term, that investor is costing themselves 0.8% per year by not putting their cash into a broad market index fund. If the starting account value was $100,000 and 10% was in cash, that\\'d be $10,000 in cash to start. If the $10,000 is always invested in broad market index funds earning 8% on average, that $10,000 would grow to over $43,000 by year 20. If put in cash, that $10,000 would grow to exactly $10,000 by year 20. Okay, you\\'d probably get a little interest on the cash. If the cash was able to somehow earn 1% per year, it would grow to just over $12,000 by year 20. $43,000 vs $12,000 is a big difference! Missing out on 0.8% per year doesn\\'t sound like a big deal, but it can add up to a lot of money. I asked several money managers I talk to about their views on holding cash and got some quality input. I thought Fred Liu did a great job of describing the trade-off mathematically: \"The other way to think about it is yes, you\\'re giving up say 8% a year, with the trade-off that a recession / bear-market should bring it down [call it] 40%. With the assumption you can call a bottom [a big assumption], you\\'re basically assuming a bear market will come in the next 4.5 years, if you\\'re holding cash today. But note at the core, this is a market timing call.\" My take away is that for it to be mathematically correct to hold a meaningful cash position, one has to believe the market is going to have frequent and/or very deep downturns. The above also generously assumes the person invests their cash position near the market bottom, which we know isn\\'t usually the case. A lot of investors would actually have a bigger cash position at the bottom because the 40% drop they just experienced scared the shit out of them. I think an attitude of always being 100% invested can protect a lot of investors from these kinds of behaviors and cognitive biases that can hurt their long-term results. Of the money managers I talked to about this, every single one cited some sort of behavioral or psychological reason for wanting to hold cash. Samir Patel brought up an interesting point that I hadn\\'t considered myself: \"In theory you always want to swap the apparent 17% IRR for the apparent 21.6% IRR, but in practice I find that it\\'s usually hard to value things that precisely or anticipate when that value will be realized. As such, I find it hard to rob Peter to pay Paul - it\\'s easier for me to manage the portfolio when the decision to buy/sell one stock is mostly discrete from another [assuming no overlapping exposure, I.e., if I own FOGO, I don\\'t also want to buy a bunch of some other restaurant.].\" I think that makes a lot of sense. I\\'ve gone through that process many times where I\\'m 100% invested and want to add a new position. Then, I have to figure out what holdings to trim or sell completely to make room for that new position. That decision making process may very well be improved if those buy and sell decisions are completely discrete and not influenced by each other. Two other investors I talked to about this brought up holding Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.a) (BRK.b) as a placeholder for cash, but they also mentioned that selling Berkshire may be difficult to replace with another company [that isn\\'t run by arguably the best investor of all-time]. Thus, Berkshire in theory sounds like a good placeholder for cash, but it could easily turn into a normal position. My hunch is that owning SPY would not have that same psychological commitment, but maybe not. SPY is still a distinct position you have to sell to make room for something new. And if your SPY position it down, it may be difficult to sell thanks to how averse humans are to taking losses [loss aversion]. As I\\'ve been thinking about this concept the past few weeks, I went back and looked at some of my own purchases from the past year and three stood out. First, the big addition I made to my Franklin Covey (FC) position in mid-2017 that took my sizing from the low teens to the high-20s was when I had a big cash position. I wonder if I would have made that same addition if I was 100% invested and buying more Franklin Covey required me to sell other positions. I sure hope I would have if all I had to do was sell SPY, but I don\\'t know. The other two purchases that stood out were almost identical--Calloway\\'s Nursery (OTCPK:CLWY) put out great earnings after market close, so I put in buy orders immediately [because I had cash sitting around] and was able to get a small number of shares at the market open. I\\'ve made similar small additions to positions several times over the past couple years, but it\\'s only possible in micro-caps [where new information isn\\'t immediately reflected in the stock price] and when cash is sitting in the account. If I had all my \"cash\" invested in SPY, by the time I sold SPY and tried to buy CLWY at the market open I may not have gotten my shares--who knows. So if you invest in micro-caps, I think this is a very legitimate reason to have a small amount of cash sitting around [3-10% maybe? ], but those opportunities are never available in larger companies. Despite what the above sounds like, always being 100% invested isn\\'t yet an investment philosophy of mine [though I think the logic is sound so far]. I\\'ve held plenty of cash over the years, but whether or not that\\'s a smart thing to do is something I\\'ve been challenging myself on recently. \"Cash is optionality\" is one of those market truisms that almost everyone believes, but I\\'m not convinced it\\'s right in the long-term. I think \"liquidity is optionality\" is closer to the truth--and a lot of things other than cash are extremely liquid. My current thinking is: If the market always has a positive expected value, there\\'s no reason to ever hold a meaningful amount of cash [vs a broad, liquid index fund]. \"Far more money has been lost by investors preparing for corrections, or trying to anticipate corrections, than has been lost in corrections themselves.\" - Peter Lynch. \\n I think that\\'s very powerful. Now there\\'s a variant view out there. I got an email just the other day from a friend of mine, and I\\'m not going to say his name on the air, but I\\'m going to read you one of the emails he sent me just so you can get an idea of the thinking of people who do think they can market time, and are concerned about the economy. This is the email that I got two days ago on December 22nd at 1:56 AM. There are multiple asset bubbles and systemic risk within the banking system related to fraud and money laundering that will bring down everything [check the Panama Papers and look at Deutsche Bank and Goldman]. Corporate profits are meaningless with these systemic threats. The market, pensions, and home values will collapse which triggers lower consumer demand which affects all companies regardless of the strength of their underlying business fundamentals. This will be much much worse than 2008. That was just mortgages. This is also mortgages plus corporate debt plus student loans plus pensions plus sovereign debt, all in the context of trade wars, nationalism, and declining population in the EU, Japan, and the worst population growth in the US in 80 years. I completely pulled out of the market in May. I told the board of my company in January 2008 that we needed to sell the company because the economy was going to collapse in the fall... [t] hat was not a popular opinion at the time but it was 100% dead on. He goes on to say:  ... [I\\'ve] stressed pensions and Medicaid. This will turn out to be 100% accurate. The corporate profits we have had, have been fueled by $1 trillion in deficit spending. There is very little growth in the voluntary economy. The implosion of multiple asset bubbles + demographics + trade wars = complete meltdown. I have been discussing this publicly since May. Only now are people starting to take it seriously. Most people run on post World War II assumptions regarding the performance of the markets with the US as the hegemonic power. Far better to examine the last 6000 years of history. \\n So, basically, what he\\'s saying in a nutshell is that there\\'s a lot of terrible systemic issues going on in the world and this is going to lead to a complete meltdown with the implosion of some of these asset-bubbles, plus trade wars, plus negative demographic trends and that it\\'s a fallacy to look at the United States and look at the stock market with these post-World War II assumptions as the market just always goes up and that it will be a major power in the world. That\\'s his view. I responded to his email and said: I get all that, but I don\\'t get how the profits say of Google or See\\'s Candies [which is a Berkshire Hathaway sub] can be deemed meaningless. I think it\\'s incredibly unlikely that a company like Google won\\'t be making more money in 10 years. I don\\'t make the connection that all corporate profits are BS. He replies:  It doesn\\'t matter about over 10 years. The point is to buy low and sell high. I don\\'t believe that Google or See\\'s are immune to a massive financial collapse. The point is to buy the right things at the right time. Google is down 30% this year. I think it goes down another 25-50%. Why would I buy Google now, when I know that the things that are going to drive the market over the next 6-12 months will bring down Google with it? I have been telling people this for months, almost no one listen and they\\'ve all gotten rekt. We are nowhere near a bottom. I see no value in holding my money in assets whose value will be determined more by corrupt banks and politicians than on the merits of the performance.  So there are a few things about that. If you look at what determines values of an asset over time, it\\'s the intrinsic value of that underlying business. For instance, let\\'s say you make an investment in the bonds of a stable company such as Berkshire Hathaway or Johnson and Johnson. Say you purchase a 10-year corporate bond from one of these companies and you know the coupon rate on the principle of the bond. Let\\'s say the bond sells for 90-98% of par. You know how much will get paid out per year. Now let\\'s say there\\'s a financial collapse and the prices on these bonds decline by 40-50% and the bond has not been impaired. Now, your interest rate simply goes higher. The value of the bond is not being determined by a corrupt bank or a politician, because at the end of the day, as long as Johnson and Johnson can make that coupon payment, that\\'s what\\'s going determine the value of that bond [how wealthy you get in the end], and not what a trader is gonna do, even if that bond goes down even more. [This only matters if you are forced to sell the bond].\\n With a stock, these principles still apply. However, with a stock, you don\\'t have a coupon rate printed on the stock certificate, you have to get a sense of what that will be by figuring out some kind of range of the intrinsic value of that given security. It won\\'t be precise like a bond since you won\\'t be able to exactly predict the precise growth rates of free cash flow and corporate earnings for the next 20 years. I replied to that email and said:  I think this is where our fundamental understanding differs. The value of Google is all the cash flows it will ever produce discounted back to the present at a certain discount rate. That\\'s not an opinion -- that literally is what the intrinsic value is of a cash flow producing asset whether it be a stock, bond, farm, or buying a rental property down the street. The principle still applies. I\\'m not saying to buy or not buy Google now. However, for instance, there are some properties that I have ownership in that are publicly traded and are traded for about 60 cents on the dollar of their private market value. At the CURRENT price, I get paid a 10% yield on my cash just to sit there and wait without any kind of growth. If the market goes down and that security goes down along with it, I\\'ll be able to buy more at an even greater discount to the intrinsic value of those properties while the business can also buy back their own stock at higher and higher yields. To squabble over a 10,20,30% change in the price of a company when you believe the business to be significantly undervalued doesn\\'t make much sense and makes the game much harder. Sure, if you don\\'t believe Goldman\\'s book value or corporate earnings really exist than paying a discount to book with a high earnings yield when you believe they will have a much greater haircut in both book value and profits, and you don\\'t believe that\\'s the actual yield you\\'ll get on cash, then sure, I can understand that. Also, if you have a business that is below intrinsic value + has lots of liquidity + has intelligent capital allocation than in a scenario where there is a huge market decline and/or an actual macro headwind against the business such in the case you bring up, then that scenario will actually INCREASE owner\\'s earnings and INCREASE intrinsic value, not diminish it. You have to be right about both a market decline and then again timing the bottom. If you look at people with track records that go on for decades, it\\'s VERY VERY VERY hard to find people who have done this successfully over time. And usually those people who called something correctly like that are not able to replicate the call again, and/or their track records are miserable as they miss out on a 300% increase in the market over many years and then they get to be right about some kind of 50% market correction years down the line [which is bound to happen regardless]. So, not saying you\\'re wrong. I have no idea either way. What I\\'m saying is you can still be right about the economics and still not end up with a very good long-term personal investment track record over time. And you understand math. For compound interest to really take effect, you need to be thinking in decades... You can also be right economically but then not know how to take advantage of it. Say you thought the FED was gonna be printing lots of money and then you wrongly predicted hyperinflation years ago. Or maybe you see a rise in commodity prices but you buy gold miners whose equipment prices rise faster than the price of gold... All these variables that you have to be right about, pick the right security, and then actually time the bottom and the top. Is it possible to do all of that, yes... Sure... Maybe. To do that correctly consistently for a lifetime of investing, VERY HARD game. The latter is just a much easier game even with a knowing you\\'ll end up buying securities that may end up having corrections of 50% or more in a given year. I mean, hell, Charlie Munger was down something like 74% in the mid 1970\\'s and he still finished out the decaded outperforming the market by something like 7x. Berkshire has had corrections of 50% or more three times since 1965 and you still finished out 50 years with a return of over A MILLION PERCENT [this compares to a ~12,000 percent return for the S&P 500 during that time]. \\n He replies: Doesn\\'t answer at all whether you should sit on the sidelines now and re-enter after the collapse... So here is someone for an example where, yes, he\\'s right in the sense that you\\'d perform better if you re-enter only after the collapse. What he\\'s not saying is that you have to be correct about when a given collapse will hit bottom is and then actually have the guts to invest and not be run by fear. Usually, by the time the macro-picture clears up, you\\'ve already missed the bottom. If you need the cash in two or three years, it\\'s probably not appropriate to be buying stocks in the first place because you can have a correction of 50% or more in a given year. If you have a holding period, of say, five years and certainly ten years or more, you should not be worried about whether there is a correction or not. And quite frankly, if you\\'ve been speculating and you just lost a lot of money then what I\\'m about to say applies to you. First off, when I say speculating how I define speculating as buying an asset when you really don\\'t know what the underlying intrinsic value is. That\\'s fine by the way if you don\\'t know. The problem is that a lot of people will invest in a company because they think that a given company or industry has a great future. That\\'s nice, but is the market already factoring that great future into the price? And furthermore, you could have been right about the technology industry or the growth of the internet and still lost a lot of money in the \\'90s. Decades ago, you could have been right about semiconductors and lost a lot of money in semiconductor companies. Or a century ago, you could have been right about the automobile industry, yet the car companies you invested in went bankrupt or produced lousy returns over time. So if you were doing that before the correction, what you were doing was essentially gambling in the stock market. If you lost money doing that, then I would say to be grateful and let this be a lesson to you and actually feel the pain of losing a lot of money and have this be a wake-up call that if you choose to invest in any kind of asset, you should have some kind of understanding of what you believe the asset to be worth, and what you believe the asset will be worth in five or ten years down the line. And generally, if you can\\'t make analysis and can\\'t come up with a gauge for intrinsic value, then you either need to learn how to do that, find someone who does, or just buy an index fund and go to sleep for 50 years.\\n If you look at financial history, during every correction there\\'s some fear of something and sometimes it\\'s justified and sometimes it\\'s not justified. However, at the end of the day, what is going to impact securities prices is not a corrupt banker, a politician or a market manipulator or short seller. Politicians love to blame those kinds of external factors on market prices and find scapegoats. What\\'s going to move markets over time is that actual intrinsic value of an asset, whether it\\'s a bond, a company in liquidation, a piece of real estate or a rental property, a farm, or a stock. That\\'s really how you have to think about things and that\\'s all I have to say about that. If you have any questions for me, you can contact me at intelligentinvesting@gmail.com.

(AGEN) announced that it had entered into a partnership with Gilead Sciences (GILD) for an immuno-oncology (I-O) pipeline. This partnership will focus on the development and commercialization of up to 5 novel immuno-oncology therapies for Agenus' pipeline. I believe that this deal is very good for the biotech, especially since it was short on cash. It will have the ability to earn billions in potential milestones and to fund the rest of its expansive pipeline. Massive Partnership Deal The partnership deal signed between Agenus and Gilead Sciences is a huge deal. Not just on the basis of the necessity to gain cash, but on how much is up for grabs as well. For starters, Agenus will receive up to $150 million upon the closing of this deal. This will be separated into $120 million as an upfront cash payment, and then $30 million as an equity investment. This is a good amount of upfront cash to avoid dilution and fund other parts of the pipeline. If the clinical programs work out, then Agenus will also be eligible to receive up to $1.7 billion in fees and milestone payments. The upfront cash and the massive potential milestone payments are just one part of the equation. Agenus won't have to do much to advance the clinical product. It basically has to develop the product up to the option decision points. From there, Gilead can choose if it wants to accept the option to license the products. That means it will be responsible to fund the rest of the program from there afterwards. Agenus will have the right to opt-in if it chooses to receive shared development and commercialization costs for one of the options programs in the United States. Gilead comes out good on the deal as well, because it also will receive the right to have the first negotiation for two additional products in the preclinical stage of testing that have not yet been disclosed.\\n Advancement of Clinical Products The most notable item is that a majority of these programs are either in the IND planning stage or ready for an IND to be filed soon. For instance, the first product Gilead will receive worldwide exclusive access to is AGEN1423, which is expected to file an IND before the end of 2018. AGEN1423 is a bispecific (TME Conditioning) clinical product where bispecific antibodies are engineered to simultaneously bind two different antigens. Why is it important for this clinical compound to bind to that many antigens? That's because it gives an opportunity for the drug to stop tumor evasion of the immune system. Then Gilead still obtains an exclusive option to license two additional early-stage programs. The first of which is AGEN1223 which also utilizes simultaneous binding on two different antigens (bispecific antibody); however, it has a goal of depleting immunosuppressive T-regulatory cells (T-regs) from the tumor microenvironment. The ability to deplete T-regs is important, because they are responsible for knocking down the effectiveness of the patient's immune system. The biotech has already filed an IND to initiate the first clinical study for AGEN1223. The other drug AGEN2373 has an IND filing that is planned to be filed in the 1st half of 2019. This drug is a CD137 (f-1BB) positive regulator of the immune system. The key advantage of using this drug for cancer immunotherapy is the ability to be upregulated on both activated T-cells (adaptive immune cells) and natural killer cells (innate immune cells). Financials According to the 10-Q SEC filing, Agenus had $46.3 million in cash as of September 30, 2018. However, soon thereafter a single private investor, through a financing, offered up $39.9 million in cash. That also added a lot of cash into the company's coffers. The biotech believed that its cash would be enough to fund operations into the second quarter of 2019 roughly. With this new deal coming to light with Gilead, Agenus won't have to raise cash for quite some time now. That's because the upfront payment of $120 million and the equity investment of $30 million should allow it to fund operations for a few years without the need for a new cash infusion.\\n Conclusion Agenus is now an even more attractive small-cap biotech after this deal with Gilead Sciences. The upfront payment takes care of cash concerns, and puts emphasis on the bispecific antibodies pipeline. The ability to earn up to $1.7 billion in milestone payments is also a very important prospect. The risk is that this partnership tie up, with these immuno-oncology products, are in the very early stages of clinical testing. There is no guarantee that some or all of the studies will end up being successful. In the event that the products don't work out, Gilead has the option to not license any of them if it doesn't want to. That means if Gilead feels that the results are not up to its standards, it likely won't take the option to license any of the products. That would put any potential milestones in jeopardy. Still, this deal is good in that it gets the ball rolling for Agenus' pipeline, without the need to raise cash by other dilutive means.\\nThis article is published by Terry Chrisomalis, who runs the Biotech Analysis Central pharmaceutical service on Seeking Alpha Marketplace.

ADMS’s value is looking ripe and I’m ready to go picking. I take a look at the stock’s value.ADMS is down 75% for the year and falling into 2019. I take a look at the charts to determine if I add now or wait for a fresh calendar.'], 'article': ['Adamas Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (ADMS) has had a volatile 2018 experiencing all-time highs and lows. I recently published an article on Adamas reviewing the results of the company\\'s 3rd quarter earnings report and subsequent demolition of the share price. In that article, I categorized ADMS as a falling knife and recommended investors to wait for positive news or for the stock\\'s technicals to change before adding to or initiating a position. Although I still maintain that strategy, recent overall market performance has dragged the share price to an all-time low, and I am adding fundamental valuation to the overall buy thesis.  In addition, I review the company\\'s ongoing efforts to secure GOCOVRI as a lead player in the neurology drug market. A recently issued patent for Parkinson\\'s disease \"OFF\" may have provided investors some hints of another indication for GOCOVRI, or at least provided ammo against the company\\'s ongoing battle with Osmotica (OSMT). Additionally, I provide some existing research on amantadine in other potential indications.  \\n\\n Source Company Overview Adamas Pharmaceuticals, Inc. \"Adamas\" is a commercial stage pharmaceutical company that specializes in developing chrono-synchronous therapies for chronic neurologic disorders. The company’s portfolio (Figure 1) is focused around their principal drug GOCOVRI (ADS-5102).\\n\\n\\n Figure 1: ADAMAS Portfolio (Source ADMS) GOCOVRI received FDA approval back in August 2017, for levodopa-induced dyskinesia (LID) for Parkinson’s disease (PD) patients. GOCOVRI is the first and only approved drug for LID and has a secondary of improving “OFF\" times in PD. It is taken once daily at bedtime and is offered in extended-release capsules in 68.5 mg and 137 mg strength. \\n\\n Source GOCVORI is a reformulated generic amantadine and was allowed to exploit the FDA 505(2) (B) pathway to expedite the approval process. Yet, GOCOVRI is an extended-release (ER) amantadine formula, whereas, the generic formula is an immediate release (IR), and has been prescribed “off-label” for treating dyskinesia in PD patients. However, amantadine immediate release has had minimal impact moderating the symptoms of Dyskinesia. Using the glutamate pathway (Figure 2), GOCOVRI interacts with the glutamate receptor in the brain and is able to act concomitantly with levodopa without interfering. \\n\\n\\n\\n Figure 2: Glutamate Pathway with GOCOVRI (Source ADMS) Adamas has confidence that GOCOVRI is superior to generic amantadine in LID treatment because of the extended-release formulation. This permits the amantadine to be effective when it is most desirable; which is in the morning upon waking (Figure 3).\\n \\n\\n Figure 3: GOCOVRI vs Amantadine IR Time (Source ADMS) Expanding the Label In addition to LID, Adamas is working hard for a second indication for GOCOVRI; gait impairment in multiple sclerosis (MS) patients. The GOCOVRI–MS program completed its mid-stage study and displayed statistically significant improvements in walking speed after four weeks (Figure 4 & 5). \\n\\n Figure 4: GOCOVRI Walking Speed Improvement – 4 weeks (Source ADMS) \\n\\n Figure 5: GOCOVRI TUG Test Results 4 Weeks (Source ADMS) The company plans to run two Phase III studies, a pivotal efficacy and safety study, and an open-label safety study. Adamas anticipates a meeting with FDA about an sNDA if the results of the first pivotal Phase III study are positive. \\n\\n Figure 6: MS Program Structure (Source ADMS) Recently, Mylan (MYL) launched the generic form of Acorda’s (ACOR) AMPRYA ( dalfampridine); which is the only drug approved for walking impairment in MS patients. In clinical trials, AMPRYA was able to elicit a 25% (20% is clinically Relevant) average increase in walking speed in responders by 14 weeks. If ADS-5102 can demonstrate similar results, it might be able to take a piece of AMPRYA’s 2017 sales of $542M. If approved, Adamas forecasts commercial launch of ADS-5102 in 2022.\\n The Unknown Indication(s) Looking back at Figure 1, we can see that the company has plans for at least one more indication with GOCOVRI. In a recent conference presentation, CEO Greg Wentz hinted that the company is aiming to add a third indication in Q1 2019. My bet is on adding Parkinson’s OFF as a primary indication for GOCOVRI. Although it is on the GOCOVRI label, the company could easily add the indication without performing any additional trials due to the existing data from LID. CEO Greg Wentz recently mentioned it was “hard to choose” between picking LID or OFF for GOCOVRI. What is more, the company did just add the OFF patent for GOCOVRI’s IP. This would allow providers to prescribe GOCOVRI for OFF, and still ultimately treat for dyskinesia. This would help Adamas to tap into the patient population who has dyskinesia, but who don’t seek treatment for it. \\n\\n Source What are the other possible indications for GOCOVRI? According to Adamas, GOCVORI still has a long list of possible indications to help expand the label (Figure 7). \\n\\n Figure 7: Other Potential GOCOVRI Indications (Source ADMS) The indication list above is exceptional and could provide GOCOVRI exposure to markets with little competition. The motor disorder contains indications that are right up GOCOVRI’s alley. Since GOCOVRI has shown evidence to police the glutamate pathway, it could have potential in other motor/movement disorders that involve spasms or involuntary movements.\\n Tardive Dyskinesia Similar to Parkinson’s dyskinesia, tardive dyskinesia (TD) is a serious side effect that may occur with the prolonged use of certain medications used to treat an illness. In the case of TD, patients are being treated or were once treated with antipsychotics for an extended period of time. These antipsychotics could generate repetitive, jerking movements that occur in the face, neck, and tongue. Approximately one in four patients who are on long-term treatment with an antipsychotic will develop TD.  One study evaluated the effects of 100 mg of amantadine in tardive dyskinesia. The study comprised of 22 TD patients, in a double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover design. Patients were randomly assigned to be administered amantadine or placebo for 2 weeks followed by a washout period of 4 days. Next, the two groups were crossed over, and the procedure repeated. The primary efficacy endpoint was deviations in Abnormal Involuntary Movements Scale (AIMS) score, at baseline and at the end of the 2 weeks of treatment. The results displayed that amantadine patients averaged an AIMS reduction (improvement) of 21.81%; whereas placebo treatment, did not see any improvement from baseline. In addition, amantadine did not change any of the cognitive measurements in used in the Mini-Mental State Examination and Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale. The researchers came to the conclusion that amantadine may be an effective and safe treatment for TD. Huntington’s Chorea Huntington\\'s disease (HD) is characterized by chorea, cognitive and behavioral changes. Amantadine’s anti-dyskinetic effect on levodopa-induced dyskinesias, which are known to have similarities with choreic hyperkinesias. The anti-dyskinetic efficacy of amantadine and its effects on cognitive and behavioral symptoms were evaluated. In a study, 8 HD patients received 100 mg of amantadine 1-year period. The researchers found a significant reduction of dyskinesias and no changes were observed in neuropsychologic and psychiatric assessments after 6 and 12 months of therapy.\\n Tourette Syndrome Tourette syndrome is commonly treated with haloperidol, which over time, increases the chances of the patient developing Tourette tardive dyskinesia. In a crossover study, amantadine and benztropine were analyzed to treat the motor side-effects associated with the treatment of Tourette syndrome with neuroleptic agents. It was established that amantadine is a superior agent in treating the side effects of haloperidol treatment in Tourette syndrome. Depression In a recent review of published studies, researchers found that amantadine had “antidepressant-like effects in animal models and appeared to potentiate the antidepressant effects of other antidepressants.” In clinical trials, data displayed that amantadine may diminish depressive symptoms and improve the antidepressant effects of monoaminergic drugs. The researchers concluded that amantadine could be an interesting candidate as an antidepressant drug for the treatment of depression. When considering the indications above, it appears Adamas has a choice to either go after a broader indication such depression or continue to focus on specific indications like Huntington’s chorea. Either way, amantadine has already displayed some success in these indications and could provide significant clinical benefit in an extended-release formula such as GOCOVRI. OSMOLEX ER Continues to Put Pressure on GOCOVRI Back in February, Osmotica received FDA approval of their amantadine extended release drug OSMOLEX ER. Although OSMOLEX ER is not approved for LID in PD patients, it is approved for the treatment of Parkinson\\'s disease and drug-induced extrapyramidal reactions in adult patients. Subsequently, ADMS stock fell about 20% riding on the panic that OSMOLEX ER will obstruct GOCOVRI’s sales as a result of physicians prescribing “off-label.” \\n\\n\\n Source In my previous ADMS article, I defended GOCOVRI as the superior product compared to OSMOLEX ER. I pointed out GOCOVRI having a longer average peak amantadine plasma level time compared to OSMOLEX ER (12 hours vs. 7 hours), and the fact that OSMOLEX ER had previously failed as a LID drug. However, when we compare the plasma concentration charts below, we can see a similar pattern for OSMOLEX ER and GOCOVRI. Although GOCOVRI does have an edge in terms of performance, we must concede the chart is similar. Considering this, I have to acknowledge that neurologists might have their PD patients try OSMOLEX ER even though it failed a LID trial in 2016. \\n\\n\\n\\n Source Perhaps the biggest threat from OSOMLEX ER is that it is priced at WAC of $450/month; which would minimize the risk of being designated as a tier 5 drug. Adamas decided to price GOCOVRI at $28,500 annually or $2,375 per month, which is priced competitively compared to other branded neurological drugs (Figure 8), but now puts it way above OSMOLEX ER’s expected WAC.\\n\\n Figure 8: Neuro Drug Comparatives (Source ADMS) The OSMOLEX ER WAC price has to be a concern for management and investors. Payers could require patients to go through a step therapy program with OSMOLEX ER before moving onto GOCOVRI. This has been a common practice for payers for some time now. It is the payer’s way of forcing the most cost-effective treatment to be prescribed first. Only if that treatment fails, will the patient be allowed to progress to the more expensive therapy/drug. This is also known as a fail-first requirement and has been a controversial subject because the payer dictates the patient’s treatment more than the provider or the patient. With that big of a difference of price, I wouldn’t be surprised if payers implemented a step therapy program for LID.\\n What is more, Osmotica is not hiding the fact they are going after GOCOVRI’s sales. Diving deeper into their investor presentation, I find charts and statements that imply they are gunning for GOCOVRI. \\n\\n \\n\\n Source It is these actions that have caused Adamas to file litigation against Osmotica for infringing on the company’s intellectual property. On the Q3 earnings call, CEO Greg Went commented: “We have most recently asserted affirmative claims of infringement against OSMOTICA on nine separate patents seeking various forms of relief, including damages. We will continue to aggressively enforce and defend our IP for the benefit of patients and for the benefit of our shareholders.” I believe these recent developments have increased the potential volatility associated with the outcome of the lawsuit. If Adamas cannot leverage their IP against Osmotica, I expect further investor fallout. Upcoming Catalysts In addition to the new indications for GOCOVRI, the company has plans to introduce two new products to the pipeline. According to CEO Wentz, he has the R&D department at “full throttle,” and looking into new in-house products. Additionally, they are looking into potentially in-licensing fixable failed phase IIs products. Typically, I would not be pleased with paying for failed products, but Adamas’s ability to find maximize the potential in a product (ex. Amantadine) has provided me confidence the company will capitalize on other companies’ failures.\\n to the Q4 earnings report, the company has a few upcoming catalysts for investors to make note of. Most of these catalysts are the initiation of studies for ADS-5102 and ADS-4101. Although these are important events for the pipeline, I don’t expect them to be big price movers for the stock. \\n\\nFigure 5: Upcoming Milestones (Source Adamas) Another catalyst would be an update on the ongoing IP litigation with OSMT. Any announcement about progress in this predicament should create positive movement in the share price. Knife Still Falling In my previous Adamas article, I had a section titled “To Catch or Run?” where I classified ADMS as a falling knife after the Q3 earnings report, but also claimed that ADMS was worth the risk of trying to “catch” the bottom. In addition, I suggested the use of the Hull Moving Average (HMA) and the Relative Strength Index (RSI) to help mitigate the risk of being “cut.” Well, those indicators have saved me from a few gashes since that article. Looking at the weekly (Figure 9) and daily (Figure 10) charts, investors can see how we can still classify ADMS as a falling knife. Even though it showed some false support at the end of November, ADMS has followed the overall market as we approach the end of 2018. \\n\\n Figure 9: ADMS Weekly (Source Trendspider) \\n\\n\\n Figure 10: ADMS Daily (Source Trendspider) The share price has had an affinity for the lower downtrend line on the daily chart since the Q3 ER, and has just broken a long-term trend on the weekly. Based on the charts and indicators, I am still waiting to add to my position. On the other hand, the stock’s valuations and balance sheet are becoming hard to ignore (Figure 11 & 12). \\n\\n Figure 11: ADMS Valuations (Source Seeking Alpha) \\n\\n Figure 12: ADMS Balance Sheet Data (Source Seeking Alpha) I find the total cash per share of $7.71 to be very attractive at the moment because the share price is currently trading around $7.84 per share (12/21/18). Into the bargain, the company currently has a price to book ratio of 1.87, which is quite rare for a small cap biotech. Even though the company does have approximately $115M in debt, the fundamentals are improving with increasing revenue and limited competition. Conclusion Even with ADMS closing 2018 out at all-time lows, I am watching and waiting for the right time to add to my position. The Q3 earnings report fall out and persistent biotech sell-off has kept my finger off the trigger, but the company’s current market value keeps attempting to entice me to buy now. Nevertheless, I will remain disciplined and wait for some positive news or events that will substantially change the fundamentals of the company. These events include the upcoming fourth quarter and updates on the GOCOVRI-MS and ADS-4101 programs. Other expected catalysts include the reveal of additional GOCOVRI indications and other new pipeline candidates.\\n However, I find the catalyst with most weight would be an update on the Osmotica litigation. As of now, OSMOLEX ER has yet to fully hit the market, but the company expects to “fully roll-out” in January 2019. Without any update about the ongoing legal proceedings, we have to suspect OSMOLEX ER is still a threat. Without any news on the litigation, I will only add in small amounts till we see Q1 2019 numbers from GOCOVRI and OSMOLEX ER. Until then, I suggest current and potential investors to remain focused on the Q4 earnings report to see if the company’s altered GOCOVRI sales strategy has been operative.\\nDisclosure: I am/we are long ADMS.

With the markets the way they have been over the past quarter, and with a potential front-line partner in the process of being acquired, patience may be worth while. The company updated shareholders last week and stated the following: “As we first announced in August, we have been working through a formal partnering process for our ADHD assets, KP415 and KP484, and to date, we have generated a significant amount of interest. A number of companies have signed confidentiality agreements with us and have been conducting due diligence. From these efforts, we have received multiple early offers and indications of interest from both strategic and financial partners. Our next step is to undertake a second round of discussions over the coming weeks with the parties that have indicated interest in partnering the ADHD assets, and with other parties that may come forward, as we seek to maximize shareholder value in finding the right partner and commercialization strategy for these product candidates.” - said Travis Mickle, Ph.D., President and Chief Executive Officer of KemPharm  A top-tier partner has always been Shire (SHPG). The company has an already established ADHD franchise and has the right of first refusal on the KemPharm drug candidates KP415 and KP484. Shire is in the midst of being acquired by Japanese pharma powerhouse Takeda (TKPYY) in a deal worth about $60 billion. As one might imagine, that deal is likely taking a lot of focus away from other company actions. Takeda shareholders have approved the deal and the company announced that it plans to finish the deal on January 8th. Once that deal is complete, the company can shift to matters such as obtaining rights to new products.\\n Chocolate vs. Vanilla The Shire ADHD drug that is a top seller is Vyvanse. That drug is an amphetamine based product. The KemPharm product is a methylphenidate (actually a pro-drug of methylphenidate). This actually places the drugs in two distinct categories. Keeping the discussion simple, this is essentially a chocolate vs. vanilla situation. Some patients are better treated with a amphetamine product (chocolate), while others are better treated with a methylphenidate product (vanilla). Similarly, some doctors prefer one type of treatment over the other. For Shire this may not about a new product cannibalizing Vynase, but rather complimenting it in the best possible manner.  \\n\\n If Shire already possesses a top tier amphetamine product (chocolate) yet loses sales because it does not have a top tier methylphenidate product (vanilla), the combination of chocolate and vanilla product in the sales bag could be compelling and a windfall for the company. Sales reps often get limited exposure to doctors, but having all bases covered with both chocolate and vanilla options in the sales bag is wise. In fact, it can be argued that Shire is the best possible partner for KemPharm and that a delay in getting a deal done could deliver the best in terms of shareholder value. Other Deals  In its briefing to shareholders the company indicated multiple interested parties, multiple confidentiality agreements, and multiple early offers. In my opinion the company could be interested in some of these offers, but may be doing the prudent thing in pressing the pause button. After all, you never want to start an auction until you have all of the bidders in the room and paying close attention. With Shire having the right of first refusal, yet tied up in being acquired, putting the best offer on the table for them to consider is likely critical. Some good news is that the right of first refusal does put a clock on Shire once a bona-fide offer put to them.\\n Reading between the lines, it would appear to me that some of the offers the company is receiving are perhaps not quite as good as KemPharm would like to see. I say this in the sense of the overall deal and the ability of a company to maximize sales in an immediate way. Think of it this way. If company A and company B have similar offers in up front cash and royalties, but company B his already established in the ADHD space, the offer of company B may be superior. If a knock-your-socks-off deal was put on the table, the actions on right of first refusal would have already been happening. To be clear, I am not stating that the current offers are good or bad. We have no way to know that. I am simply pointing out that the likelihood is that the current offers are worth considering once Shire enters the proverbial auction room. Now let's connect more dots. Seeing multiple companies step up to the plate, even knowing that there is a right of first refusal, is a signal that the data shows KP415 as a possible best in class ADHD drug has merit. The bottom line for investors is this. I believe that there will be a deal on KP415 and its sister drug KP484 in Q1. I believe that when a deal is struck that it will be significant enough to boost the share price in a material manner. KemPharm stock has a 52 week trading range of $1.79 to $8.40. With the equity currently trading at just $1.92, the implied upside is orders of magnitude better than the downside risk. This presents a savvy trader or investor with a great potential stock play to start off the new year. No investment is risk free, but when the numbers, data, and situation show opportunity, it may be very wise to grab it. Stay Tuned! \\nDisclosure: I am/we are long KMPH.

Wells Fargo is currently trading at TTM P/E of 10.66 – 46% below its 52-week high and at a discount of 23% compared to the heavyweights in the U.S. financial segment (note: TTM P/E of the benchmark is 14.26). Capital Adequacy Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) capital ratio that consists mostly of common stock held by a bank is required to be above a certain minimum to ensure that the banks are protected against unexpected losses. Tier 1 is a bit broader measure that includes retained earnings, accumulated OCI and certain other adjustments. \\n\\n Source: Wells Fargo & Company's Basel III Pillar Regulatory Capital Disclosures on September 30, 2018 Given that under Basel III the minimum tier 1 capital ratio is 6%, Wells Fargo can be considered to be a well-capitalized bank. In 2018, its tier 1 was approximately 55% higher than the minimum required. All the capital ratios have shown a rather positive trend in each of the given years. Furthermore, the bank expects that in the future its capital adequacy will continue to strengthen. Putting WFC's CET1 ratio in the context of other large U.S. banks, it ranks higher as that of Citigroup's (NYSE:C), Goldman Sachs' (NYSE:GS) and Bank of America's (NYSE:BAC). JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) has only slightly higher CET1 (by 0.2%), but Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS) leads the list by a huge margin - CET1 of 16% as of Q2 2018.\\n Asset Quality Asset quality is one of the major aspects to be considered in assessing how safe a bank is. For instance, if a bank's credit policies are too liberal, there is a much higher risk that it will experience major write-downs during increased economic decline. \\n\\n Source: Author, based on Wells Fargo & Company's Basel III Pillar Regulatory Capital Disclosures on September 30, 2018, and December 31, 2017 Since December 2017, Wells Fargo has suffered a sharp decline in the residential mortgage – first lien positions. Because first lien is the safest class among the other mortgage positions, it is a bad sign for the overall quality of assets (first lien: bank gets paid first when a borrower defaults and the property is used as collateral for the debt). The only position under the total retail exposure that hasn’t declined is the qualifying revolving. Practically, qualifying revolving means that loans are given with no collateral. Total wholesale exposures have remained constant in absolute terms, but their quality has improved. Wells Fargo has managed to lower its exposure to high volatility commercial real estate. However, the total wholesale exposure is twice as big as it is in the retail segment, and the largest position is in corporate loans. This circumstance is somewhat risky, especially if one takes into account the increasing odds of a recession. In addition, the % of non-performing assets in the wholesale segment's largest position (corporate loans) has remained flat compared to the Q2, while, for instance, Q3 for BofA and Citigroup brought a reduction for the non-performing corporate assets of 30% and 4%, respectively. WFC's 0.46% of wholesale non-performing assets is indeed a low number, but compared to BofA's 0.18%, one can conclude that there is a room for improvement. The company's credit risk assessment of wholesale exposures by the probability of default (PD) grades shows that during 2018 Wells Fargo has managed to decrease the exposure-weighted PD from 0.9% to 0.77%. However, the loss given default (LGD) metric has increased sharply from 28.01% to 34.26% during the same time period. This means that while the probability of a wholesale segment loan defaulting has reduced, the share of a loan that is lost if a borrower defaults has increased. As of September 30, 2018, PD and LGD for BofA's wholesale clients were 0.62% and 30.95%, respectively.\\n \\n\\n Source: Wells Fargo & Company's Third Quarter 2018 Only 16% of the total assets on September 30, 2018, are classified as liquid (total cash, federal funds and trading at fair value), and compared to 2017, Wells Fargo's cash balances have reduced by 26%. Loans are the riskiest assets and they comprise almost 50% of the total assets. Compared to 2017, the relative size of loans in the balance sheet has increased by 1%. \\n\\n Source: Wells Fargo & Company's Annual Report 2017 As of December 31, 2017, the gross unrealized losses in all WFC's allocations improved considerably when compared to year-end 2016. This is a positive sign for the asset quality and the risk-controlled credit policy. In the Q3 report, it is stated that: Nonperforming assets decreased $410 million, or 5 percent, from second quarter 2018 to $7.6 billion. Nonaccrual loans decreased $433 million from second quarter 2018 to $7.1 billion reflecting both lower consumer and commercial nonaccruals. \\n\\n Source: Wells Fargo & Company's Third Quarter 2018 While there are some minor improvements in the % of allowances made, the overall structure hasn’t changed. Compared to 2016, WFC's provision for credit losses in 2017 was $2.5 billion compared with $3.8 billion a year ago. The above-average build in 2016 was primarily due to deterioration in the oil and gas portfolio, while the release in 2017 was due to strong underlying credit performance.\\n For instance, looking at JPMorgan's and BofA's Q3 Basel III disclosures, the exposure structure is similar to that of Wells Fargo's. However, these two banks have, to the contrary of WFC, managed to lower qualifying revolving relative balance exposure in their balance sheets. In addition, first lien mortgages in BofA and JPM comprise a much larger portion of the total retail exposure - as of 30th September 2018, BofA had 76%, JPM 86.6% while for WFC it was only 29%. The positive trend in net charge-offs can be seen in all of the top 4 biggest U.S. banks, but the considerable decrease in liquid assets has happened to only WFC. While Citigroup indeed experienced a minor reduction of 0.4% in its liquid assets, it cannot be compared to the approximately 20% reduction in WFC's case. Management On Sept. 8, 2016, Wells Fargo admitted that it had created millions of accounts in the names of its clients without receiving their permission. Yahoo finance has outlined some of the noteworthy incidents that have happened in the past few years:  September 2016: The fake account scandal September 2016: Improperly repossessing service members’ cars December 2016: Wells Fargo fails its ‘living will’ test March 2017: More fake accounts March 2017: Flunked community lending test April 2017: Whistleblower wins $5.4 million and his job back August 2017: Lawsuit over overcharging small business retailers February 2018: Federal Reserve restricts size February 2018: Sacramento sues over discrimination against black and Latino borrowers March 2018: Wealth management investigation emerges April 2018: $1 billion settlement for mortgage locks and auto-loan issues May 2018: Altering business information without client knowledge May 2018: $480 million to settle securities-fraud lawsuit June 2018: SEC fine for leading investors astray July 2018: Refunds over add-ons like pet insurance and legal services July 2018: Private Bank wealth management issues August 2018: Wells Fargo pays $2.1 billion for its role in housing bubble August 2018: Hundreds of houses foreclosed on due to computer glitch \\n In my opinion, although WFC's management is striving to regain trust by taking some extensive measures, the aforementioned have damaged my trust on the bank and it will take much longer time and more evidence to rebuild it. Earnings Throughout 2013-TTM, the total interest income has increased steadily. While loans and leases are the largest sources of interest income, revenue from other assets have contributed equally to the increasing income. Namely, the largest income source has somewhat stagnated compared to the revenues from other assets, that might imply increased challenges for further income generation. \\n\\n Source: Morningstar Looking at TTM, provisions for credit losses have declined, helping net income position to show a tiny growth. Total non-interest revenue has remained more or less flat for 5 straight years - TTM indicates that there is even a small dip relative to 2017. \\n\\n Source: Author, based on the data from Morningstar However, total interest expense has skyrocketed compared to the interest income growth, causing a substantial margin erosion. It seems that since 2015, Wells Fargo hasn't managed to fight back margin pressure and the current trend curve sends no signals of any reversal. A similar pattern is observed for other U.S. heavyweights, where the total interest expense as a % of total revenue has sharply increased since 2015. The cost of funding at banks has soared due to alternative investments and Quantitative Tightening.\\n Liquidity and Sensitivity (sensitivity to market risk) Bank liquidity risk is the risk of meeting present and near future cash flow needs without adversely affecting daily operations. The liquidity coverage ratio (LCR) requires banks to have a sufficient quantity of high-quality liquid assets (HQLA) to cover the cash outflows (NCOF) it would experience in a 30-day stress event. \\n\\n Source: Wells Fargo & Company's Annual Report 2017 As of December 31, 2017, the bank was very well positioned in terms of its liquidity since its LCR exceeded the required minimum by 24%. According to WFC's management, the actual liquidity is even higher to that of what is reflected via LCR: Our primary sources of liquidity are substantially the same in composition as HQLA under the LCR rule; however, our primary sources of liquidity will generally exceed HQLA calculated under the LCR rule due to the applicable haircuts to HQLA and the exclusion of excess HQLA at our subsidiary insured depository institutions required under the LCR rule. The nature of a bank's assets and liabilities make it sensitive to market risk. Potential changes in interest rates and moves in exchange rates can leave a serious impact on the bank's performance. \\n\\n Source: Wells Fargo & Company's Annual Report 2017 In 2017, WFC's average VaR increased by $2 million, but even with this increase, one can conclude that Wells Fargo manages its market risk very well. For instance, if one compares VaR to the equity or net income he or she would realize, it is less than 1% of any of those numbers. With some extremely minor discrepancies, other top 4 biggest U.S. banks have essentially the same situation when looking at the VaR. Furthermore, one can observe that although WFC's LCR is indeed high when compared to the minimum required, it does lay almost at the same level as the U.S. average - 120.4%.\\n Conclusion Given the current levels of WFC's capital ratios and the expected increase in tier 1, its capital adequacy component can be considered to be good. Non-performing loans and unrealized losses have decreased, but the drastic reduction in secured and liquid assets coupled with the increase in more riskier assets worsens the overall asset quality. Other U.S. heavyweights have experienced the same (but in a territory of few %, not as for WFC -20%) reductions in liquid assets; however, their high-quality asset weights in the balance sheet are much higher than WFC's. In addition, the major increase in loss given default of its wholesale loans sends no encouraging signal either. While there are some clear signs of how the management tries to rebuild trust, all the scandals clearly outweigh those improvements. Earnings are stable, and the revenue components have increased steadily. Nevertheless, the margins have constantly deteriorated and it seems that the management cannot get interest expense under control. 124% LCR exceeds the minimum level of 100%, and VaR, which is less than 1% of WFC's equity and net income, can be viewed positively. For Wells Fargo, I give a bearish outlook due to almost non-existent earnings growth and its poor asset quality in comparison to other major U.S. players. In a crisis scenario, the bad asset quality could play a damaging role affecting the business negatively.\\nDisclosure: I/we have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

This article takes a look at the margins, revenue, and costs for several US air carriers, including Delta, American (AAL) and United (UAL). Airlines draw revenue from multiple sources, including ticket sales, customer fees, cargo, credit card agreements, and third-party advertising. Today we will focus solely on revenue generated by tickets sales and the cost associated with providing those tickets. One of the most common metrics in the airline world is Available Seat Miles (NYSEMKT:ASM) which is the total number of miles flown by all of the seats installed in a specific airline’s fleet, regardless of whether the seats are occupied or not. Let’s take a look at how costs, revenues, and margins are analyzed using ASM. Passenger Revenue Per Available Seat Mile \\n\\nSource: Three Point Aviation Services LLC\\n Passenger Revenue per Available Seat Mile (PRASM) looks at the amount of passenger ticket revenue an airline can generate in comparison to the number of available seats. This metric penalizes airlines for allowing seats to leave the ground empty and provides a better picture of airline revenue management by accounting for the fact that some airlines hold out for higher prices, intentionally allowing some seats to depart empty. Delta Air Lines comes in on top with 14.59, beating out its closest rivals American Airlines and United Airlines, at 11.99 and 11.32, respectively. Southwest Airlines (LUV) came in second highest at 12.44 cents per mile, suggesting that it has moved out of its low-cost phase and begun to function more like a traditional carrier. However, it should be noted that Southwest does not charge bag fees, and therefore must generate most of its revenue directly from ticket sales. If the other air carriers used a price structure similar to Southwest, their numbers would be higher, lessening (or eliminating) Southwest’s lead. Spirit Airlines (SAVE) came in the lowest, for two reasons. First, Spirit on average configures its aircraft to carry more passengers, which spreads out the operating cost over more seats. In turn, the airline offers more ASM which it sells at a lower price to customers. Second, Spirit, like Allegiant Travel (ALGT) and privately held Frontier Airlines, generates a large portion of its total revenue by ancillary fees, including bag fees. The revenue generated by these fees is not included in the PRASM calculation. PRASM is calculated by dividing Passenger Ticket Revenue by ASM. See the equation below. (Again, passenger services fees, cargo and other revenue are not included here.) \\n\\nSource: Three Point Aviation Services LLC\\n Cost Per Available Seat Mile \\n\\nSource: Three Point Aviation Services LLC Of course, where there is revenue, there is cost. When looking at revenue in reference to ASM it makes sense to also look at cost through the lens of ASM. Cost per Available Seat Mile (NASDAQ:CASM) provides a means to compare the operating cost of different sized airlines. The upside to CASM is that it not only allows direct comparison of operating costs but also allows for a direct comparison of PRASM. CASM is affected by two main factors: operating costs and the average number of seats on board the aircraft. (Route planning also plays a role in CASM, but that is beyond the scope of this article.) CASM serves as an indicator of the cost of actually moving passengers. Airlines with higher cost structures will have higher CASM on average. Secondly, the number of seats onboard the airline’s fleet makes a significant difference. As mentioned earlier, Spirit Airlines has more seats on its aircraft than many of its competitors. This spreads out the cost of operating the flight and results in a lower CASM. Airlines like Delta, American, and United offer premium seating which results in fewer total seats on board. In those instances, CASM is higher because there are less seats to absorb the cost; however, PRASM is generally higher as well, because the higher revenue generated by the premium seating is averaged across all of the seats in the aircraft. CASM can be calculated by dividing the Total Operating Costs by ASM. CASM can also be calculated by first determining the per-mile cost of each sub-component (fuel, labor, etc.) and then adding them together. See the equation below. (Note: operating costs exclude finance and other fixed costs associated with operating an airline.)\\n \\n\\nSource: Three Point Aviation Services LLC Seat Profit Margins \\n\\nSource: Three Point Aviation Services LLC \\n\\nSource: Three Point Aviation Services LLC It’s time to put it all together. Revenue and costs mean very little in a vacuum, but mean quite a bit as a pair. Margins provide not only an insight into profitability but also sustainability, which is critical in the capital intensive airline industry. Let’s take a look at the Seat Profit Margin (SPM) which is simply PRASM minus CASM. As shown in the chart above, three of the carriers surveyed had a negative SPM. Does this mean those airlines are losing money? Not necessarily. A negative SPM only indicates that the ticket prices alone are not enough to cover the direct cost of the flights. However, as we noted before, SPM does not take into account other revenue sources such as cargo, change fees, and the highly despised – luggage charges. SPM can be calculated as a nominal number by using the equation below. \\n\\nSource: Three Point Aviation Services LLC\\n Alternatively, SPM can be calculated as a percentage as shown below. \\n\\n Source: Three Point Aviation Services LLC The four airlines, with negative SPM, United, American, Spirit and Allegiant and American were all profitable for the year 2017, which is the most recent data available. However, they relied on revenue from additional sources. United and American generated additional revenue through passenger service fees, credit cards agreements, cargo, and a host of miscellaneous services. Spirit and Allegiant relied heavily on passenger service charges, which accounted for 48.4% and 42.3% of the companies’ respective passenger-related revenues. Alaska Air Group (ALK) only had a passenger margin of 3.6%; however, the airline generates additional revenue through passenger service fees and a significant revenue stream through cargo operations. JetBlue’s (JBLU) SPM was also fairly low, at 4.4%. The airline creates additional revenue by offering a range of passenger upgrade options, but does not rely on these fees as heavily as some of its competitors. Conclusion Delta had the industry’s highest Seat Profit Margin (SPM) in 2017. This is a good sign for the airline’s profitability and shows efficient use of resources. An airline that has positive SPM also has more flexibility to adjust, waive or eliminate passenger service charges, which is important to gaining and maintaining customer relations. Profit margins based solely on ticket sales (SPM) offer a single snapshot of a much larger picture of airline profitability. However, PRASM and CASM, along with SPM, provide helpful metrics for comparing airline performance and provide insights into the structure and business model of the airline industry.\\n Investors should combine this data with other helpful measures, such as Net Margins, Cash Flow, Price-to-Earnings Ratio, and Earning Forecasts, to create a more comprehensive image of the aviation industry. Just like aviation, investing is about both the destination and the journey. Research Notes  Alaska Airlines derives a significant portion of its revenue from cargo operations. The airline also generates ancillary revenue from passenger service fees. The numbers presented here only account for revenue derived directly from passenger ticket sales. Spirit Airlines offers low priced tickets without bundling, then offers all premium features for an additional fee. These additional fees comprise a significant portion of the airline’s revenue. Only 51.6% of Spirit’s annual revenue is attributed to ticket sales. This results in an under reporting of passenger revenue as compared to other airlines. Similar to Spirit Airlines, Allegiant Travel offers low priced tickets without bundling, but offers premium features/services for an additional fee. These additional fees make up a significant portion of the airline’s revenue. Only 57.7% of Allegiant’s passenger-related revenue is attributed to ticket sales. This results in an under reporting of passenger revenue as compared to other airlines. In contrast to Spirit and Allegiant, Southwest Airlines generates the bulk of its passenger revenue through the sale of tickets that already include luggage and other features. Therefore, Southwest’s passenger ticket revenue is higher in this analysis than it would have been if the airline unbundled its services. \\nDisclosure: I/we have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

While the S&P 500 has just barely dipped into a bear market, over 60% of its components have.  This means that today value dividend growth investors have their pick of even the highest quality blue chips, many that are trading at their most attractive valuations in a decade. This is why my new Deep Value Dividend Growth Portfolio has been scooping up the best bargains left and right in recent weeks.  But the one downside to nearly everything being on sale is that, well, almost everything is on sale! We all have limited capital to work with, and when faced with so many great bargains we have to be selective and put our money to work in the best way that fits with our long-term investing goals.  For most of my readers that mean a focus on three things:   a high but safe dividend yield strong long-term dividend growth potential a large margin of safety (big discounts to fair value) \\n All three of these strategies have been proven over decades to be time-tested ways of maximizing both safe income, and long-term total returns.  Which brings us to the topic of this article. In recent weeks the price of oil has plunged by 43%, faster in fact, than during the Great Oil Crash of 2014-2016 (when crude ultimately fell 76% from its peak). As a result, energy stocks have been smashed, sending yields on blue-chips like BP (BP) soaring to mouth-watering levels.  But in the spirit of \"always consider superior alternatives\", and with a mind towards those three key attributes that all long-term dividend growth investors should focus on, I must point out that TransCanada (TRP) offers everything BP does, yet so much more.  Let\\'s take a look at the four reasons why TransCanada is the hands down better choice for value-focused high-yield income investors today. These four factors are what is likely to ultimately translate into about 18% long-term total returns. That means that TRP is likely to outperform BP and the S&P 500 by about 55% and 100%, respectively, over the coming decade.  1. BP Can\\'t Hold A Candle To TransCanada\\'s Commodity Insensitive And Recession-Resistant Business Model BP is one of the world\\'s oldest (founded in 1889) and largest integrated oil giants. That means its benefits from a relatively diversified (for an oil producer) business that includes:   operations in 70 countries 18.4 billion barrels of proven reserves (16.7 years of current production of 3.6 million bpd) 19.75% stake in Rosneft (Russia\\'s largest oil company) 18,300 global gas stations (retail operations) 1.7 million barrels per day of refining capacity 15.3 million tons of annual petrochemical capacity per day 1.4 GW of wind power (diversifying into renewable energy)  The benefit of vertical integration is that it helps to smooth out a company\\'s cash flow over time. When upstream (oil & gas production) is hurt by lower commodity prices, downstream (refining and chemicals) benefits from lower input costs and usually higher margins. \\n What\\'s more, BP has proven itself adaptable to rapidly changing industry conditions. For example, since 2016 it\\'s brought 19 projects online ahead of schedule and under budget. This stronger capital allocation should further boost the company\\'s profitability as well as result in fewer write-offs, both metrics on which the company has historically done well on compared to its peers.  \\n\\n(Source: Exxon investor presentation) And most importantly, BP has focused in recent years of improving its safety record. The 2010 Deep Water Horizon oil disaster (the largest spill in US history) ultimately forced BP to cut its dividend in half due to the uncertainties surround total legal liabilities. Those liabilities are now estimated at $61.6 billion, of which the company has paid out $38.6 billion through 2017. Through 2035 the final addition cost will total $23 billion, including $3 billion in 2018, $2 billion in 2019 and then $1 billion per year after that for the next 15 years. The company plans to help meet those legal bills through $2 to $3 billion in annual asset sales over the next few years.  \\n\\n (Source: BP investor presentation) To ensure that such a disaster doesn\\'t repeat itself BP has drastically improved its operational safety metrics and is now inline with most of its peers. That effort has been led by CEO Robert Dudley who took over in late 2010 after the Deep Water Horizon explosion. His top priority was in improving safety since BP\\'s track record on that front had been abysmal (numerous accidents in the 15 previous years). \\n Meanwhile to ensure a safe dividend (the biggest priority for high-yield energy investors) BP has refocused its business model on achieving sufficient cost savings to be able to maintain the payout even if Brent crude (global oil standard) is $50 over time (it\\'s currently $51). Analysts expect that this dividend breakeven point will fall below $50 by 2021.  A good part of the new leaner business model is reducing operating costs ($7 billion per year since 2014 and a 45% reduction in per barrel drilling costs) and cutting capex to about $16 billion per year. That\\'s about a 35% reduction from 2013\\'s peak of $25 billion per year in spending. And while the company did have to sell many downstream assets due to the Deep Water Horizon disaster, that has left BP with a far higher-quality mix of refineries. 40% of those are in the US, mostly located in the middle of the continent. These facilities have access to discounted US shale oil which means higher margins and better potential to export refined products to fast-growing emerging markets (via the Gulf Coast). Analysts expect that BP\\'s ROIC on its downstream operations should end up about 100% higher in the coming years compared to 2010 to 2014.  But while BP\\'s dividend appears safe, even at today\\'s much lower oil prices, and the company has managed an impressive safety turnaround in recent years, ultimately BP\\'s business model remains far inferior to TransCanada\\'s where it matters most.  TransCanada was founded in 1951 and is North America\\'s second oldest and largest midstream company (only Enbridge is larger or older).  \\n\\n (Source: TransCanada investor presentation) Since 2000 alone the company has invested over $63 billion into expanding its continent-spanning and vertically integrated network of oil & gas pipelines, storage operations, and export facilities. The company\\'s highly diversified operations even include 6.6 GW of regulated utilities which further helps to stabilize its distributable cash flow or DCF. DCF is the industry equivalent of free cash flow and what funds the dividend.\\n TransCanada\\'s crown jewel assets are its NGTL and Mainline pipeline systems which provide 75% of takeaway capacity for Western Canada\\'s Sedimentary Basin or WCSB. This is the continent\\'s largest natural gas formation, bigger than even the US Marcellus/Utica shale.  \\n\\n (Source: TransCanada Investor Presentation) And note that reserve estimates for all major North American gas shale formations continue to rise at rapid rates as improved fracking technology makes available every more production capacity even at low prices.  In total TransCanada\\'s networks carry 25% of Canada\\'s oil exports to the US and 25% of the entire continent\\'s natural gas. \\n\\n (Source: TransCanada Investor Presentation) Just 5% of TRP\\'s cash flow is exposed to commodity prices or volume risks. The rest is either in highly regulated industries (where returns on capital are set by government officials) or under very long-term contracts. What\\'s more those contracts are almost all with investment grade counterparties (strong oil producers or regulated utilities) creating minimal counterparty risk.  How long-term are those contracts? Well, usually new contracts are for 20 to 30 years in duration. TransCanada\\'s contract profile is excellent.   NGTL and Mainline: 10-year average remaining duration Keystone: 13 years remaining (on the 20-year initial term) for 90% of capacity Mexican pipelines: 25-year initial terms  \\n\\n\\n (Source: TransCanada Investor Presentation)  That rock solid cash flow is what has allowed TransCanada to grow its dividend for 18 consecutive years putting it on track to eventually become the second dividend aristocrat in the industry (in 2025). Note that since 2000 we\\'ve had three oil crashes, two recessions, interest rates as high as 7% (on the 10-year yield), and the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression. Unlike BP, TransCanada hasn\\'t had to cut its dividend or even stop growing it. Even more impressive is that the growth rate has been a solid 7% CAGR over that time and is set to accelerate in the coming years. TransCanada\\'s more stable business model and rock steady (and faster) dividend growth explain why TransCanada has managed to be a far better long-term investment than BP. In fact, despite the midstream bear market (now in its fifth year), long-term TransCanada investors have still enjoyed excellent returns over time. And outside of oil crashes, industry bear markets, and the tech bubble, TRP has consistently been a market-beater.  \\n\\nBP Total Return Price data by YCharts But past performance is no guarantee of future results. Which brings me to the next reason why high-yield energy bargain hunters should choose TransCanada over BP. That would be a far superior, and less risky, long-term growth potential.  2. TransCanada Has A Much Less Risky Long-Term Growth Runway BP has a solid growth plan, including boosting its oil & gas production by 900,000 bpd by 2021 (25% above current levels). 85% of the projects to deliver on that goal are already underway. Better yet those projects are expected to deliver 35% better profitability than its existing production assets, which should boost the company\\'s free cash flow (what pays the dividend) significantly. \\n \\n\\n (Source: BP investor presentation) What\\'s more Morningstar\\'s Dave Meats expects BP\\'s production growth through 2022 to be about 5% CAGR, one of the highest figures among integrated oil giants and in line with management guidance. A big part of that growth plan calls for tapping into America\\'s booming shale oil bonanza. BP recently announced its largest deal to date (under its current CEO), a $10.5 billion acquisition of BHP\\'s (BHP) US shale assets.  Management called that deal \"transformational\" because it included 500,000 producing acres in some of America\\'s hottest shale oil regions. The company marked the occasion by announcing the first dividend hike in four years as well as authorizing a $6 billion buyback.  Why is BP spending a fortune (though about 50% less than what BHP paid in 2010) to buy this shale acreage? Well for two key reasons. First, US shale breakeven costs have now fallen to extremely low levels thanks to improved fracking 3.0 technology.  \\n\\n (Source: Pioneer Natura Resources Investor presentation) Most US shale formations can now profitably produce at under $40 (current price $43) and even $30 for many of the most prolific and largest formations.  As a result, US shale is expected to boom for the next decade with OPEC (hardly a fan of America\\'s energy boom) estimating that shale production will double by 2029 to 16 million barrels per day. For context back in 2005, America\\'s total oil production was just five million bpd. BP wants to get a cut of that sweet low-cost production growth, which will help bolster its returns on capital and boost its FCF in the coming years. \\n \\n\\n(Source: US Energy Information Administration) Better yet? According to the US EIA shale is going to drive continued strong growth in US oil production with total national output not expected to peak until about 2040. This shows that for BP, shale isn\\'t just a great way to achieve strong short-term and low-cost production growth, but potentially fuel its cash flow growth for at least the next decade, and maybe two.  In the medium-term, the company expects its growth plans to result in about $14.5 billion in pre-tax FCF by 2021, assuming global oil prices average $55 by then (most analysts think it will be $60+). With a current annual dividend cost of just $5.6 billion that puts BP\\'s 2021 FCF target payout ratio guidance at about 40%. \\n\\n (Source: BP investor presentation) Better yet? Beyond 2021 BP expects its wide assortment of attractive growth opportunities to continue to fuel strong production and free cash flow growth.  \\n\\n (Source: BP investor presentation) Nearly $10 billion in retained free cash flow by 2021 means that, theoretically, BP has huge dividend growth potential, and might be able to buy back a lot of shares in the coming years. And by 2025 the company believes it can growth pre-tax FCF by another 45% beyond 2021 levels (about $21 billion). But while BP\\'s long-term growth plans are certainly a reason to be bullish on the stock, the simple fact is that TransCanada is a far less risky, and faster growing way to profit from North America\\'s epic energy boom. \\n Ultimately that\\'s because BP\\'s growth plans require it to continue to bring projects online on time and on budget, which is far from guaranteed. What\\'s more, its free cash flow projections are tied to highly volatile commodity prices.  TransCanada meanwhile, doesn\\'t have to worry about commodity prices and serves a far larger market. BP is just one company (and a client of TRP\\'s) but TransCanada serves every major oil & gas producer in North America.  \\n\\n (Source: TransCanada Investor Presentation) What\\'s more, while it\\'s certainly true that execution risk is present in the midstream industry (see risk section) ultimately earning good returns on midstream assets is far more predictable given the regulated nature of the business.  \\n\\n (Source: TransCanada Investor Presentation) - figures in CAD New projects aren\\'t even begun until most of the capacity has obtained long-term, and often volume committed contracts with large producers (who are unlikely to go bankrupt in an oil crash). Some of those contracts are for over 30 years in duration (mostly gas).  Better yet? TransCanada\\'s ability to execute on its massive growth plans is 100% independent of fickle equity markets.  \\n\\n (Source: TransCanada Investor Presentation) \\n That\\'s thanks to its plans to payout just 40% of long-term DCF in dividends and retain 60% of cash flow to fund its growth. And where the company sees the opportunity to obtain good returns on invested capital and its retained cash flow falls short, it can always tap its $7.6 billion in remaining liquidity under its credit facilities. But don\\'t let the future use of debt fool you. TransCanada has been steadily deleveraging its balance sheet (already one of the safest in the industry) and plans to maintain very safe debt levels over the long-term.  \\n\\n (Source: TransCanada Investor Presentation)  In the midstream industry, credit rating agencies and bond investors consider 5.0 or less debt/EBITDA safe and TransCanada is on track to achieve sub 5.0 leverage next year. That\\'s the level that management plans to maintain over the long-term. That will help it to retain its industry-leading (along with other top blue-chips like EPD, MMP, and ENB) BBB+ credit rating and very low long-term borrowing costs (that lock in profitability on projects).  This \"self-funding\" business model (organic growth requires zero equity issuances) means that the company\\'s reliance on debt and equity markets will be substantially reduced, and thus make this already low-risk sleep well at night or SWAN stock an even lower risk investment.  This means that while BP can cash in on US shale for itself, TransCanada gets to enjoy serving essentially a utility function, by being an \"energy toll-road\" for all North American producers. This opens its already industry-leading growth backlog ($41 billion including projects in the planning stages) to even larger opportunities in the future.  \\n\\n(Source: Interstate Natural Gas Association of America)\\n Here are the latest midstream infrastructure need projections to support this continent\\'s epic long-term boom in oil & gas.   By 2021: $100 billion in new US midstream infrastructure needed  By 2035: $791 billion in new US midstream infrastructure required By 2050: over $1.2 trillion in US/Canadian midstream infrastructure growth opportunities  While BP\\'s growth opportunities may be large, TransCanada\\'s secular growth tailwinds are absolutely staggering. This means that ultimately TransCanada is likely to deliver not just generous and safe dividends, but faster-growing payouts for decades to come. Which in turn translates into far better total return potential than either BP or the market in general.  3. Dividend Profile: TransCanada Is The Clearly Better Long-Term Dividend Growth Stock The most important part of any dividend investment is the payout profile which consists of three parts, yield, safety, and long-term growth potential. Along with valuation, this is what tends to drive total returns over time.            Company Yield TTM Cash Flow Payout Ratio 10-Year Expected Cash Flow Growth 10-Year Total Return Potential (No Valuation Change) Valuation-Adjusted Total Return Potential   BP 6.7% 119% 5.0% 11.7% 11.7%   TransCanada 5.9% 46% 8.2% 14.1% 18.2%   S&P 500 2.2% 33% 6.4% 8.60% 5% to 9.5%   (Sources: Simply Safe Dividends, Gurufocus, Fast Graphs, Morningstar, Vanguard, Multipl.com, Yardeni Research, Gordon Dividend Growth Model, Dividend Yield Theory) Both BP and TransCanada offer mouth-watering yields, far above that of the broader market (whose yield is now at multi-year highs). But while BP\\'s payout is higher than TRP\\'s note that the company is currently not covering its dividend with free cash flow. TransCanada on the other hand currently enjoys the highest coverage ratio in the industry (DCF/dividend was 2.3 in the most recent quarter). And the highly stable and commodity/recession-resistant nature of its cash flow means that TRP\\'s dividend safety is vastly superior to BP\\'s. \\n          Company Debt/EBITDA Interest Coverage Ratio S&P Credit Rating Average Interest Cost   BP 1.8 7.7 A- 4.5%   Industry Average 1.8 11.5 NA NA   (Sources: Gurufocus, Morningstar, Fast Graphs) But BP\\'s high payout ratio doesn\\'t mean the dividend is unsafe though because all oil majors build into their business models the need to fund both capex and dividends with debt during lean times (such as during an oil crash). BP\\'s balance sheet is very strong and this will make the chances of a dividend cut low unless oil prices fall further and remain below $50 for several years.  A strong balance sheet is the other half of the dividend safety equation and fortunately, TRP\\'s is among the best in the industry.           Company Debt/EBITDA Interest Coverage Ratio S&P Credit Rating Average Interest Cost   TransCanada 5.4 5.6 BBB+ 4.0%   Industry Average 4.4 4.5 NA NA   (Sources: Morningstar, Gurufocus, earnings releases, Fast Graphs) At first glance, you might not think so, given that its leverage ratio is higher than the industry average. The key to TRP\\'s industry-leading credit rating (which allows very low borrowing costs no matter what interest rates are doing) is the highly diversified nature of its business and great contract profile.  Because the company faces very little default risk on its contracts, neither the credit rating agencies nor bond investors are worried about TransCanada\\'s debt and neither should dividend investors. Especially given that management is planning on taking its leverage to sub 5.0 in 2019 and plans to fund growth through 2021 with very little debt (it\\'s likely to fall to 4.5 or below).  Finally, we come to dividend growth potential. By the nature of its more stable cash flow, midstream stocks have a built-in advantage of providing far more stable dividend growth. BP\\'s payout may indeed growth strongly in the future, however over the next 10 years, analysts expect that oil giant to grow its FCF by just 5% CAGR and most of that is front-loaded through 2025. And of course, since that FCF will depend on volatile oil prices, that 5% estimate is far from guaranteed. \\n In contrast, TRP\\'s 8.2% long-term DCF/share estimate is far more likely to come true given the very stable and utility-like nature of its business. Even assuming that both stocks\\' valuations never change over the next decade that translates into TRP offering a far more attractive total return potential (yield + long-term cash flow/dividend growth) of 14% compared to about 12% for BP.  For context, the S&P 500 has historically delivered 9.2% CAGR total returns and from today\\'s valuations is likely to do the same (possibly as much as 9.5%). Vanguard estimates 5% to 8% long-term market returns but in either case, both BP and TransCanada are likely to make good investments and provide double-digit total returns.  However, when we consider valuations then TRP\\'s advantage over BP grows even wider, with the stock\\'s 35% discount to fair value boosting its expected 10-year CAGR total return to about 18% (double that of the market and about 50% more than BP).  4. Valuation: TransCanada Is Trading At A Fire Sale Price While BP Is Merely Fairly Valued \\n\\nBP Total Return Price data by YCharts It\\'s been a weak year for stocks in general (the worst since 2008 in fact). Energy stocks have suffered recently due to the second oil crash in four years. TransCanada however, despite its commodity insensitive and low-risk business model, has fallen far harder than BP or the market in general. When stock prices become so widely disconnected from fundamentals that creates immense long-term buying opportunities for smart investors.  My favorite valuation approach for blue-chip dividend stocks is called dividend yield theory or DYT. This investing approach was popularized by asset manager/newsletter publisher Investment Quality Trends in 1966. The firm\\'s approach is to exclusively use DYT on quality dividend stocks and over the decades IQT has delivered 10% superior returns to the S&P 500 with 10% lower volatility. \\n \\n\\n(Source: Investment Quality Trends) DYT simply says that because dividends are paid out of cash flow (what ultimately underpins stock prices), yields are mean reverting (as long as the investment thesis doesn\\'t break). Thus a stock\\'s long-term historical yield can be thought of as a proxy for fair value.          Company Yield 5-Year Average Yield Discount To Fair Value   BP 6.7% 6.7% 0%   TransCanada 5.9% 3.9% 35%   (Sources: Simply Safe Dividends, Dividend Yield Theory) In order to be conservative (a prudent choice in today\\'s scary market environment) let\\'s only use each company\\'s five-year average yield, which incorporates two oil crashes, two market corrections, and today\\'s overall bear market. Despite its sky-high yield BP\\'s payout is just at its historical yield implying the stock is merely fairly valued right now. That doesn\\'t mean it\\'s not a good buy, but compared to TransCanada\\'s 35% discount to fair value it\\'s clear which stock likely has more upside potential.          Company Upside To Fair Value Long-Term Valuation Boost Valuation-Adjusted Total Return Potential   BP 0% 0.0% 11.7%   TransCanada 54% 4.4% 18.2%   (Source: Simply Safe Dividends, Fast Graphs, Dividend Yield Theory, Gordon Dividend Growth Model, Moneychimp) Over long periods of time (5 to 10 years) all stocks tend to revert to their historical yields (fair value) because ultimately fundamentals trump short-term sentiment. BP\\'s current fair value yield means that total returns would be purely driven by yield and long-term FCF/dividend growth, with little to no valuation boost.  In contrast, TRP\\'s share price would need to rise 54% faster than its DCF/share/dividend growth over time just to return it to fair value. Add that 4.4% CAGR valuation boost (over the next decade) to TransCanada\\'s yield + long-term expected cash flow/dividend growth and that\\'s how you get my valuation-adjusted long-term total return expectation of about 18%. \\n Ultimately it\\'s TRP\\'s much larger margin of safety that makes it a \"very strong buy\" compared to BP being merely a \"buy\". For a company of TRP\\'s caliber to be trading at such a large discount to fair value is an exceptional opportunity for long-term high-yield dividend growth investors to lock in World Class quality at a fire sale price. Just make sure you\\'re comfortable with TransCanada\\'s risk profile before you buy it.  Risks To Consider While I consider TransCanada to be one of the best high-yield blue-chips you can buy right now, no stock is \"risk-free\". So here are what potential TRP investors need to keep in mind.  First, be aware that while TransCanada pays its dividend in US dollars, it is a Canadian company. That means that investors owning shares in taxable accounts will face a 15% withholding tax. Fortunately, the US and Canada have a treaty that allows US investors to take a dollar for dollar tax credit that for most people will effectively negate this withholding tax. However, just $300/$600 of all your foreign dividend withholdings can be claimed on the standard 1040 tax form. Amounts larger than this require the more complex Form 1116.  As for risks to the company itself, there are two to be aware of. In the short to medium-term, all midstream companies face execution risk on getting projects into operation. This can be hampered by frequent court battles and the need to obtain regulatory approval from state, local and national governments.  For example, the Keystone XL pipeline project, an $8 billion undertaking that TransCanada began in 2008, was canceled in 2015 when President Obama pulled its final regulatory approval. President Trump then reinstated that approval and the company has obtained long-term (20-year) volume committed contracts for 90% of the pipeline\\'s capacity.  However, a recent court ruling has forced another U.S. environmental impact study (likely causing a one-year delay). That delay is for the project\\'s Montana section but there is also a case pending before the Nebraska Supreme court that has caused the company to not plan construction beginning until mid-2019. The company (and analysts) expect final approval to be obtained and the project to be completed in 2022. Note that Keystone XL is NOT part of the current growth backlog and TRP isn\\'t counting on its completion to achieve its 8% to 10% dividend growth through 2021. \\n But delays can be costly and ultimately force a company to spend more than it initially planned. For example, the company recently had to increase its budget for the Mountaineer XPress and WB XPress projects by $500 million, due to regulatory delays and higher than expected contractor costs. Higher costs are also coming from US steel tariffs (25%) which analysts expect will increase the cost of the Keystone XL project by $300 million.  And it\\'s not just US courts and regulators who sometimes cause trouble with new project construction. In 2017 TransCanada, facing years of delays from regulators and court challenges, decided to cancel the Energy East pipeline which would have carried Alberta tar sands to key export terminals. That $11.5 billion project was a major blow to the company\\'s backlog and forced it to take a $735 million write-down that year.  The good news is that with such a robust backlog of growth projects, TransCanada\\'s execution risk is relatively low for a midstream blue-chip. But just be aware that big backlogs and shadow backlogs are not a guarantee of large-scale cash flow growth because project delays and cancellations are always a risk.  The other risk to consider is that the entire midstream industry\\'s long-term growth thesis is predicated on forecasts of future oil & gas production. But forecasts are merely educated guesstimates and estimates of ultimate North American energy production over time are highly variable and ever-changing.  For example, here\\'s analyst firm McKinsey\\'s latest long-term (2050) global energy forecast:  Overall energy demand will flatten (due to efficiency improvements) and grow 0.7% a year through 2050 (30% lower than previous forecasts). Electricity demand will outpace all other energy sources by at least 2:1. Solar and Wind will account for 80% of new energy capacity through 2050. Gas demand will grow at 1.4% and oil 0.4% through 2050, but overall fossil fuel market share will fall from 82% of all energy use today to 74%. Petrochemical industry will account for 70% of oil demand growth. By 2030, 50 percent of new cars sold in China, the European Union, and the United States could be partially or fully electric (30% worldwide).  Peak global oil demand by 2036. \\n While McKinsey\\'s estimate that global peak oil demand won\\'t come for another 17 years is certainly bullish for energy stocks (including midstream giants like TRP) it\\'s important to note that just last year McKinsey\\'s peak oil demand estimate was set at 2030.  And McKinsey is just one analyst firm, whose long-term energy models can change drastically from year to year. The US EIA, which is extremely bullish on US shale production, expects US oil production to peak at 12 million BPD eventually. That\\'s compared to OPEC\\'s estimate of 17 to 18 million bpd. But while US shale has thus far spent a decade surprising to the upside, it\\'s always possible that trend doesn\\'t hold in the future.  What about long-term oil demand potentially falling off a cliff due to the worlds\\' transition to renewable energy?  \\n\\n(Source: International Energy Administration) Well, the good news for energy investors is that fears over such a shift, exemplified by the Paris climate change accords, are largely overblown. No country is on track to meet its Paris targets, and even if they were to all hit those targets natural decline rates in legacy oil fields (about 6% per year) would mean that massive North American production growth would still be needed to close the large production gap that\\'s coming by 2025.  \\n\\n(Source: Exxon investor presentation) And over the long-term that likely means that global oil & gas demand will remain strong enough to likely make midstream stocks like TRP a great investment. \\n But of course, we can\\'t forget one final risk, which is short-term share price volatility. Whether rational or not, when investors turn bearish on oil (as they are now) even quality midstream giants like TRP, whose cash flows have very little sensitivity to commodity prices, can fall off a cliff.  While investors who own the stock for its generous, safe and growing dividend can sleep well at night knowing that the current oil crash/price plunge doesn\\'t hurt the investment thesis, others are not so lucky. Specifically, I mean those with an improper asset allocation relative to their risk profile/short to medium-term needs. Remember that your portfolio\\'s mix of cash/bonds/stocks needs to structured in such a way that you can fund short-term needs (up to three years) with cash and then turn to bonds for both income and the ability to sell assets at appreciating prices (during a bear market). Stocks, even high-yield SWANs like TRP, can be highly volatile for years on end, and thus being forced to sell them at terrible times (like now) can be devastating for anyone whose equity portfolio isn\\'t large enough to live off safe and growing dividends alone.  Bottom Line: While Now Is A Fantastic Time To Buy High-Yield Energy Blue-Chips, TransCanada Is The Clearly Superior Dividend Growth Stock  Don\\'t get me wrong, I\\'m not saying that BP is a bad dividend stock to invest in, nor that its dividend is necessarily unsafe, even during the second oil crash in four years. But my point is that during a cyclical bear market, and an oil crash, all energy stocks are going to be selling at attractive prices.  Dividend investors will have their pick of even the best quality blue-chips which means that, with limited capital to invest, you will need to be selective. This is why I always recommend investors consider what qualities they are looking for from any company, and choose the one that best fits your needs and long-term objectives.  BP has certainly come a long way from the dark days of the Gulf of Mexico oil spill, and management\\'s new long-term growth plans are sound. But while BP offers a mouth-watering, and likely safe yield right now, the cash flow underpinning that payout is extremely volatile, which translates into extremely uncertain (and lumpy) long-term dividend growth prospects. \\n In contrast, TransCanada nearly matches BP on yield, has a commodity insensitive/recession-resistant business model, which has allowed it to deliver 18 consecutive years of payout growth. What\\'s more TransCanada\\'s long-term growth prospects, fueled by America\\'s massive energy boom, and low-risk, self-funding business model, means that TransCanada\\'s superior dividend growth is likely to continue for the foreseeable future.  Finally, when we look at valuations we find that BP\\'s sky-high yield doesn\\'t necessarily imply that investors will get much, if any long-term valuation boost. In contrast, TransCanada is one of the most undervalued blue-chips in its industry, and thus likely to deliver far superior total returns to both BP as well as the S&P 500.  No TransCanada isn\\'t perfect, and like any company, it has its own challenges to deal with. However, the company\\'s management team and corporate culture have proven they can adapt and overcome its risk profile in order to deliver market-beating returns over time. In my opinion, TransCanada\\'s superior cash flow stability, lower-risk growth profile, and much better valuation makes it the clearly superior high-yield energy investment to take advantage of this bear market/oil crash. \\nDisclosure: I/we have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

(DE) come to mind. The company generates revenue via the sale of equipment to John Deere dealers and distributors. Deere manufactures and distributes a range of agricultural equipment, commercial and consumer equipment, and equipment used for construction, road building and forestry. Markets for farm machinery and earth-moving equipment not only stabilized in 2018, but showed modest organic growth. Revenue Growth Has Been Robust For its most recent quarter, Deere had revenue of $9.4 billion, up 17% Y/Y. Agriculture and Turf revenue grew 3%, driven by higher shipment volumes and price realization. According to Deere's internal management presentation, worldwide Agriculture & Turf net sales are forecast to grow 3% in 2019. This is Deere's largest segment at about 60% of total revenue. Low single-digit revenue growth could drag down total revenue growth next year. \\n\\n Revenue for Construction and Forestry was $2.7 billion, up 65% Y/Y. The segment benefited from strong demand for construction and forestry equipment and the acquisition of Wirtgen, which contributed 45% of the segment's improvement. Management expects Construction and Forestry revenue to grow about 15% in 2019 on the strength of GDP growth, housing and construction.\\n The company's core operating income for Agriculture and Turf and Construction and Forestry was 7%, up from 6% in the year earlier period. This includes cost of goods sold, SG&A and R&D costs. Deere can amplify earnings growth by cutting costs in addition to added scale from revenue growth. The company has embraced digitalization and it could be key to driving operational efficiencies: Four, the example would be just all the journey that we can do internally in terms of improving efficiency and effectiveness of our operations just leveraging digitalization for example, okay, a small thought would be in shared services and accounting we use robotic process automation. There are so many places we intend to actually use such digitalization technologies to improve the effectiveness and efficiency. The use of technology to create efficiencies sounds exciting. Combined with the potential to reduce direct and indirect material costs, digitalization could lead to margin expansion. Deere may need these initiatives if the global economy falters and causes lower equipment sales. The company has also talked up the potential to share its digital technology with farmers and its dealer network. Deere's product support team allows dealers to remotely monitor ag equipment, and contact customers about repairs before product failures occur. Precision ag technology gathered within Deere's equipment could potentially help farmers improve crop yields as well. Deere charges farmers an annual subscription fee for this data. It could lead to more recurring revenue and potentially bind certain farmers to its ag equipment. Stagnant Growth In U.S. Farm Cash Receipts Another key metric in determining future equipment demand could be U.S. principal crop cash receipts. According to management, such receipts are estimated to be about $120 billion in 2019, flat with the 2018 forecast. Receipts include about $4 billion, representing one tranche in USDA aid distributed to farmers. Just under a billion has been paid out this year.\\n Annual crop cash receipts peaked at about $156 billion in 2012 and appear to have bottomed in 2015. From 2016 to 2018, they have yet to reached the approximately $132 billion level reported in 2014. Despite aid from the government, there is no guarantee receipts will come near the levels reached in 2014 or prior years. Moreover, the Federal Reserve continues to hike interest rates and unwind its $4 trillion balance sheet. Removing liquidity from financial markets has created volatility and I expect financial markets to fall further. This does not bode well for the stock. Weak industrial production could also stymie Deere's Construction and Forestry Segment. Conclusion DE is down over 10% Y/Y. The stock trades at nearly 19x earnings, which I believe is too robust for a cyclical name. I believe we are at peak economy and DE will likely fall further. Sell DE.\\nDisclosure: I/we have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours. I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions.

Included in this week\\'s report are the winners, losers and overall performance of the portfolio. We\\'ve also highlighted any deal completions or failures and changes to the list of the top 20 spreads for the coming week beginning 24th December. Winners This week’s best performer was NxStage Medical, Inc. (NXTM) gaining 1.23%, a rebound from last weeks worst performer status. Its deal to be acquired by Fresenius Medical Care has had a rollercoaster ride of late and provides an opportunity for actively trading the spread for those able to stay abreast of market developments. Belmond (NYSE:BEL) also performed strongly, up 1.18%. At one point during the week this stock was 1% above its offer price from Louis Vuitton Moet Hennessey as traders speculated on the possibility of a higher bid. Electro Scientific Industries (ESIO) was up 0.67% after Mr. John T C Lee (president of MKS, the acquirer) reiterated the anticipated closure of the deal in Q1 2019 and the appointment of a new vice president for ESI. Naturally, arbs looking for a \"sure thing\" won\\'t find many better than this but the spread is already priced accordingly. Finally, Integrated Device Technology Inc (IDTI) was up 0.54%, which on Wednesday received clearance from the State Administration for Market Regulation of the People’s Republic of China (“SAMR”), for its merger with Renesas Electronics Corp. The completion of this important step removes a potential significant roadblock in merger completion and has encouraged a large increase in the number of arbs participating in the deal. With the spread still offering 1.5% this looks to be an attractive situation.\\n Losers This week\\'s worst performer is Rent-A-Center Inc (RCII) down 10.01%. This loss was caused by RCII decision to terminate the deal with Vintage Capital Management. However, immediate broker upgrades following this announcement have pushed the stock ABOVE the offer price by the end of the week despite no longer being considered a merger arb play. Another significant loser (again) this past week was Essendant Inc (NASDAQ:ESND), down 3.98% as it once again extended its tender offer from Staples for another week. Also significantly in the red was Arris International (ARRS) down 3.94% having announced a shareholder meeting to take place on the 1st February 2019 to vote on the proposed deal from Commscope Hldg Co Inc Com. Avista Corp (AVA) was also down 2.53%, following its filing of a request (along with acquirer HydroOne) for reconsideration of denying state approval of the deal. This deal, whilst technically remaining live is now a highly speculative situation and is best traded by those with specialist knowledge of the legal situation. Others losers of note were Athenahealth (NASDAQ:ATHN) down 1.82%, (acquirer Veritas Capital & Evergreen Coast Capital), Redhat (NYSE:RHT) (acquirer International Business Machines) down 1.78%, and Travelport down 1.53% (acquirer Siris Capital Group, LLC and Evergreen Coast Capital).  Portfolio Performance Losers thoroughly outpaced winners this week by 15 to 5. The performance of the overall portfolio reflects this score but needs further explanation. During the week, the collapse of the RCII deal should require an immediate sale of the stock as per the portfolio composition rules. Using the closing price that same day the portfolio return is a very negative 1.39%. However, for those who continued to hold the stock until the end of the week the overall portfolio performance is negative 0.75%. There were no dividends paid during the week from the T20 list. The standard deviation of returns for the T20 was 1.67%. This is an out sized movement reflecting the volatility in the market and specific deal situations. The MNA ETF returned a negative performance of 1.32%, continuing a 5 week losing streak. The S&P 500 ETF, SPY which suffered a large sell-off on Friday, but also went ex-div to the tune of $1.435, endured yet another losing week and posted a huge loss of 7.04%. The VIX accordingly increased dramatically by 39.2%.\\n \\n\\n *We have not included MRGR ETF for liquidity reasons.

Company Overview: Stemline Therapeutics (STML) is a New York based clinical stage biotech company developing oncology therapeutics. Stemline Therapeutics currently has a market cap around $275 million and trades for around $8.50 a share. The shares are just outside the window for the classical definition of a \\'Busted IPO\\' as they have been public just over five years now. \\n\\n Pipeline: The company\\'s pipeline consists of three primary assets: SL-401, SL-801, and SL-701. In addition, the company\\'s assets also include SL-501 and SL-101, which are next-generation IL-3R-targeted compounds. Furthermore, the company has a proprietary drug discovery platform called StemScreen, and the company has amassed a robust intellectual property portfolio. The company\\'s credo is that the effective cancer therapeutics of the future will not only target tumor bulk but also will go deeper to the root of the cancer\\'s etiology. This means targeting cancer stem cells. Cancer stem cells only comprise 1% to 5% of a tumor but give rise to the other 95% to 99%, which is referred to as tumor bulk.\\n \\n\\n Source: Company Presentation In recent news, the company presented results from their ongoing Phase 1/2 Trial of SL-401 in patients with relapsed/refractory chronic myelomonocytic leukemia at the annual American Society of Hematology Meeting and Exposition. As evidenced by Roth Capital\\'s latest statements (See Analyst Commentary section), the presentation seems to have gone over well. Roth noted that the latest update showed a patient bridged to transplant, which they view as a big development. On November 20th, the European Medicines Agency granted accelerated assessment for centralized Marketing Authorization Application for Elzonris in blastic plasmacytoid dendritic cell neoplasm. The company expects to complete the MAA in Q1 of 2019. Last week, Elzonris was approved by the FDA for the treatment of blastic plasmacytoid dendritic cell neoplasm in adults and in pediatric patients aged two years or older. The approval came early and had a Boxed Warning for increased risk of capillary leak syndrome, which was a minor negative. \\n\\n Source: Company Presentation SL-401: SL-401 is a targeted therapy directed to the IL-3 receptor, which is present on a variety of hematologic cancers. The company is currently conducting 4 different trials across 5 different indications. This includes the potentially pivotal Phase 2 trial in blastic plasmacytoid dendritic cell neoplasm, a rare and aggressive type of blood cancer. The company will be presenting results from their Phase 2 Trial of SL-401 in patients with blastic plasmacytoid dendritic cell neoplasm at the annual American Society of Hematology Meeting and Exposition. Other key indications include chronic myelomonocytic leukemia and myelofibrosis. The company is finalizing registrational plans in the two indications, plan on seeking regulatory advice in early 2019, and intend on launching pivotal trials and/or cohorts.\\n In preparation for last week\\'s U.S. approval, the company has been focusing on pre-launch activities. This included the ramping up of their disease awareness campaign that is targeted at hematologist-oncologists, dermatologists, and pathologists. \\n\\n \\n\\n Source: Company Presentation SL-701: SL-701 is an immunotherapy designed to activate the immune system to attack tumors. A multicenter clinical trial of SL-701 in combination with an immunostimulant and bevacizumab is currently enrolling adult patients with glioblastoma multiforme in first recurrence. In October, the company released data from their Phase 2 trial of SL-701 in patients with second-line glioblastoma in an oral presentation given at the European Society of Medical Oncology Annual Congress. Moving forward, the company is working on determining the best path forward in order to unlock the most value for shareholders. They intend on releasing further updates at upcoming conferences. \\n\\n \\n\\n\\n Source: Company Presentation SL-801: SL-801 is a novel oral small molecule reversible inhibitor of XPO1, a key nuclear transport protein.

Research and development expenses for the third quarter of 2018 were $11.7 million compared to $12.4 million for the same period last year. General and administrative expenses for the third quarter of 2018 were $9.6 million compared to $4.1 million for the same period last year. The increase in expenses was primarily due to pre-launch activates relating to the commercialization of ELZONRIS in BPDCN. Overall, the company had a net loss of $21 million. The company has approximately a half dozen analyst firms that cover the stock with a median price target currently of just north of $30.00 a share. All six firms currently have a Buy or Outperform rating on the shares with price targets proffered ranging from $20.00 to $41.00 a share. This morning Piper Jaffray upped its price target on Stemline Therapeutics to $30 from $20 after last week\\'s FDA approval for the company. Jaffray also maintains its Buy rating on this now \\'Tier 3\\' concern. Here is the synopsis of that analyst call. The analyst states that now that pricing has been disclosed at $24.4K in \"wholesale acquisition cost\", his base assumption that the drug will become a standard of care with an estimated launch in early 2019 suggests that the stock is \"significantly undervalued\". His target assumes an \"extremely conservative estimate of 500 BPDCN patients per year\". H.C. Wainwright also reiterated its Buy rating and $38 price target on STML today. Wainwright had this to say about the Black Box warning:\\n It is unlikely that the boxed warning on Elzonris\\' prescription label regarding the increased risk of capillary leak syndrome will deter physicians from prescribing BPDCN patients with the drug, since CLS is largely cycle 1-related and manageable with monitoring and pre-emptive measures, as mentioned at the American Society of Hematology 2018 meeting\" On December 2nd, Roth Capital placed a buy rating on the name and set a price target of $33 a share. The analyst firm saw the shares recovering in light of recent developments. The analyst stated that: We like today\\'s update from the Phase 1/2 study of Elzonris in CMML. Earlier this year after EHA, we had pointed to spleen reduction as a key indicator of clinical benefit, and supportive of eventual approvability. Today\\'s update reinforced this point further by showing us a patient bridged to transplant, which we view as a big deal.\" Verdict: The company has multiple \\'shots on goal\\', upcoming potential catalysts, and is far under the most pessimistic analyst price target. With last week\\'s FDA approval, a major risk has been shelved as well. With the recent pullback within the market carnage in December, Stemline has an attractive risk/reward profile at current trading levels. If you are going to sin, sin against God, not the bureaucracy. God will forgive you but the bureaucracy won\\'t.\" - Hyman G.

There are two 2X-leveraged mREIT-based ETNs sponsored by UBS Group AG (UBS). They are: the UBS ETRACS Monthly Pay 2X Leveraged Mortgage REIT ETN (MORL) and a twin, which is essentially identical in all economic respects, the UBS ETRACS Monthly Pay 2X Leveraged Mortgage REIT ETN Series B (MRRL). There is also another monthly Pay 2X Leveraged Mortgage REIT ETN, the Credit Suisse X-Links Monthly Pay 2x Leveraged Mortgage REIT ETN (REML). MRRL closed at $11.53 on December 24, 2018, which was the lowest close since February 24, 2016. The $20.77 closing price of REML was the all-time low since it began trading on July 13, 2016. The question is should these be bought now, or would that be trying to catch a falling knife? In my March 8, 2017 article: Investing In The Era Of Trump - Do Bad Economic Outcomes Necessarily Mean Bad Investment Outcomes? I said:   ...Even during periods of bad economic outcomes there are some investments that can do well. It may be that the race is not always to the swiftest, nor the fight to the strongest-but that\\'s the way to bet. 1943 Version It may be that a government led by protectionist populists with very little understanding of economics, does not always result bad economic outcomes- but that\\'s the way to invest. 2017 version The famous statement above attributed, in its\\' many forms to various individuals and cited in a 1943 publication as being from Damon Runyon, has an updated 2017 version. One can think of numerous scenarios in which bad economic outcomes result from Trump Administration policies. To be fair, there are some scenarios in which good economic outcomes result from Trump Administration policies. These better outcomes could be considered as being in the \"pulling to an inside straight\" category. There is a stock market adage that good companies can be bad investments and vice versa. For example, Snap Inc. (SNAP) is thought by some to be a good company that may be a poor investment at current levels. It may be that bad economic outcomes, within certain ranges, do not necessarily result in bad outcomes for some investors. Before one can try to determine whether good or bad economic outcomes will result from Trump Administration policies, we have to have to be able have a handle on what those policies are likely to be. Beyond evaluating possible economic outcomes, there then is the question of the implications of various economic outcomes for different securities. A recession is considered a bad economic outcome. However, a recession is generally good for treasury bonds. High inflation is considered a bad economic outcome. However, a high inflation is generally good for gold mining shares. Some economic outcomes such as: widening income inequality or replacing workers with more productive machines might be considered bad economic outcomes by some but the opposite by others... \\n The behavior of the mREITs during the recent market decline appears to be part of the \"sell everything\" phase. As was the case in early 2016, a significant buying opportunity may exist. On January 21, 2016, MORL closed at $9.22. With hindsight, one could say that the January 2016 fears of excessive tightening by the Federal Reserve and credit problems were overblown or even irrational. Now, similar fears mostly focused on the question of the impact of the Federal Reserve tightening that has already taken place might be called overblown or even irrational. Even if that is the case, it\\'s always good to remember, as Keynes famously said: \"The market can stay irrational longer than you can stay solvent.\" Are 2X-Leveraged mREIT-Based ETNs Still Attractive? For those, like me, who already hold 2X-leveraged mREIT-based ETNs, the issue is whether my premise for investing in them since 2012 still intact. My view is that the original premise is still intact. However, since the 2016 election, new risks that were mostly not even on the radar screen have emerged. In 2012, I did not consider the emergence of protectionism a significant possible threat. I also did not think it was likely that the structural Federal deficit would hit an all-time high while unemployment was only 3.7%. That said, I am still a cautious buyer of the 2X-leveraged mREIT-based ETNs. As described in two 2013 Seeking Alpha articles, my macroeconomic rationale for investing in MORL, the only monthly Pay 2X leveraged mREIT ETN in existence at that time, was based on the premise that government policies shifting the tax burden from the rich and onto the middle class results in more funds being available for investment, relative to productive uses for those investable funds. This was elaborated on A Depression With Benefits: The Macro Case For mREITs. The second article published on June 21, 2013, Federal Reserve Actually Propping Up Interest Rates: What This Means For mREITS, set forth a proposition that, contrary to the widely held belief, the Federal Reserve was artificially depressing interest rates. Thus, my view was that it was actually preventing them from falling even more than their then very low levels.\\n Since 2013, the tax code has been changed so that the burden on rich relative to the middle class has been reduced even more. However, the recent election results could possibly result in legislation that might reverse some of what Warren Buffett, CEO of Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.A) (BRK.B), was describing when he said that \"through the tax code, there has been class warfare waged, and my class has won. It\\'s been a rout.\" The aforementioned article published on June 21, 2013, bolstered the case for the mREITS and MORL. My view was that interest rates would stay lower for longer. In 2013, the recovery from the financial crisis that began in 2007 was well underway. Many were forecasting that higher interest rates were imminent. My contrarian view was based in part on my opinion that the Federal Reserve was not artificially depressing short terms risk-free interest rates but rather was prevent them from declining even more. In the June 21, 2013 article, I said:   ...Most investors now believe three things about the Federal Reserve, money and interest rates. They think that the Federal Reserve is artificially depressing rates below what would be a \"normal\" level. They believe that in the process of doing so the Federal Reserve has enormously increased the supply of money and they believe that the USA is on a fiat money system. All three of those beliefs are incorrect...  I updated that article on August 23, 2018, with: Federal Reserve Actually Propping Up Interest Rates: What This Means For mREITs: An Update which presented new evidence supporting my original conclusions that the Federal Reserve has been and still is keeping interest rates higher than what a free market in risk-free short-term fixed-income securities would be. Even if one accepts the premise that the Federal Reserve is keeping interest rates higher than what a free market would result in, there is no reason why the Federal Reserve cannot keep doing so, or even accelerate the rate at which it is raising rates. This is probably one of the most significant risks to the mREITs and especially the 2X leveraged mREIT ETNs. In the category of \"No one is wrong all the time, even a stopped clock is right twice a day\", one could say that however inappropriately President Trump is expressing his views on Federal Reserve policy, his statements that the Federal Reserve has raised rates too much might be correct.\\n Some market observers have expressed opinions that the Federal Reserve may be in the process of making or may already made a policy mistake by raising rates high enough to cause a recession. In theory, the more rapidly that the Federal Reserve raises short-term rates, the more the likelihood of a recession occurring sooner than later. A recession is usually the best time to own mREITs. However, monetary policy and, in particular, the impact of interest rates on economic activity work with long and extremely variable lags. In any case, it\\'s worth repeating, as Keynes famously said: \"The market can stay irrational longer than you can stay solvent.\" Even with some apparent progress regarding a new NAFTA agreement, the risks associated with protectionism still overhang the financial markets. China is particularly worrying. The markets have real reasons to be wary. The imposition of 25% tariffs on goods from China is still a possibility. The various risks relating to trade policy are discussed in Trump\\'s Trade Policies: America\\'s Brexit?  Analysis Of The January 2018 MORL and MRRL Dividend Projection  While typically called dividends, the monthly payments from ETNs are technically distributions of interest payments on the ETN note based on the dividends paid by the underlying components, pursuant to the terms of the indenture. My projected January 2019 MORL and MRRL monthly dividend of $0.5683 is a function of the calendar. Most of the MORL and MRRL components pay dividends quarterly, typically with ex-dates in the last month of the quarter and payment dates in the first month of the next quarter. The January, April, October, and July \"big month\" MORL and MRRL dividends are much larger than the \"small month\" dividends paid in the other months. Thus, the $0.5683 MORL and MRRL dividend paid in January 2019 will be a \"big month\" dividend. As can be seen in the table below, only four of the MORL and MRRL components - AGNC Investment Corp. (AGNC), Colony Credit Real Estate (CLNC), ARMOUR Residential (ARR), and Orchid Island (ORC) - now pay dividends monthly. In 2019 Dynex Capital Inc (DX) will switch from quarterly to monthly dividends. If a component has a December 2018 ex-date, it contributes to the January 2019 dividend. As the table below indicates, every component except for iStar Inc (STAR), will contribute to the dividend paid in January 2019.\\n There were some changes from the prior period that will impact the January 2019 MORL and MRRL monthly dividend. Ladder Capital Corp. (LADR) increased its\\' quarterly dividend to $0.34 from the previous $0.320888. Two Harbors Investment Corp. (TWO) will be paying $0.47 in the 4th quarter of 2018 with an ex-date of December 28, 2018. It also paid $0.47 in the 3rd quarter of 2018. However, the 3rd quarter of 2018 payments consisted of $0.15837 paid with an ex-date of July 24, 2018 and $0.31163 paid with an ex-date of September 28, 2018. Thus, the $0.47 dividend will cause a larger contribution to the \"big month\" January 2019 MORL and MRRL monthly dividend, than the contribution from LADR to the last \"big month\" dividend paid in October 2018. Capstead Mortgage Corp. (CMO) decreased its\\' quarterly dividend to $0.08 from the previous $0.11. Arbor Realty Trust Inc. (ABR) paid a special 4th quarter of 2018 dividend of $0.03 with an ex-date of December 27, 2018. That will contribute to the January 2019 MORL and MRRL monthly dividend. ABR also paid a regular 4th quarter of 2018 dividend of $0.27 with an ex-date of November 14, 2018, which contributed to the December 2018 MORL and MRRL monthly dividend. Thus, while ABR increased its\\' total 4th quarter of 2018 dividends to $0.30 from the prior regular 3rd quarter of 2018 amount of $0.25, only the special dividend will contribute to the January 2019 MORL and MRRL monthly dividend. Anworth Mortgage Asset Corp. (ANH) decreased its\\' quarterly dividend to $0.13 from the previous $0.14. All of the other components that will contribute to the January 2019 MORL and MRRL monthly dividend have the same dividends as in the previous period. My projection for the January 2019 MORL and MRRL monthly dividend of $0.5683 is calculated using the contribution by component method. The table below shows the ticker, name, weight, price, dividend, and ex-date for all of the components. Additionally, the table includes the contribution to the dividend for the MORL and MRRL components that will contribute to the January 2019 MORL and MRRL monthly dividend.\\n The VanEck Vectors Mortgage REIT Income ETF (MORT) is a fund that is based on the same index as MORL and MRRL. MORT pays dividends quarterly rather than monthly. As a fund, the dividend is discretionary by the fund management as long as it distributes the required percentage of taxable income to maintain its investment company status. Thus, it does not lend itself to dividend projections as an ETN like MORL, which must pay dividends pursuant to an indenture. Conclusions And Recommendations MORL and, later, MRRL and REML have been the primary instruments by which I have attempted to utilize my longer-term macroeconomic outlook to manage a high current yield portfolio given some very significant constraints. The most important constraint is to only include securities with current yields above 15%. Other constraints are the typical retail IRA account restrictions which preclude the use of margin borrowing and futures contracts. I suspect that there are many individuals, particularly those either partially or totally retired, who either have somewhat similar constraints or could possibly benefit from adopting them. Given those constraints, the universe of possible investments is very limited. Other than junk bonds and other securities issued by individual distressed entities, in order to meet the 15%+ constraint, my primary investment focus in the quest for 15%+ current yield has been and is on 2x Leveraged High-Yield ETNs. These have included, in addition to MORL and MRRL, REML, the UBS ETRACS Monthly Pay 2x Leveraged Closed-End Fund ETN (CEFL) and the UBS ETRACS 2x Leveraged Long Wells Fargo Business Development Company ETN (BDCL). REML is based on the FTSE NAREIT All Mortgage Capped Index of mREITs. That\\'s the same index used by the iShares Mortgage Real Estate Capped ETF (REM). REML is based on a slightly different index of mREITs than that upon which MRRL and MORL are based. I use REML as a somewhat interchangeable substitute for MRRL and MORL. While MRRL, REML, and MORL are my core holdings, I have utilized CEFL and BDCL as diversifiers and for hedging possible macroeconomic outcomes. A recent addition to my diversifiers was the ETRACS Monthly Pay 2xLeveraged US Small Cap High Dividend ETN (SMHD). It started trading on February 3, 2015. It is based on the Solactive US Small Cap High Dividend Index. The yield on SMHD exceeds both CEFL and BDCL and is only slightly less than MORL.\\n I have taken a small long position in SMHD and recently UBS ETRACS Monthly Pay 2xLeveraged US Small Cap High Dividend ETN Series B (SMHB). One interesting aspect of SMHD and SMHB is that they may be diversifiers for CEFL. This is because closed-end funds are excluded from SMHD. Originally, I looked at SMHD as a diversifier for MORL since SMHD has many equity issues that would do well in an environment of higher levels of economic activity. However, SMHD has a fairly large number of mREITs that are also in MORL. Since SMHD excludes closed-end funds there is no overlap with CEFL. There are some concerns about SMHD and SMHB. The tracking fee is a relatively steep 0.85%, as compared to 0.40% for MORL and 0.50% for CEFL. As with any high yielding instrument, there is usually some reason which it is trading at a level that results in a high yield. Thus, many of the components of that are depressed for various reasons. The two largest components of SMHD are GameStop (GME) and Spirit Realty Capital Inc. (SRC). Both of those components have had some problems in the past year but are still paying relatively large dividends. The components of the Solactive US Small Cap High Dividend Index upon which SMHD and SMHB are based are selected based in part of the security\\'s \"Forward-Looking Distribution Yield,\" which is more useful than historical data, but in some cases involves educated guesses as to what the future dividends will be. On October 09, 2018, UBS announced that it has suspended further sales from inventory of SMHD. That put SMHD in the same category as MORL, in that it can now trade significantly above its indicative (net asset) value. MORL has an essentially identical twin MRRL that is still being created. Until September 6, 2018, MORL and MRRL traded very close to each other and to their net indicative (asset) value which is identical for both. The price relationship between MORL and MRRL changed after September 6, 2018. UBS announced that they would no longer issue any new shares of MORL. The price of MRRL has continued to closely track net asset value since that announcement. However, MORL began trading far above MRRL (and the net asset value of both). The spread between MORL and MRRL eventually widened out to $0.97 on September 17, 2018.\\n This enormous spread prompted my article: Sell MORL, Buy MRRL which included: ..Just because MORL can possibly trade at a significant premium to net asset value does not mean that it should. This is especially true since the identical twin MRRL is still available at very close to net asset value. There may be some sort of a short-squeeze occurring in MORL. These are dangerous to participate in from either side. However, some short-term traders may want to get involved. For investors who own high yielding 2X leveraged ETNs for the very high current yields. If they are making a new purchase, MRRL is a better buy than MORL at present prices. Those that own MORL may want to take advantage of the historic spread and sell MORL and use the proceeds to buy MRRL... The spread between MORL and MRRL narrowed dramatically soon after the article appeared on Seeking Alpha. The spread has bounced around since then, with MORL generally trading higher than MRRL, but not approaching the spread levels seen on Friday, September 17, 2018, and on Monday, September 20, 2018, prior to the article appearing on Seeking Alpha. On December 24, 2018, MORL closed $0.17 higher than MRRL. I am using MRRL\\'s price for yield calculations since that would be the logical one to buy for most investors. When SMHB started trading on November 9, 2018 it presented an arbitrage opportunity similar that existed involving MORL, MRRL, and REM. MRRL and MORL are essentially identical. SMHD and SMHB are based on the same index and thus have identical components. However, their base levels are not identical. Thus, on December 24, 2018, SMHD closed at $12.00 while SMHB closed at $16.98. As with MRRL and MORL, the older version SMHD, which is no longer being sold by UBS, began trading above its\\' net indicative (asset) value, while the new SMHB kept trading very close to net asset value. This prompted my article: Sell SMHD Yielding 21.5%, Buy SMHB Yielding 23.6% that described how to adjust the prices of SMHD and SMHB so that it can be determined by how much SMHB is a better value relative asset value than SMHD at any given time.\\n Since 2012, I have been willing to collect and reinvest the approximately 20% average yield on a monthly compounded basis that MORL and MRRL pay, while the ultimate answers to questions about the outlook for the economy and securities markets are revealed. I still am. When the yields rise above 25% on price declines, as is currently the case, it has been a buying opportunity. My view is that there will likely be more reductions than increases in the Federal Funds rate during the next five years. Furthermore, the possibility exists that Trump\\'s trade policies could precipitate a Lehman collapse like event. In a scenario like that, mREITs and 2X Leveraged ETNs based on mREITS would be one of the best places to be. If you are reading this, you probably are an investor in, or at least a potential investor in 2X Leveraged ETNs such as MORL, MRRL, REML, CEFL, SMHD, SMHB, and BDCL. In my article, \"BDCL: The Third Leg Of The High-Yielding Leveraged ETN Stool,\" I said that BDCL is correlated to the overall stock market but may be a very good diversifier for investors seeking high income who are now heavily invested in interest rate-sensitive instruments. Previously, I pointed out in the article \"17.8%-Yielding CEFL - Diversification On Top Of Diversification, Or Fees On Top Of Fees?\" those investors who have significant portions of their portfolios in mREITs and, in particular, a leveraged basket of mREITs such as MORL, MRRL and REML could benefit from diversifying into an instrument that was correlated to SPY. I still tend to believe that the massive tax-policy-induced increase in inequality will cause increasing excesses of loanable and investable funds, above commercially reasonable ways to utilize those funds. This will eventually result in an overinvestment cycle with a recession, and that will ultimately be very good for the mREITs and 2X Leveraged ETNs based on mREITS. However, there does exist now some possibility that there may be some reversal of the shift in the tax burden away from the rich and onto the middle class as a result of the midterm elections and the Democrats taking control of the House of Representatives. There are other significant risks as well.\\n Taking all of this into consideration, I\\'m still a cautious buyer of 2X Leveraged ETNs based on mREITS and have added to MRRL and REML recently. When one of the UBS 2X Leveraged ETNs based on mREITS can be bought lower than the other one, it would make sense to buy whichever was cheaper. The yields are still compelling. Until September 6, 2018, MRRL, REML and MORL traded very close to their net asset (indicative) values, as MRRL and REML still do. When MORL was trading at a large premium to net asset value, selling MORL and buying REML was a good move. This was particularly relevant for those whose MORL was held at Fidelity, which allows new purchases of REML, but only allows sales of MORL. Now that there is a series B, version of SMHD, I have added some SMHB. It might be noted that while Fidelity does not now allow new purchases of SMHD, it does as of now, allow new purchases of SMHB. It should be kept in mind that economic and policy uncertainty that seems to be diverging rather than converging. This means that significant event risks exist in addition to the risks inherent with the ETNs\\' use of leverage. This is in addition to the leverage employed by many of the components that make up the indices upon which these ETNs are based. There are reasons that one might consider REML rather than the UBS 2X Leveraged ETNs based on mREITS, or vice versa. Even though 2X Leveraged ETNs based on mREITS and REML include mostly similar securities, their portfolios are not identical. REML has more component mREITs than the UBS 2X Leveraged ETNs based on mREITS. Additional diversification considerations are that REML is an obligation of Credit Suisse (CS). It\\'s highly unlikely that either UBS or CS will default in the foreseeable future. However, to the extent one has any concern over those major banks\\' future solvency, holding UBS 2X Leveraged ETNs based on mREITS and REML can provide diversification in that regard. Some have expressed concern regarding the call provisions in ETNs that can be redeemed at net indicative (asset) value if the value falls too low or too quickly. That\\'s not really economic call risk. Since - unlike a call on a bond, where the issuer has the right to buy back the bond at a specified price below the market value that the bond would have without the call - the ability to redeem at net asset value has no intrinsic option value. Some comments in Seeking Alpha articles have asserted that while MORL and MRRL can be called, REML cannot. Fidelity does not allow new purchases of any of the UBS 2X leveraged ETNs such as MORL and MRRL but does allow new purchases REML (for now). Conversations with people at Fidelity seem to have led some to believe that REML cannot be called. This is not correct. As can be seen from the REML prospectus:\\n From RELM prospectus: ..Our Call Right: On any Business Day through and including the Maturity Date, we may, at our option, call all, but not less than all, of the issued and outstanding ETNs. To exercise our Call Right, we must provide notice to the holders of the ETNs (the \"Call Notice\") not less than sixteen (16) calendar days prior to the Call Settlement Date specified in the Call Notice. Upon our call in the event we exercise this right, you will receive a cash payment equal to the Call Settlement Amount, which will be paid on the third Business Day following the Call Valuation Date (the \"Call Settlement Date\")... While all 2X leveraged ETNs have some possibility of early redemption, The possibility is more remote for SMHB than for SMHD. That is possibly why Fidelity allows new purchase of SMHB and not SMHD. As I said above, My calculation projects a January 2019 MORL and MRRL monthly dividend of $0.5683. The implied annualized dividends would be $2.94, based on annualizing the most recent three months, including the January 2019 projection. This is a 25.5% simple annualized yield with MRRL at $11.53. On a monthly compounded annualized basis, it is 28.7%. Aside from the fact that with a yield above 25%, you get back your initial investment in less than five years and still have your original investment shares intact, if someone thought that, over the next five years, interest rates would remain relatively stable, and thus MRRL would continue to yield 28.7% on a compounded basis, the return on a strategy of reinvesting all dividends would be enormous. An investment of $100,000 would be worth $353,480 in five years. More interestingly, for those investing for future income, the income from the initial $100,000 would increase from the $28,700 initial annual rate to $96,574 annually.

The reason for this deal is so that Gilead could gets its hands on another type of technology to target the ever growing NASH fibrosis space. This is another huge commitment for Gilead, because it has spent countless of cash looking for the next blockbuster NASH drug. Massive Partnership Deal The deal centers around a pre-clinical program that is using inhibitors of Transforming growth factor Beta (TGFβ) activation for the treatment of fibrotic diseases. These programs are in the early stages. It will be many years before these products hit at least mid-stage studies. However, I think Gilead may have gone this route because it will have multiple pathways using TGFβ activation to treat patients with fibrotic diseases. These specific functions of the drug are broken down into:  Inhibitors that target activation of latent TGFβ1 with high affinity and specificity  inhibitors that selectively target activation of latent TGFβ1 localized to extracellular matrix  A third TGFβ discovery program  The main focus for SRRK is to develop the drugs in the pre-clinical research phase through product candidate nomination. From there, if Gilead exercises its option for a particular program, it will be able to develop the drug in a preclinical study. It will also be responsible to fully fund the development through other studies, and commercialization costs. As with the focus being fibrotic diseases, more specifically NASH, SRRK makes it out with the ability to target other indications. It will retain the right to still use TGFβ inhibitors for oncology and cancer immunotherapy.\\n Stipulations Of Preclinical Programs Under the terms of this agreement, Gilead only has to pay a total of $80 million as an upfront payment. This breaks down into $50 million in cash and then $30 million as an equity investment into the company. Then if things go well with the preclinical studies, Gilead will also have to pay out a one-time payment of $25 million as well. Ultimately, Gilead may then have to pay out potential milestone payments totaling $1.4 billion. I like the way this deal is structured, and most big pharmaceutical companies tend to offer deals like this one. By good deals, I'm talking about those that have the upfront payment as minimal as possible, between $100 million and $200 million. Then the back end part of the deal, the milestone payments, are where the majority of the cash comes in. The reason why I believe deals like this are good is because it doesn't put a lot of risk for the initiating company. For instance, Gilead only loses $105 million if the trials don't pan out past preclinical studies. If the deal does work out, then Gilead will have no problem eventually paying out $1.4 billion in milestone payments. That's especially true in this case, because the preclinical program deals with fibrotic diseases. Specifically NASH, which is expected to become between a $20 billion and $35 billion market opportunity. That means having to eventually pay up to $1.4 billion in milestones won't seem like much in the long run when the return on investment is expected to be higher. Multiple Shots On Goal The partnership established above between the two pharmaceutical companies proves just how much Gilead wants to establish a foothold in the NASH space. I state this because the company is approaching NASH with multiple trials and multiple combinations. For starters, there are a couple of phase 3 studies reading out in early 2019, using selonsertib to treat patients with NASH. Specifically, the target goal is to go after F3 and F4 fibrosis patients. If you look at all other NASH studies, the population of choice for trial design is the F2 and F3 fibrosis populations (earlier stage NASH). For example, Conatus Pharmaceuticals (CNAT) is taking a different approach after discussions with the FDA. It started off with the F1/F2/F3 population when it designed its study. However, after discussions with the FDA, it was allowed to hit the primary endpoint with either the F1/F2/F3 fibrosis population or the F2/F3 fibrosis population. Conatus expects to release results from its phase 2b NASH study, known as ENCORE-NF, in the 1st half of 2019.\\n For Gilead Sciences, its selonsertib phase 3 trials are risky, but a successful primary endpoint in either one will set up Gilead as being a top contender in the NASH space. Selonsertib is an ASK-1 inhibitor. On another front, Gilead is testing out its very own farnesoid X receptor (FXR) agonist, dubbed GS-9674. The problem with this NASH drug is that its future remains up in the air. That's because in a phase 2 study that Gilead ran with GS-9674, a high dose didn't deliver better results over competing drugs. In essence, 38.8% of patients treated with the high dose of 100 mg obtained a 30% reduction in liver fat compared to placebo. The results were not as promising as expected. Especially, when you put them into context against two competing products. For instance, Intercept Pharmaceuticals (ICPT) has its own FXR agonist known as Ocaliva. When Intercept released its results from its phase 2b FLINT study, the investor community was highly impressed with it. Intercept Pharmaceuticals intends to release interim phase 3 results from its NASH study in the 1st half of 2019. Then Novartis (NVS) has is own FXR agonist, known as tropifexor. Tropifexor was shown to be safer to take compared to GS-9674. In my opinion, the pathway for GS-9674 is not as great as the other NASH prospects for Gilead. That's because Intercept and potentially Novartis may have a better drug. The good news is that at least Gilead is reducing risk by exploring as many combinations as possible. This is especially true when it is pursuing a triple combination therapy for NASH as well. This includes the combination of selonsertib, GS-9674, and an acetyl-CoA carboxylase inhibitor known as GS-0976. This triple combination is risky, but it's possible that it may pan out. It highly depends upon the efficacy of the combination when data is revealed. Another important aspect for such a big combination in my opinion would be safety and tolerability. How this will play out remains to be seen, but I believe it is worth exploring.\\n As much as I would think that solo drugs will take shape in the beginning years of the NASH market, combination therapies are going to end up reigning supreme. From what I have seen thus far, some drugs are good at reducing liver fat content and then others are good at reducing fibrosis. An example of this would be the partnership between Novartis and Allergan (AGN). Back in 2017, both formed a partnership to combine their drugs to treat patients with NASH fibrosis. The phase 2b study is using Allergan's cenicriviroc in combination with Novartis' tropifexor (LJN452) to treat NASH. Allergan's cenicriviroc didn't do well in NASH overall, but in terms of fibrosis, it was very strong in the 1st year measurement. As I noted above, tropifexor is Novartis' FXR agonist. FXR agonists are able to regulate bile acid synthesis. In addition, they are able to regulate lipid metabolism and suppress liver inflammation. As you can see, cenicriviroc is responsible for the fibrosis component of NASH, while tropifexor tackles liver fat and inflammation component of the disease. This combination is being explored in a phase 2b study to determine if it is effective in this patient population. Conclusion Gilead did well to pursue another potential NASH clinical drug program. That's because despite the acquisition of other prior NASH products, it needed to expand even more. The risk is that the TGFβ inhibitors program is very early in clinical development. There is no guarantee that this product will work well in NASH. The good news is that this program may be used for other types of fibrotic diseases. Even then, it wouldn't surprise me to see later on that Gilead combines one of its other NASH drugs with this newly acquired one. The company should be in good shape for now. However, its future in the NASH space in the short term depends upon its selonsertib program which has two late-stage readouts in the 1st half of 2019. On top of that, NASH biotechs don't exist in a vacuum on their own. There are many pharmaceutical companies that are posting their very own NASH results (phase 2/Phase 3) in the 1st half of 2019 as well. Therefore, until everything is released in the early part of 2019, it will be hard to determine which clinical drug is a clear winner in this space. I believe that Gilead is in good shape compared to the other biotechs though because of one reason. That reason being is that it created an extensive NASH pipeline, which in my opinion gives it more shots on goal compared to the other companies.\\n\\nThis article is published by Terry Chrisomalis, who runs the Biotech Analysis Central pharmaceutical service on Seeking Alpha Marketplace.

It will retain the right to still use TGFβ inhibitors for oncology and cancer immunotherapy.\\n Stipulations Of Preclinical Programs Under the terms of this agreement, Gilead only has to pay a total of $80 million as an upfront payment. This breaks down into $50 million in cash and then $30 million as an equity investment into the company. Then if things go well with the preclinical studies, Gilead will also have to pay out a one-time payment of $25 million as well. Ultimately, Gilead may then have to pay out potential milestone payments totaling $1.4 billion. I like the way this deal is structured, and most big pharmaceutical companies tend to offer deals like this one. By good deals, I'm talking about those that have the upfront payment as minimal as possible, between $100 million and $200 million. Then the back end part of the deal, the milestone payments, are where the majority of the cash comes in. The reason why I believe deals like this are good is because it doesn't put a lot of risk for the initiating company. For instance, Gilead only loses $105 million if the trials don't pan out past preclinical studies. If the deal does work out, then Gilead will have no problem eventually paying out $1.4 billion in milestone payments. That's especially true in this case, because the preclinical program deals with fibrotic diseases. Specifically NASH, which is expected to become between a $20 billion and $35 billion market opportunity. That means having to eventually pay up to $1.4 billion in milestones won't seem like much in the long run when the return on investment is expected to be higher. Multiple Shots On Goal The partnership established above between the two pharmaceutical companies proves just how much Gilead wants to establish a foothold in the NASH space. I state this because the company is approaching NASH with multiple trials and multiple combinations. For starters, there are a couple of phase 3 studies reading out in early 2019, using selonsertib to treat patients with NASH. Specifically, the target goal is to go after F3 and F4 fibrosis patients. If you look at all other NASH studies, the population of choice for trial design is the F2 and F3 fibrosis populations (earlier stage NASH). For example, Conatus Pharmaceuticals (CNAT) is taking a different approach after discussions with the FDA. It started off with the F1/F2/F3 population when it designed its study. However, after discussions with the FDA, it was allowed to hit the primary endpoint with either the F1/F2/F3 fibrosis population or the F2/F3 fibrosis population. Conatus expects to release results from its phase 2b NASH study, known as ENCORE-NF, in the 1st half of 2019.\\n For Gilead Sciences, its selonsertib phase 3 trials are risky, but a successful primary endpoint in either one will set up Gilead as being a top contender in the NASH space. Selonsertib is an ASK-1 inhibitor. On another front, Gilead is testing out its very own farnesoid X receptor (FXR) agonist, dubbed GS-9674. The problem with this NASH drug is that its future remains up in the air. That's because in a phase 2 study that Gilead ran with GS-9674, a high dose didn't deliver better results over competing drugs. In essence, 38.8% of patients treated with the high dose of 100 mg obtained a 30% reduction in liver fat compared to placebo. The results were not as promising as expected. Especially, when you put them into context against two competing products. For instance, Intercept Pharmaceuticals (ICPT) has its own FXR agonist known as Ocaliva. When Intercept released its results from its phase 2b FLINT study, the investor community was highly impressed with it. Intercept Pharmaceuticals intends to release interim phase 3 results from its NASH study in the 1st half of 2019. Then Novartis (NVS) has is own FXR agonist, known as tropifexor. Tropifexor was shown to be safer to take compared to GS-9674. In my opinion, the pathway for GS-9674 is not as great as the other NASH prospects for Gilead. That's because Intercept and potentially Novartis may have a better drug. The good news is that at least Gilead is reducing risk by exploring as many combinations as possible. This is especially true when it is pursuing a triple combination therapy for NASH as well. This includes the combination of selonsertib, GS-9674, and an acetyl-CoA carboxylase inhibitor known as GS-0976. This triple combination is risky, but it's possible that it may pan out. It highly depends upon the efficacy of the combination when data is revealed. Another important aspect for such a big combination in my opinion would be safety and tolerability. How this will play out remains to be seen, but I believe it is worth exploring.\\n As much as I would think that solo drugs will take shape in the beginning years of the NASH market, combination therapies are going to end up reigning supreme. From what I have seen thus far, some drugs are good at reducing liver fat content and then others are good at reducing fibrosis. An example of this would be the partnership between Novartis and Allergan (AGN). Back in 2017, both formed a partnership to combine their drugs to treat patients with NASH fibrosis. The phase 2b study is using Allergan's cenicriviroc in combination with Novartis' tropifexor (LJN452) to treat NASH. Allergan's cenicriviroc didn't do well in NASH overall, but in terms of fibrosis, it was very strong in the 1st year measurement. As I noted above, tropifexor is Novartis' FXR agonist. FXR agonists are able to regulate bile acid synthesis. In addition, they are able to regulate lipid metabolism and suppress liver inflammation. As you can see, cenicriviroc is responsible for the fibrosis component of NASH, while tropifexor tackles liver fat and inflammation component of the disease. This combination is being explored in a phase 2b study to determine if it is effective in this patient population. Conclusion Gilead did well to pursue another potential NASH clinical drug program. That's because despite the acquisition of other prior NASH products, it needed to expand even more. The risk is that the TGFβ inhibitors program is very early in clinical development. There is no guarantee that this product will work well in NASH. The good news is that this program may be used for other types of fibrotic diseases. Even then, it wouldn't surprise me to see later on that Gilead combines one of its other NASH drugs with this newly acquired one. The company should be in good shape for now. However, its future in the NASH space in the short term depends upon its selonsertib program which has two late-stage readouts in the 1st half of 2019. On top of that, NASH biotechs don't exist in a vacuum on their own. There are many pharmaceutical companies that are posting their very own NASH results (phase 2/Phase 3) in the 1st half of 2019 as well. Therefore, until everything is released in the early part of 2019, it will be hard to determine which clinical drug is a clear winner in this space. I believe that Gilead is in good shape compared to the other biotechs though because of one reason. That reason being is that it created an extensive NASH pipeline, which in my opinion gives it more shots on goal compared to the other companies.\\n\\nThis article is published by Terry Chrisomalis, who runs the Biotech Analysis Central pharmaceutical service on Seeking Alpha Marketplace.

It\\'s still not a buy. More important than valuation is revenue and earnings trends and the risk to Street earnings estimates. I plan to take you through Apple\\'s numbers and fundamental drivers to show you the Street\\'s still probably too high. Let\\'s review. Apple Guidance Not Conservative In a report we did mid November on Apple we said the following, \"I don\\'t think they are being conservative. That purported conservatism is not a reason to step up to the stock.\" Their guidance for the December quarter implied a huge slowdown in revenue growth. We went through each item in that report to show that Apple was not being conservative. Here\\'s that big slowdown in revenues. They guided to $89-$93B for the December quarter. Here\\'s how it looks in the model.              Sept Dec Mar Jun Sept Dec    Q4 Q1 Q2 Q3 Q4 Q1E   Fiscal 2017 2018 2018 2018 2018 2019   Calendar 2017 2017 2018 2018 2018 2018   Co Revs 52579 88293 61137 53265 62900 91000   Growth 12.2% 12.7% 15.6% 17.3% 19.6% 3.1%   2 Year Gr 3.2% 16.0% 20.2% 24.5% 31.9% 15.8%    Source: Elazar Advisors models using data from Apple\\'s earnings releases While the September quarter was blow-out their guide of $91B (midpoint) assumes a 3% growth rate for the December quarter. That\\'s a monster slowdown from September. We look at the two-year revenue growth rate which takes this year\\'s revenue growth plus last year\\'s same-quarter revenue growth. It tends to smooth out year-ago quarters that have one-time factors. Looking at the two-year. Apple\\'s guide assumes a material slowdown from September\\'s 31.9% growth rate. To model revenues, because we saw the two-year trend start to slow, we have to assume it\\'s going to continue to slow. Besides just modeling the trend we review key factors below that would tell us the slowing trend can continue. That slowing revenue trend is a key driver to earnings downside in coming quarters.\\n Here\\'s the way we\\'d model the revenues.                   Sept Dec Mar Jun Sept Dec Mar Jun Sept Dec    Q4 Q1 Q2 Q3 Q4 Q1E Q2E Q3E Q4E Q1E   Fiscal 2017 2018 2018 2018 2018 2019 2019 2019 2019 2020   Calendar 2017 2017 2018 2018 2018 2018 2019 2019 2019 2019   Co Revs 52579 88293 61137 53265 62900 91000 60747 51506 58730 99130   Growth 12.2% 12.7% 15.6% 17.3% 19.6% 3.1% -0.6% -3.3% -6.6% 8.9%   2 Year Gr 3.2% 16.0% 20.2% 24.5% 31.9% 15.8% 15.0% 14.0% 13.0% 12.0%    Source: Elazar Advisors models using data from Apple\\'s earnings releases Really we should slow the two-year revenue growth rate more aggressively since September\\'s 31.9% slowed from 24.5% and their guide slowed at a faster rate. Still we represent the slowdown in the model and it\\'s already below Street estimates. Our revenue estimates for the coming guided quarter are about $3-4B below the Street. If correct, even with the stock \"cheap\" as we\\'ll show below you still have earnings risk ahead which can weigh on the stock. Reasons For Revenue Risk? Emerging Markets, Dollar, China Emerging Markets On Apple\\'s last earnings call the company called out emerging markets weakness. \"...we also face some macroeconomic uncertainty, particularly in emerging markets.\" Macro estimates for emerging markets appear to be dropping. Speaking to the company we think emerging markets make up about one-third of Apple\\'s business. If emerging markets continue to slow that gives us extra reason to believe our revenue model above can show continued slower growth rates. The Dollar Here\\'s the dollar. \\n\\nSource The dollar matters for two reasons. One, a higher dollar lowers their foreign revenues as they translate that foreign currency back into dollars. Secondly, so that they don\\'t get a big hit to margins and revenues, when foreign currencies drop they tend to raise retail prices. Raising prices offsets the weaker currency for reporting. But raising prices also hurts demand.\\n So the dollar has a double whammy. As you see in the chart above we marked where the dollar sat when they last gave guidance. It hasn\\'t moved much (maybe a touch higher) which means these factors don\\'t improve. High Apple product prices should continue to slow emerging market consumer demand and continue to drag revenues. China China was about 18% of revenues last quarter. So between emerging markets plus China you have about half of the company\\'s revenues. What concerns us is that China was not mentioned as a soft spot in their weak guidance last quarter. Given the macro slowdown in China I would guess that\\'s another shoe to drop come this or next quarter. It could be the newest reason for a continued slower revenue growth trend in the coming quarters. Here\\'s the slowing China retail sales numbers. \\n\\nSource Apple can surely be affected by these slowing retail spending numbers. There also are reports of shrinking consumer confidence in China. Buying high-ticket phones may not be top on the consumer agenda. As an added twist companies in China in support of Huawei after the arrest of their CFO are pushing employees not to buy Apple products. Companies have encouraged purchases away from Apple, sometimes subsidizing up to 100% of the phone. That can\\'t help Apple sales. Apple Stock May Be Cheap But There\\'s Still Earnings Risk We are about inline for earnings for this quarter but our model (see full model: pay wall) has lower earnings than the Street for the next few quarters. Here\\'s our earnings vs. the Street.            Dec Mar Jun Sept    Q1E Q2E Q3E Q4E   Street EPS 4.66 2.96 2.43 3.00   Our Upside -0.02 -0.15 -0.35 -0.44    To get to these numbers we pretty much kept gross margins about the same in future quarters as they just guided. We ran R&D and SG&A growth rates similar to the company\\'s implied December quarter guidance.\\n We also accelerate the share buyback a bit. Still our EPS estimates based on our slower revenue growth falls below the Street for the next few quarters. Valuation Looks Cheap Our process uses the midpoint of the last few years PE range to decide on a valuation. It\\'s easy to talk yourself into buying anything by using any PE you want. We let the market decide what PE to pay. As we said, where there\\'s PE history, we use the midpoint. Here\\'s Apple\\'s PE range. \\n\\nSource Apple\\'s PE has ranged between 10 and 20. We\\'d use the mid-point of 15. Our calendar 2019 (fiscal March 2020) EPS estimate is $13.42 (see full model: pay wall) vs. the Street\\'s $14.64. First, we\\'d never recommend a stock where our earnings estimates are below the Street. That\\'s one. Earnings risk is stock price risk. Who wants that? But using a 15 PE on that $13.42 you\\'d get a price target of about $201 which is 32% 12-month upside potential from where it sits today. But Not 2-1 Risk/Reward Potential, So Not For Us Still, for us, our buys need to have at least 45% 12-month upside potential. Stocks are down huge, as we know. And if you\\'ve read any of my stuff you know that I\\'ve said stocks easily have 20% downside over any shorter-term period. So without a 45%-plus upside rule you are accepting less than a 2-1 risk/reward. Apple does not meet that 2-1 minimum risk/reward criteria. Personally, Wall Street brokerage firms that issue 10%-20% upside targets on Strong Buys are a joke. They are telling you the risk/reward is terrible, sub-1. So even though there\\'s 32% upside to our numbers, we don\\'t have what we need that would qualify it for a buy, namely we have risk to street estimates and less than 2-1 risk/reward. Conclusion There\\'s no argument that Apple is a great company. However, as we warned in November, growth rates have been slowing down. We\\'d expect there are continued headwinds that can continue that slowing trend. That slowing trend can drive earnings risk which would mean stock risk when they report in late January/early February.\\n\\nJoin Us\\nWe\\'re raising prices January 15, 2019, ahead of next earnings season.

The Only Real Player Of the two major exchanges in the United States, the NYSE is by far the biggest (with a total market cap of $23.2 trillion) compared with the NASDAQ (with a total market cap closer to approximately $10 trillion). There\\'s no doubt that there\\'s certainly some degree of prestige associated with being listed on the New York Exchange in comparison with the NASDAQ, with no physical presence. The NASDAQ is undoubtedly the best low-fee exchange for smaller companies and those naturally attracted to an electronic exchange (such as internet companies). However, the New York Exchange was founded in 1792, and will very likely continue to be the home of long-term oriented stocks, in contrast with the growth-focussed listings on the NASDAQ. Fundamentally, they are also different types of equity market. To compare the NYSE-operated auction market with the NASDAQ-operated dealer market is not a valid comparison. Both have their separate purposes, target market and operating procedures, and both are essentially monopolies in their own corner of the financial exchange market. Ultimately, companies wanting to be publicly listed will choose one of the two main exchanges. For these companies, it makes much more sense to trade on a large, liquid exchange rather than any unproven and likely very illiquid potential competitor. This definitely scares off any serious competition for the two major exchanges the way things currently operate. \\n Fees In Every Market Environment One of the best aspects of owning a stock exchange is that even in a bear market, as long as transactions are occurring, the company is entitled to take their commission. According to its 2017 income statement, ICE was able to generate $5.83 billion in transaction fees, and has increased this figure significantly since 2013 (when it earned just $1.8 billion from equivalent commissions). \\n\\nICE Gross Profit (Annual) data by YChartsStrong Fundamentals Despite being a virtual monopoly, which one might imagine would attract large numbers of investors, Intercontinental Exchange is also very attractive on the basis of financial ratios and valuation. The company has a P/E ratio of just 15.9x, competitive versus the S&P 500 average P/E of around 18x. Its defensively low price-to book ratio of around 2.4x demonstrates that it is a value (as well as a growth) stock. It is very asset-heavy as a result of requiring all of the physical infrastructure for the exchange - this arguably also provides a margin of safety for investors. As an added bonus, the company also pays a dividend, currently at a yield of 1.36%.  What About Blockchain? One could certainly introduce the question of whether centralised exchanges like the NYSE might soon be replaced by a decentralised blockchain-driven solution. Honestly, this does seem unlikely. Blockchain has to a degree proved its efficacy for the transfer of money (through Bitcoin). Though stock markets are a relatively simple concept, the question to be asked is who would start this blockchain solution for trading equities? The technology on which Bitcoin is based is great for sending imaginary money to anonymous people. For trading real shares in real companies, the blockchain solution is at best unproven.\\n Even if blockchain technology is somehow eventually responsible for managing the market, it seems highly likely that Intercontinental Exchange would be involved in some way. The company has certainly demonstrated its enthusiasm for these new technologies by establishing Bakkt, described as \"an open, seamless global network to enable you to buy, sell, store and spend digital assets simply, safely and efficiently\". Conclusion Intercontinental Exchange operates in a market where competition is virtually impossible due to the scale of infrastructure and trust required to be able to set up a competing stock exchange. For this reason, it would be fair to call it a monopoly. It\\'s also a monopoly which can choose how much to charge on the millions of daily transactions which it handles through the exchanges it is responsible for running. For this reason, Intercontinental Exchange looks set to be a long-term success. Investing a proportion of your portfolio in the company with a view to making significant gains over the next 10-20 years would appear to be an excellent idea.\\nDisclosure: I/we have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

With shares losing another 2.6% on Monday, the name is just under a critical dividend point. Since Apple restarted its capital return program earlier this decade, the board and management have prioritized share repurchases. That has led to a slow and methodical increase in the dividend, which has frustrated investors at times. The dividend has gone from roughly 38 cents a quarter in 2012 (adjusted for the stock split) to 73 cents now, but nobody really thinks of Apple as a high-yielding name. The recent fall in the stock has changed the dividend situation in a big way in recent months, as seen in the chart below. \\n\\nAt its all-time high with a valuation of more than a trillion dollars, Apple's annual dividend yield was just 1.25%. At Monday's intra-day low, shares were just 59 cents from $146, at which point the $2.92 annual payout hits 2%. The name is approaching the top half of the S&P 500 when it comes to dividend yields, but it may not get there until we see another payout raise. With US interest rates rising in the last year or two, investors were certainly looking elsewhere to find interest income. If you could get a 10-Year Treasury at a 3% yield, that would provide basically twice as much annual income as Apple was. However, with the fall in Apple shares combined with a flight to safety in US Treasuries recently, the gap between the two has narrowed from 192 basis points to just 76 basis points in recent months.\\n \\n\\n (Data for this chart and one above sourced from Yahoo! Finance) The way things have been going in this market, the gap could easily be down to 50 basis points by the end of the year. Unfortunately, that's probably not something long investors want to hear since it likely means markets continue to plunge. Still, the overall point is clear, and that's Apple is a much better income generator than it was just a couple of months ago. Of course, this doesn't tell the entire story. Apple has made three payouts at the current level so far, meaning the one in Q1 2019 should be the last at this dividend rate. When we get the fiscal Q2 earnings report in late April or early May, investors will be expecting a capital return plan update, including a likely dividend raise. The good news is that with the buyback increasing at a significant pace in recent quarters, fiscal 2018 saw the biggest yearly decline in the ending outstanding share count as seen below. \\n\\n(Source: Apple 10-K filings, seen here) This year's dividend raise was nearly 16%, so I would figure we'd see at least that much in 2019 given the sharp reduction in the share count. That means investors could receive $3.30, $3.50, or even more over the next 12 months with three payments coming at the higher rate. That would mean a forward annual yield that could be 2.25%, depending on the dividend raise. This also makes the buyback more important when looking at overall cash flow and capital returns.\\n While Apple has never been known as a high yielder, the fall in shares over the last couple of months has made the dividend situation a bit more intriguing. Shares closed Monday just under the point where the name yields 2% on an annual basis, and investors are likely to receive even more than that moving forward based on an expected dividend raise. With the gap between Treasuries and Apple's yield down quite a bit, investors looking for income may start looking at the technology giant.

Click here to find out more »\\nThe recent third quarter earnings call for Duluth Trading Company (DLTH) caused the stock to take a significant slide. There have been substantial blips in the stock price after starting at a $12 IPO, but if you can stomach the turmoil is this stock one to hold for the long haul? Compelling Story Duluth has built its brand around durable and comfortable clothing that can be used both at a job site and as casual clothing. Although their clothes have history based in work apparel, Duluth has been increasing the breadth of their offerings to widen their customer base into a more diverse spread of age, gender, and clothing sizes. Two other popular competitors in this market are Dickies and Carhartt, both offering durable workwear and casual apparel. Both of these companies are privately owned, but their merchandise is sold through many distributors. Duluth is unique from its competitors by being the exclusive seller to consumers consisting of a multi-channel sales strategy that is based on traditional brick-and-mortar retail, online sales through their website, and mailed catalogs. This allows Duluth to control the consumer facing marketing and to shape a high quality customer experience through customized in-store experiences and remote customer service. The clothing is backed by a guarantee, which I believe increases the perception of quality to customers over other brands of clothing that do not have the same guarantee. As seen in the below data from the 10-Q filed 12/7/2018, the first three quarters of 2018 saw direct net sales increase by 6.5% over the same period in 2017, while the retail net sales increased by 67% from the first three quarters of 2017 to 2018. The significant increase in retail sales is due to Duluth continuing to reinvest into opening new stores, and shows that they are able to continue significant retail growth in this area despite overall retail having an overall negative sentiment. I believe that the growth in their direct sales shows that their marketing is working to bring in new customers, not simply having their retail stores poach off of existing direct customers.\\n \\n\\nSource: Duluth 10-Q Filed Dec. 7, 2018 Earnings Q3 earnings per share consensus was -0.10 and Duluth delivered right on consensus at -0.10. Despite this, the stock took a nosedive from around $30 to around $23. Let us take a closer look at the earnings. The graph below shows actual EPS data in blue from prior earnings reports and future consensus EPS estimates for the next five fiscal quarters in yellow. Duluth has a highly seasonal business model, with Q4 far outweighing Q1-Q3 earnings per share typically and the consensus continues this trend with additional growth into the future. Trading at current price of $23.50, the trailing twelve month P/E is 37.3, which does appear high for a retail store. However I think it is necessary to factor in the future growth of Duluth as a more relevant statistic to look at for this company. Looking at the next 4 quarters, from Q4 2018 to Q3 2019, finds a forward looking P/E ratio of 25.8 based on today's stock price, which I see being helped by a healthy holiday shopping season. Going forward to FY2019, from Q1 2019 to Q4 2019, finds even higher estimated earnings from next year's holiday shopping season and a P/E estimate of 22.8. \\n\\n Data source: Duluth Holdings Inc. Earnings Forecast, Graph: Author original I believe that early reports from this holiday shopping season help to back up these estimates. The Mastercard SpendingPulse report shows the strongest holiday shopping season ever with 5.1% growth overall. Reading deeper into the report shows growth in the apparel category of 7.9% over last year's holiday season. Other reports also concur with this sentiment, and I think that these reports help to bolster confidence that Duluth can deliver on the estimates in Q4.\\n Continued Growth Looking at the below chart that tracks Percent Change in Revenue, the holiday season is clearly visible again in the Q4 results each year. However, it is the percent change in capital expenditures that shows the reason to believe the continued growth of Duluth that was outlined above. For the last three years, Q2 and Q3 has shown a large increase in capital expenditure by the company as it continues to build out its retail stores. In Q4 2017, revenue showed more growth than in the previous years due to that expansion. Again this year, in Q2 and Q3, Duluth has increased its capital expenditures to build out more stores throughout the year. As it has in past years, I believe that the continued expansion this year will have prepared Duluth to capitalize on this year's holiday season and show increased revenue over the previous fiscal years. \\n\\nSource: Data by YCharts I think there are a few new initiatives that should be highlighted that CEO Stephanie Pugliese tucked into the middle of her most recent earnings call. Duluth had implemented the ability to order online and pick up in store has been rolled out to a few stores that Stephanie reported to have garnered enough positive feedback to roll out further in 2019 according to the earnings call transcript. Also it was reported that electronic gift cards are now available; I believe there may be an uptick in overall gift card sales because this makes it more likely for a person to give a gift card to Duluth during this holiday season compared to having to order one and have it shipped. Risks One of Duluth's biggest risks would appear to be the increases in SG&A expenses. In the 2018 Q3 filing, SG&A expenses for Q3 were reported as $63.5 million, whereas for Q3 2017, SG&A was reported as $48 million, an increase of 32.3% year over year for the same period. In the same filing, gross profit was only up 28.6% for the same period year over year. However, I believe that if we compare the SG&A as a percentage of net sales for the last few years, it tells a different story. Although the expenses are increasing, they are driving growth in net sales, and maintaining at a very consistent level year over year as a percentage of the net sales.\\n For the last several years Duluth has been opening many new stores per year, but as Duluth continues expansion, I see the SG&A expenses as a percent of net sales leveling off and perhaps even decreasing within the next several years for several reasons. Duluth currently operates 40 stores including 12 new stores opened in the first 9 months of 2018; even if Duluth continues to open new stores at this rate, the expense of opening new stores will decrease as a percent of retail store revenue. Additionally, Duluth's distribution center both for shipping retail and direct shipping may be able to recognize greater efficiency due to economies of scale as the company continues to grow. \\n\\n Data source: Duluth 10-Q filings Dec. 7, 2018, Dec. 7, 2017, Dec. 9, 2016, Dec. 18, 2015 Risks for the industry ride largely on consistent habits in consumer spending for the clothing and footwear category. The US Bureau of Economic Analysis shows good performance for consumer spending in clothing and footwear for 2017 to date in 2018. The graph below derived from data from the US Bureau of Economic Analysis December 21, 2018, update shows in each of the previous 7 quarters, consumer spending (PCE) has been growing at fairly consistent quarter over quarter growth. Looking closer at the clothing and footwear category, growth in this area outpaced overall consumer spending for 5 of the last 7 quarters, and often showing double digit growth from the previous quarter. \\n\\n\\n \\n\\n Data source: US Bureau of Economic Analysis, Graph: Author original Bottom Line: Buy Now to Prepare for Future Growth After reporting Q3 earnings, Duluth stock took a significant hit. The horizon might be a little longer to see the full benefit of the combined retail and online sales channel strategy compared to some growth stocks, but since this company is positioned for continued growth in the future, I think the dip in stock price presents a good opportunity to increase holdings ahead of the company's growth in the next few years.\\nDisclosure: I am/we are long DLTH.

Keane Group, (FRAC) is a fairly recent entry that has shaken up the frack-patch with their growth since 2016. Recently they did something that has been missing in the OFS sector for a couple of quarters now. They affirmed revenue guidance for Q-4, and went a step further by increasing EBITDA guidance. Many companies are lowering guidance and then missing those new, lower numbers. Even for FRAC this is admittedly off significantly from Q-3, a sign of the budget exhaustion and seasonal slowing that other companies have noted. And, surely part of the reason FRAC has sold off to the extent it has this quarter. \\n\\n SOURCE The stock has been consistently brought down by the various factors that have dogged the shale story this year. Factors that do not appear to have stopped or even slowed them down in a relentless quest to frack America. With improvement forecast for Q-1, I think FRAC could be putting in a bottom here and am going to take a hard look at taking a position. That would make it a Value play. Let\\'s look closer. Thesis With solid service and a strong management team, Keane has managed to transcend what I have called \"Little Fracker\" status, by taking market share from the big guys with quality accounts. One of the things that intrigues me about the company, and has me considering taking a starter position is their dominance with some key shale players.\\n \\n\\n Source This is pretty good stuff, and I should give a shout-out to PapaWhisky (a frequent commenter on my public articles) for posting it in comments on a prior article. It represents some nice legwork by Rystad to mine this data. What the 2018 bar tells us is that FRAC has lined up about half of the frac capex from three of shale\\'s big players. One of the concerns about shale, and it is a legitimate one, is that the banks are going to start shutting down lending to shale frackers due to the price declines in oil. Shell, (RDS.A, RDS.B) ExxonMobil, (XOM), and Chevron, (CVX) could not care less about what the shale lenders do. They fund their capex from cash flow and, (this is key) have made irrevocable decisions to grow production via shale in 2019. There\\'s no going back for these guys, frack they will regardless of current fluctuations in the WTI price. \\n\\n Source With modern technology and, ...some REALLY talented engineering horse power (I am not sure what the senior managers at the Big Colors ((the larger service companies)) think happens to the employees they lay off but, here\\'s a clue, they go to work for companies like FRAC!), small companies can compete on a technical level with the best of the Big Colors. Sure there are gaps, but they are little gaps that are not noticeable by the client base. When you add the ubiquity of technology and high-horsepower engineering talent to the low cost position Keane has assembled, you have a very appealing value proposition for the blue chip clients they have assembled. So, I am opening the gate and letting Keane Group out of the \"little fracker\" corral.\\n Market position as a low cost aggregator In the space of just a little over seven years (7) in the market place Keane has built a sizable frac fleet of 1.4 mm HHP spread across the various key shale plays. \\n\\n Source \\n\\n The slide above is pretty detailed so I won\\'t embellish a great deal. One thing worth noting is their expansion through acquisition. Buying top quality assets with an existing customer base is one of the best models in the oilfield for growth. It brings hard assets, (pumps) usually at a price discounted to retail, and a pool of talented people who are familiar with the area and its client base. An example would be 2017\\'s acquisition of Rockpile for an equivalent of $1,000 per HHP, or about $20 mm for a 20K horse power frac spread. Then they dropped it to ~400 HHP in the RSI pick up. It\\'s also important to point out that Keane rounds out its services with logging, cementing, sand logistics, and surfactant technology. These multiple service offerings can contribute nicely to revenue and margin gained per rig. Top Flight Senior Management Team The two top guys James Stewart and Robert Drummond have lengthy Schlumberger, (SLB) backgrounds. I will focus on Robert Drummond, CEO Keane Group as I know of him personally. Drummond was my boss\\'s, boss\\'s, boss\\'s, boss\\'s, boss\\'s, boss\\'s boss when I was with SLB in North America. (There may have been a few more layers of management between us...after all, this is SLB we\\'re talking about). As President of SLB\\'s North American division prior to becoming CEO of Key Energy Group, he knows all the equivalent heads at the key blue chip accounts in North America. He can pick up the phone and call the President of Chevron North America, and get him/her. Not everyone can do that. There\\'s nothing that helps close a deal like a personal relationship at the top levels.\\n I also like the Key Energy experience he brings. Key is a well servicer that has struggled over the years, but now seems to be regrouping. Drummond was brought in to replace their former long time Chairman and CEO, Dick Alario. Key at the time was being investigated by the SEC for questionable activities, which crushed the stock and lead to a delisting by the NYSE, and eventual bankruptcy filing. Helping to heal a company like Key is great experience for a manager with Drummond\\'s SLB background. Drummond\\'s Bio-  Mr. Drummond joined Keane in August 2018 as Chief Executive Officer. He holds a B.S. in Petroleum Engineering from the University of Alabama, and during his career has earned a wealth of experience in positions of leadership across the energy industry. Prior to joining Keane, Mr. Drummond served as the President & Chief Executive Officer of Key Energy Services, Inc. and served for more than 30 years at Schlumberger Limited in various executive positions, including President of North America, Vice President & General Manager U.S. Land, Vice President of Global Sales, Vice President General Manager U.S. Gulf of Mexico, and President North American Offshore and Alaska. Mr. Drummond has been a Supervisory Director at Frank’s International N.V. since May 2017, and sits on the board of directors of the Petroleum Equipment Suppliers Association and the advisory board for the University of Alabama College of Engineering. He has previously served on the board of directors of the National Ocean Industries Association, the Houston Offshore Energy Center, the Greater Houston Partnership, the API Upstream Committee, and as an Advisory Board Member of the University of Houston Global Energy Management Institute. Source  That\\'s not gravitas on a scale with the Dos Equis guy, but he\\'s a heavy-hitter none the less. Financials Keane sports a relatively clean sheet. Through Q-3 revenue is up over the same period last year, while EBIDTA is off, but they are still generating free cash, of almost $30 mm for Q-3. What\\'s killing the stock is the Q-4 guidance along with the continued price drop in oil.\\n \\n\\n Source Debt is a bit higher than their cohort group, but manageable at a D/E ratio of 0.67, with no huge maturities in the near term. By comparison ProPetro, (PUMP), and Liberty Oilfield Services, (LBRT), are at 0.16 and 0.14 respectively. \\n\\n Source I am impressed with the entire group actually, FRAC, LBRT, PUMP. Debt is what sinks small OFS companies when a market contracts or levels off. It seems to me that the management in the whole group is behaving like adults and managing their businesses to thrive in any environment. Q-4 Guidance As I noted earlier Keane is subject to the same industry macrotrends that have crushed OFS stocks this year. They have paid the price, to my mind somewhat out of proportion to others in their cohort. But, perhaps that creates opportunity going forward. Keane\\'s CFO on Q-4 guidance  For the fourth quarter, our assets will be comprised of 29 fleets, of which we expect 25 to be deployed. Of these 25 deployed fleets, we expect to achieve utilization of approximately 90%, driven by white space in the frac calendar, resulting in the equivalent of 22 fully-utilized fleets for the quarter. On this base, total revenue is expected to range between $470 million and $500 million. We expect annualized adjusted gross profit per fleet for the third quarter to range between $16 million and $18 million. Included in these numbers is approximately $15 million of labor and maintenance cost associated with keeping the bulk of our capacity hot so that when the market picks up, we\\'re ready to go. So when looking at our fourth quarter, if it were representative of a prolonged period, we would right-size and believe Keane would generate approximately $90 million of adjusted EBITDA per quarter. Source \\n My comments-  Revenue certainly reflects a softening market, down about 15% from Q-3. As this is a general trend in the industry, I choose not to read too much into this factor. EBIDTA is down naturally as a result as well for the same reasons. The bright spot here is equipment will be maintained in a ready to go status to take advantage of a forecast pick up in activity.  Technicals \\n\\n Source Fidelity Active Trader Pro The green flags at the far right indicate an improvement in near term prospects, likely due to the extreme sell off seen in the past couple of months. Risks The key risk I see in Keane is that they are a pure play North American fracker. If something were to impact that story their shares would suffer. Perhaps even more than they already have so far in 2018. That is a risk that\\'s hard to assess as the frack story seems to be gathering momentum in the face of declining oil prices as we head into 2019. Currently Baker shows us to be at 1080 rigs nationwide, up 9 from the prior week. I think their blue chip client base insulates them somewhat from volatility in this sector. \\n\\n Source Your takeaway At this writing, WTI has sunk below $45, so it looks like Santa is skipping the oilfield this Christmas. Darn the luck. Still life and the pursuit of growth goes on! I\\'ll be honest, I wasn\\'t prepared to find a company in as good a shape as Keane seems to be to survive a temporary flattening of the growth curve. I don\\'t think their current price of ~8.00 is anywhere near reflective of their prospects. I haven\\'t mentioned this yet, but they are also buying back $100 mm of their stock which should add support to the stock in the coming year. As of Q-3 they had accomplished ~40 mm of this goal.\\n Their reaffirmation of the Q-4 revenue and EBITDA guidance noted previously suggests to me they have a good handle on their customer base\\'s plans. With an EV/EBITDA ratio of 2.98 as of today. For reference the cohorts are shown in the graph below. \\n\\n Source: Seeking Alpha, Chart by author I really haven\\'t uncovered a reason for FRAC to trade at such a discount to its peer group. FRAC\\'s depressed EV/EBITDA ratio is due to its reduced capitalization through the relentless stock price decline (down 40% in the last month) that was driven by the weak guidance, and oil tanking. But, I think more by the general End Of The World conditions in the industry, than anything else. I think it is over done and if FRAC were to just draw even with the cohort in terms of EV/EBITDA, a 25-30% gain from current levels might be realized, as conditions improve in Q-1.

Shares closed that day at $6.50, but investors hoped that the man who turned around Sybase would lead to great things for BlackBerry. More than five years later, another post-earnings crash in the stock has put the name effectively lower since Chen took over, as investors wonder if this name has any hope left. As US markets fell on Monday, BlackBerry shares dropped as low as $6.57, less than a dime from that November 2013 close before finishing the trading shortened day at $6.77. However, if one takes into account inflation since that date, investors have effectively lost money, especially since BlackBerry doesn't pay a dividend. You can't blame the market over the long term since the Technology Select Sector SPDR ETF (XLK) is up 86.5% since John Chen was named interim CEO. BlackBerry has underperformed in a major way. Last week, BlackBerry reported fiscal Q3 results, which as usual, showed beats on both the top and bottom lines. Of course, it often helps that management usually talks down the future a bit, leading to analysts cutting estimates between reports. Since the September report, the average revenue estimate for Q3 dropped by $10 million, which was about two-thirds the size of the beat. There also was a one-time IP deal done during the quarter as mentioned on the conference call that helped that segment's revenue to beat. On the segment front, BTS, which houses Radar and QNX, showed nice growth of more than 23% to $53 million. That growth rate may come down a little in the next couple of quarters as we work off higher base numbers from prior year periods. IP and Licensing showed a 36% jump, thanks to more consistent revenues generated along with that one-time deal. Enterprise software and services declined by 1% as the company still faces headwinds from an accounting change. Overall software/services growth was 14%, while hardware revenues were nil and service access fees dipped to $9 million.\\n When looking at the overall financials, gross margins ticked down about 150 basis points sequentially. That's a little surprising given the step up in revenues of $14 million, given margins are supposed to rise on higher revenue amounts. The good news is that operating expenses were trimmed a little, reducing the operating loss (after excluding debt adjustment) to $11 million. Some free cash flow was generated, mostly thanks to taking down working capital items like receivables. The company maintained its primary guidance for growth of its software/services segment and total billings, but it seems analysts wanted a little more. Also, the Street may be thinking some IP revenue was pulled forward. The average Street revenue estimates for Q4 is down by $4 million since last week's report, continuing the trend we've seen after many of the company's reports. We should see forward estimates rise a bit in the coming months once the Cylance deal is completed. Investors are still wondering how much Cylance will contribute on the revenue/earnings front, as those details won't come until the deal is finalized or perhaps the March earnings report. BlackBerry shares have now lost more than 53% since their 52-week high. Overall market weakness certainly has not helped, but investors have turned a bit sour since the Cylance deal was announced, given it will take up most of the company's net cash position. This quarter also showed a similar trend of shares popping right after earnings, only to lose those gains and more in the coming days and weeks. If management truly believes in the future, it should really consider a stock buyback now to offset the potential dilution from the convertible bonds, saving hundreds of millions in the process. After hitting a high of $147.55 in 2008, BlackBerry shares fell to just $5.75 in 2013. On Monday, shares closed just a dollar above that 15-year low. While US markets are dropping, investors haven't been impressed by the Cylance deal or the latest earnings report. The company made good progress on the software/services front but that just doesn't seem to matter at the moment. All of the gains that were made under John Chen's leadership have been wiped out, and institutions have been selling considerably over the past year and a half. A buyback would certainly be nice currently, but I don't think we will see one right now. Maybe sentiment will change after the Cylance deal brings in some much-needed revenue growth.\\n Author's additional disclosure: Investors are always reminded that before making any investment, you should do your own proper due diligence on any name directly or indirectly mentioned in this article.

The company which designs, develops, and markets analog, mixed-signal, digital signal processing, and embedded and standalone integrated circuits has had a down year so far, declining nearly -30% YTD. Tech in general has had a rough last few months with an economic slowdown projected for 2019. Despite the sector\\'s struggles Marvell could have a very nice year thanks to diversification and gross margin expansion. With gaming on the rise Marvell\\'s hard disk drive (HDD) and ethernet technology should in turn flourish (Figure 1). With the growth of 4K a higher level of bandwidth is required to maintain a high level of video quality and MRVL offers the products that allow this to happen. With leading products in automotive, consumer, carrier, industrial, enterprise, and cloud devices Marvell offers one of the most diverse investments in tech in 2019 and a potential for nice returns in both short-term and long-term investments. \\n\\n (Figure 1) Marvell Offers Some Of The Fastest Ethernet Transceivers In The Market Found In Home, Work, And Gaming Technology Many technology companies specialize in one or two premier products which leads to dramatic cyclical swings. Marvell has begun to expand to multiple industries allowing for more secular growth in their future. While companies like Micron (MU) and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) fall into cyclical downturns, Marvell has the potential to stay strong and stand out in the semiconductor sector. Gaming, cloud software, and storage account for a large portion of MRVL\\'s current profits with big name customers ranging from Apple (AAPL) to Western Digital (WDC). This could change as the company has added multiple new sources of potential income in innovative industries.\\n Marvell\\'s products will help to lead the charge towards a 5G infrastructure as well. As this transition over from primarily 4G LTE to 5G integration begins to work its way into carriers such as AT&T (T) and Verizon (VZ) more and more MRVL will continue to profit (Figure 2). The company has done a fantastic job of remaining a part of all of the latest innovations to come along. As 5G continues to get mentioned more and more in the news this could be very profitable for MRVL within 1-2 years. \\n\\n (Figure 2) Marvell Continues To Capitalize On Innovative Ideas From 4K TV To 5G Bandwidth Another innovative solution that could bring big gains in the more distant future for MRVL is their entry into the autonomous automobile industry. Their wireless ethernet technology will be vital to safety and functionality of autonomous cars. This is one of the longer term products being developed by Marvell that will not have a huge impact on the price of the stock now, but will in the more distant future. With Tesla (TSLA), Google (GOOGL), Uber, and more working towards autonomous driving vehicles this could be very profitable in the next 5-10 years. Other shorter term products Marvell has going for them include innovative chips for printers, ThunderX cloud processors, Fibre Channel storage, and much more. Marvell was recently named the \"2018 Most Respected Public Semiconductor Company\" by the global semiconductor alliance, for companies with $1 billion to $5 billion in annual sales. With a P/E of around 53x Marvell is expected to grow rapidly in the upcoming years. Merging with Cavium (NASDAQ:CAVM) has opened up new potential for MRVL as well. Marvell may be one of the best options in the tech sector to add to your portfolio this new year.\\n Valuation Following The Cavium Deal Marvell is a high-growth company trading at a low-growth price. They currently have one of the lowest EV/EBITDA ratios (on a trailing basis) among their peers trading around 23.9x as opposed to other growth semiconductors such as Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) 51x, or Nvidia (NVDA), 25x. MRVL recently purchased Cavium for approximately $6 billion this past summer adding to their growth potential. The deal will allow for greater revenue diversification and raise them to a larger scale to compete with industry giants such as Intel (INTC) and Broadcom (Figure 3). The company has had nice results since the addition of Cavium to their portfolio (increasing Q3 revenue by over 38%) and this will be a key factor to growth going forward for Marvell. \\n\\n (Figure 3) Cavium Deal Expands Marvell\\'s Diversification To A New Level That Will Allow Them To Compete With Some Of The Largest Names In The Industry Marvell is projected to increase revenue by nearly 20% next year, breaking $3.6 billion. EPS is expected to rise as well as the company continues to post consistent numbers here beating analysts\\' expectations almost every quarter since 2014. Much of the company\\'s EPS gains in the most recent quarter can be credited to the $1 billion share repurchase added in October. Moves like these show that management is actively working to reward investors and grow not only the company, but the stock itself also. Along with these consistent earnings and revenue beats the company has integrated a nearly 1.7% dividend yield in as well. Marvell has maintained their premium price target range throughout the last few months for the most part even though semiconductor stocks have had a brutal end to the year (Figure 4). From Citigroup (C) to JPMorgan (JPM), big name analysts like Marvell Technologies reiteratting price targets on average around 23.83, an approximately 60% upside.\\n \\n\\n (Figure 4) Wall Street Analysts Agree Marvell Technologies Has Potential For Big Gains In 2019 Based off of an up to 50% undervaluation to peers such as AMD when looking at EV/EBITDA ratios and the addition of Cavium to their portfolio being largely overlooked, and estimates of 20% growth seeming conservative, I believe this stock has anywhere between a 50% to 70% upside in 2019 if the overall markets can work themselves out of the funk they have been in since October. Although riskier than most tech investments such as Broadcom, MRVL offers potential for incredible gains through a company that is just beginning to really take off and make the transition to a larger scale. A price target within the discussed range of $22 which is just above 50% returns within the next year or so seems very realistic to me. Risks One noticeable negative when looking at Marvell is the company’s debt. MRVL has around $1.86 billion in total debt going forward. This is a fairly large amount for a mid-cap sized company, but should not be a substantial issue going forward as long as revenue continues to grow and meet/exceed expectations, bringing in positive cash flow into the future that will allow the company to remain financially stable long-term. MRVL has done a nice job avoiding cyclical downturns compared to companies such as Advanced Micro Devices and Micron (MU), so although debt is not a good sign it is not as critical to MRVL as it is for other mid-cap semi stocks. The company currently has around $537 million in free cash flow so this debt does not look like it will negatively impact the company too much. Especially if you look at the company\\'s debt/EBITDA ratio which is a rather small 3.1x.\\n It has been obvious semiconductor stocks have been one of the hardest hit sectors in recent months as the NASDAQ declines day after day. Much of this decline is due to supply and demand. Many chips have reached their peak sales and it looks like it could be all downhill from here for sometime. Because of this Marvell has really hurt. This stock looks to be greatly oversold in this period as MRVL offers a diverse portfolio of products that should be able to protect them from really bad losses in cyclical downturns. The company still has a long way to go, but with additions like Cavium they are making steps toward being as protected as you can in tech for downturns. The company has seen declines to around $8 a share in both 2012 and 2015 so there is still substantial room for downside when investing in Marvell Tech. Finding a bottom will be key to making money off of MRVL. It is not as much if this stock will take off, but when. Investor\\'s Takeaway With much of tech in correction to bear market territory investors are looking for new buying opportunities for 2019 that allow for better protection in cyclical downturn. Although Marvell still has rather high risk it also brings about potential for 50 plus percent gains over the next year as they diversify and grow. Following the Cavium deal, Marvell offers an attractive valuation when looking at EV/EBITDA (Figure 5). The company is a part of all the latest innovations from 4K TV and gaming to autonomous driving and even 5G bandwidth. MRVL looks to be one of the most attractive plays in tech in 2019 earning 15 back to back buy ratings. With my price target of around $22 if the market does not fall into severe bear territory, Marvell may be a smart addition to your portfolio. \\n\\nMRVL EV to EBITDA (Forward) data by YCharts\\n (Figure 5) MRVL Has An Attractive Valuation When Looking At Forward EV/EBITDA \\nDisclosure: I/we have no positions in any stocks mentioned, but may initiate a long position in MRVL over the next 72 hours.

When reality sets in, the share price will inevitably deflate.'], 'article': [\"Tesla (TSLA) has been talking up its China plans for quite a while. The electric vehicle maker has leased a plot of land in Shanghai, which is intended to develop into a facility for producing both cars and batteries. While Tesla has repeatedly stated it is accelerating its development process, little progress has materialized on the ground. China remains little more than a narrative, with the proposed factory site still just a wet field. While still Tesla claims it will be able to begin production in China in the second half of 2019, that prospect (always dubious) now looks next to impossible. That's a big problem for a company facing increasing domestic competition, a troubled global economy, and the vicissitudes of an ongoing trade conflict between the United States and China. Tesla is propping up China as part of a grand growth narrative. When the more mundane reality sets in, Tesla’s rarefied stock price is bound to suffer. Let’s discuss. A Place Called Shanghai Tesla has offered a succession of conflicting stories when it comes to its proposed Shanghai plant. On Oct. 17, it was revealed that the company had acquired a plot of land for the purpose of building a new Gigafactory. Initial reporting on the land acquisition implied that Tesla had purchased the land in Shanghai for $140 million. In actuality, it signed a 50-year lease, with payments set to commence in March 2019.\\n There also are disputes about cost. In August, Tesla claimed it would cost only $2 billion. That number has raised eyebrows within the investment community. Goldman Sachs, for example, has modeled the likely cost of a factory of the size proposed to be closer to $4 to $5 billion. Goldman’s prediction holds water given comparable projects carried out by other automakers in China. General Motors (GM), for example, has seen an average construction cost of $5.6 billion per factory. Yet, there are still no reports of where the money for the China factory will be coming from. And the plot of land remains little more than a patch of mud. Tesla claims it will come from local sources, but that remains to be seen. Contradictory Timetable CEO Elon Musk has offered a raft of contradictions when it comes to Tesla’s China strategy. On the August earnings call, he stated that the Shanghai factory would play a major part in Tesla’s stated aim of achieving annual production of 1 million vehicles in 2020. Yet that stands in direct opposition to a prior statement from November 2017, when he admitted that it would take at least three years for Tesla to get a factory up and running in China. Tesla kicked things into even higher gear in October when it announced it would be “accelerating” the China Gigafactory in response to tariffs levied as a result of the intensifying trade conflict between the United States and China. Tesla now claims it plans to have the factory up and running in 2019, with vehicle production to begin in the second half of the year. A production start in 2020 was already ambitious. To push for 2019 defies reason. But Tesla has managed to garner a host of uncritical media coverage on this new, intensely aggressive timetable. Reports from the Frontline While the Western media was happy to report on Tesla’s breakneck progress in China, voices in the Chinese government have sounded a note of skepticism. Indeed, a report in the Global Times, an organ of the Chinese Communist Party, has sounded some interesting alarms. Reporters from the publication visited Tesla’s Shanghai site to check up on the “accelerating” construction. Instead of frenetic activity, they witnessed a ghost town:\\n    Dormant activity at the site of the Tesla Gigafactory outside of Shanghai is fueling speculation that the company may not be able to deliver units as scheduled amid strong competition in China. When the Global Times visited the site on Wednesday, there were no cranes at work or logistics vehicles entering or leaving, making it look more wasteland than building site... the Global Times saw almost no signs of construction, such as heavy machinery at work. The land has been leveled, but there were almost no construction workers to be seen. A security guard, who said he had just recently started to work there, hadn't noticed much construction work during daylight hours. He also said he did not know what project he was guarding when asked by the Global Times.  This matters for two reasons. First, it indicates a firsthand account of the situation on the ground. Specifically, Tesla has not actually accelerated construction. Indeed, it seems as if little construction is happening at all. The second reason this matters is that it's a state media organ reporting the story. Tesla is counting on bringing in billions of dollars from local investors to fund construction. A negative word from the government could prove to have a profound chilling effect on any such investment. Darkening Outlook This latest drama only adds to Tesla’s increasing China agonies. Tariffs have forced the company to swallow numerous price cuts in recent months. Even with this month’s rollback of punitive tariffs on American auto imports, Tesla felt compelled to cut its prices for the third time this quarter. Tesla’s Chinese operations do not look great by any measure. According to a report from one domestic industry body, Tesla sales fell a staggering 70% in October. While Tesla called this report “wildly inaccurate,” it has offered no data to support its refutation. And things may only get worse. On Dec. 26, the Chinese government announced it would be slashing subsidies for electric vehicles by 30% in 2019, and that they would be phased out entirely in 2020. This will likely put even harsher pressure on Tesla’s margins, even as a host of new electric vehicle makers make gains in China.\\n Investor’s Eye View Tesla’s foray into China is fascinating. It juxtaposes a narrative of accelerating development with a much less exciting reality. Facts do not, but narrative often mislead. In the case of Tesla in China, the promises and hype seem to be falling radically short of the reality on the ground. While Tesla is painting a rosy picture of vast growth in China, the reality has been far less pleasant. If anything, the American electric vehicle maker is losing ground in an increasingly competitive Chinese market. With construction apparently halted (if it ever really started) on the Shanghai Gigafactory, the prospect of it contributing at all to vehicle production in 2019 looks increasingly like a pipe dream. Tesla faces many challenges as it attempts to develop its first international factory. As hype gives way to the slow plodding progress of reality, Tesla’s share price should be knocked down more than a few pegs.\\nDisclosure: I am/we are short TSLA.

The company was aggressively repurchasing shares and the market didn't care. \\n\\nNVDA data by YCharts As the stock soared, the company quickly pulled back on capital returns. The net payout yield shrunk to a minimal 1% by 2017 due mostly to the small dividends. The key here is that the market got far ahead of realistic expectations. The management team told investors via reduced capital return plans that the stock above $100 wasn't attractive to them. The important part of this thesis is that while investors can keep riding an uptrend just because the signal flashes a value disconnect, investors don't have to dump the stock.\\n The nearly 60% hit in the stock again places Nvidia back into the interesting buy zone.

The company announced an intent to spend $3 billion on share repurchases in the next year is a big start from the muted $1.13 billion spent on capital returns year-to-date. The amount is a virtual blip from the nearly $80 billion market cap and a drop in the bucket from where the market valuation was up at $293.

The company will have somewhere from $3 billion to $4 billion in free cash flow to spend each year on capital returns plus a net cash balance of over $5 billion. How the company uses these cash flows will provide a key signal on the stock. \\n\\nNVDA EPS Estimates for Current Fiscal Year data by YCharts\\n End Of Crypto Weakness For Nvidia to reach a bottom, a lot of the cryptocurrency inventory headwinds need a resolution. The company has a strong future in datacenter and automotive markets growth, but the gaming market still accounts for the vast majority of revenues. A lot of questions still exist with the gaming sector due to gaming cards being used by crypto miners causing an inventory flood as the crypto market has gone bust. CFO Corlette Kress had the following to say on the FQ3'19 earnings call:    However, gaming was short of expectations as post crypto channel inventory took longer than expected to sell through. Gaming card prices, which were elevated following the sharp crypto falloff, took longer than expected to normalize. Our Q4 outlook for gaming reflects very little shipment in the midrange Pascal [segment] [ph] to allow channel inventory to normalize.  Fellow contributor Mark Hibben makes a strong case for the crypto mining impact on Nvidia being a minimal part of the surging demand for gaming GPU revenues over the last couple of years. The headwind of these inventories being dumped on the market combined with those lost revenues stunts growth in the short term. \\n\\nNvidia isn't seeing any demand issues with their new Turning RX family. The ray-tracing technology is in high demand from gaming enthusiasts again reinforcing that the crypto mining induced issue is related solely to midrange Pascal GPUs that account for roughly a third of gaming revenues. A clear signal that a turnaround has started will be the bottom in gaming revenues. Quarterly gaming revenues have held flat in the $1.7 billion this year even as the crypto market has seen revenues plunge. The market will look closely at FQ1'20 guidance and where the inventory correction lies when the company reports earnings for FQ4.\\n \\n\\nSource: Nvidia quarterly revenue trends  Takeaway The key investor takeaway is that the correction in Nvidia is about over, if the company follows through on stock buybacks. The inventory correction in the gaming GPU segment should've reached a low point here and the BOD agreeing to repurchase shares would be a strong confirmation. The signal is likely to only flash a tepid bullish sign due to $3 billion only amounting to ~4% of the outstanding shares. The stock is still a risky momentum play betting on growth in AI and machine learning. Nvidia would need to dip below $100 before the share buybacks would reach high enough levels to reduce the risk of owning the stock as the company would start reducing the share float at an aggressive pace. The most crucial data point for the FQ4 earnings report will be the share repurchases. The company needs to aggressively spend more than $1 billion on share buybacks for confirmation that the recently sell off was overdone.

However, I have not purchased shares of Monroe Capital (MRCC) since 2016 for the reasons discussed in this article. High-yield investments, including BDCs, have been declining since early September potentially for a few reasons, including investors expecting higher yields and fear of an economic slowdown and/or higher interest rates. However, MRCC has declined more than the others and is now below its January/February 2016 lows (discussed next): \\n\\n Source: Yahoo Finance Quick BDC Market Update The general markets have been declining for various reasons, some of which are related to BDCs (including a potential economic slowdown), but the underlying fundamentals of the U.S. economy and BDCs remain strong. In January/February 2016, the markets experienced similar concerns, including slowing Chinese growth and increased energy sector defaults driving higher yield expectations, especially for non-investment grade debt, as shown in the chart below. Please see “Junk bonds suffer a rare negative return in January”. This also resulted in wider interest rate spreads and favorable lending conditions. Higher-quality BDCs typically have much higher portfolio growth during these periods, as they take advantage of higher market yields.\\n \\n\\n Source: FRED However, this drives counter-intuitive pricing and is usually the time when investors are discounting pricing for BDC stocks (including MRCC), expecting higher yields due to “a flight to safety mode”. The average BDC yield is almost 12.2%, which is much higher-than-average over the last seven years: \\n\\n \\n\\n Source: SEC Filings and BDC Buzz MRCC Risk Profile Update and Changes to NAV Per Share As predicted in the previous articles, MRCC continues to have issues with its investment in Rockdale Blackhawk, LLC (“Rockdale”) that previously filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy as part of a restructuring process. However, the company is now refusing to make additional investments in Rockdale due to “not sticking to agreed-upon budgets”, and is in the process of converting from a Chapter 11 bankruptcy to Chapter 7, under which a trustee would be appointed to liquidate its assets and shut down facilities. That hasn\\'t happened yet, but court records show that Little River Healthcare was already unable to pay its employees for the week ended November 30, 2018. This was also reported on local news but has not been disclosed by MRCC as of the writing of this article:\\n Little River Healthcare facilities unexpectedly closes its doors \\n\\n Please see \\'Quality of Management\\' section below for related discussions. During Q2 2018, MRCC completely marked down its equity portion of Rockdale that was offset by markups in the debt portion. However, during Q3 2018, the company relinquished its equity stake and made a small additional investment under the debtor in possession (“DIP”) financing facility “established in conjunction with the bankruptcy” and received repayments on a portion of its pre-petition debt. \\n\\n Source: SEC Filings and BDC Buzz MRCC’s investment in Rockdale still accounts for almost $18 million, or around 3.7% of the portfolio. The worst-case scenario would likely be a complete write-down of its investment, which would reduce NAV by around $0.87 per share (or 6.7%) to $12.08 per share and I have taken this into account with the worst-case projections. Management mentioned that its Rockdale investment was valued appropriately but that “there is a range of outcome[s], some of which are considerably higher and some of which are lower”: We are required to mark every assets to what we believe is a fair market value in every quarter, based on the available information. And we use independent third-parties to assist us in that and we have done nothing different this period than any other period and nothing different with this investment than other investments. And I will just say probably there is a range of outcome[s], some of which are considerably higher and some of which are lower. So, this is the best expectation of what we think the fair value of the loan is today based on the view of the independent third-party and all the contingencies.Source: Monroe Capital Corporation CEO Theodore Koenig on Q3 2018 Results - Earnings Call Transcript \\n Management still believes that its investments in Rockdale are supported by assets for a “potential recovery at our debt over our debt and above our debt”: We have got a variety of assets here at Rockdale to collect against. There are facilities and there is some very large accounts receivable. There is a plan in place currently a legal proceeding to collect those accounts receivable. Assuming that we collect the accounts receivable, we are going to be covered under our loan with plenty of headroom there. Obviously litigation is always a - there is some I\\'m sure, and some doubt, so we have taken what we thought was a reasonable mark on that this quarter. We feel that based upon the information we have available to us today and the legal advice that we are getting and the opinions we received we think we have a pretty good mark and hopefully we will have some upside there. But like everything else, we are trying and do this in a conservative fashion and we thought it was appropriate to take the mark this time. We have been advised by several law firms that we have got very solid recovery prospects here and we are going to pursue every potential recovery at our debt over our debt and above our debt.Source: Monroe Capital Corporation CEO Theodore Koenig on Q3 2018 Results - Earnings Call Transcript  During Q3 2018, NAV declined by $0.40 per share, or 3.0%, largely due to Rockdale, and there were realized losses of $5.6 million, including the sale of its debt investments in Millennial Brands LLC (previously Rocket Dog Brands LLC), which was one of its smaller investments previously marked down. Thanks to the shareholder-friendly fee agreement, management was not paid incentive fees for Q3 2018 due to unrealized losses, including the other meaningful markdown in American Community Homes (“ACH”), resulting in unrealized losses of around $1.7 million, or $0.08 per share. The fair value of MRCC’s investment in ACH is still around $13.3 million and needs to be watched. Management expects “that the company can be improved and that we will enjoy a full recovery” as discussed on the recent call:\\n long-term, we expect the recovery here, sponsor here has made significant changes to management and as advisors in who have made fairly large cost cuts to the business, which we don’t think will impact the business profitability going forward negatively, but only positively. And our expectation is that the company can be improved and that we will enjoy a full recovery. And we also have some equity in this business as well, which has some potential upside in the future as well, but for now this is the fair market value on the loans. There were some additional funding I mentioned on the term loan during the period, which is what you are seeing with regards to the increase in funding.Source: Monroe Capital Corporation CEO Theodore Koenig on Q3 2018 Results - Earnings Call Transcript The total fair value of investments on non-accrual status increased to $13.4 million (2.8% of the portfolio FV) due to a portion of Rockdale Blackhawk, LLC (“Rockdale”) debt investments and Curion Holdings, LLC promissory notes added to non-accrual status during the quarter. Curion was discussed on the call and purchased at a discount with upside potential: We didn’t put all of Curion on non-accrual. What has happen is the company have a little bit of the liquidity softness, the private equity owners chose not to support the company with additional investments. And so we were in a position where we as part of our restructuring agreement with that sponsor took over effectively some promissory notes that we didn’t pay for, which has material, so we paid nominal amount but they have material upside, that is the note that we put on non-accrual, basically something that we were handed for free as part of restructuring, because the notes themselves the regular loans that we made originally are not markdown considerably. We think there is a really good long-term recovery for Curion, company is still current and paying interest on our notes - on our loans it’s just this one piece that we got as part of our restructuring that wasn’t prudent put on accrual. So although it’s possible we will get a significant recovery on that and eventually accrual investment income at this point it just didn’t seem prudent to approve that.Source: Monroe Capital Corporation CEO Theodore Koenig on Q3 2018 Results - Earnings Call Transcript\\n Other non-accruals include Incipio Technologies, Inc. (fair value of $1.4 million), TPP Operating, Inc. which was completely written off as discussed in previous reports and Millennial Brands LLC (previously Rocket Dog Brands LLC). \\n\\n Source: SEC Filings Grade 4: Includes an issuer performing materially below expectations and indicates that the issuer’s risk has increased materially since origination. In addition to the issuer being generally out of compliance with debt covenants, scheduled loan payments may be past due (but generally not more than six months past due). For grade 4 investments, we intend to increase monitoring of the issuer.Grade 5: Indicates that the issuer is performing substantially below expectations and the investment risk has substantially increased since origination. Most or all of the debt covenants are out of compliance or payments are substantially delinquent. Investments graded 5 are not anticipated to be repaid in full and we will reduce the fair market value of the loan to the amount we expect to recover. MRCC\\'s portfolio remains primarily of first lien loans, representing around 86% of the portfolio, and the company continues to grow its investment in the SLF (discussed next) that now accounts for over 5% of the portfolio: \\n\\n Source: SEC Filings MRCC Quality of Management and Fee Agreement BDCs with \"higher-quality\" management typically let investors know of material issues concerning portfolio investments, which MRCC management did not do on the earnings call in August 8, 2018. There is a good chance that part of the recent price decline is due to lack of shareholder trust, which is important and the reason why I include a “Quality of Management” section for each of the BDCs that I cover. On the recent call, management was asked why they did not let investors know about the Rockdale Blackhawk bankruptcy, and the answers did not impress me:\\n Q. And as of the last August earnings call, I mean that bankruptcy has already occurred. Was there reason was it still not public or why was it not flagged at the last earnings call?A. “The bankruptcy is kind of is not really the determining factor here of recovery. So, the issue and what has changed from last quarter this quarter is, at the time of the call last quarter, it was a view of the advisors that were supporting the management team and the company at Rockdale that it would be still in a position to generate significant EBITDA in terms of business around and there will be an ongoing entity, then the bankruptcy would effectively just be reorganization in order to get rid of some facilities potentially and look its unsecured claims all the normal bankruptcy related items. Since that time in this quarter, there has been a sort of change in reversal of the view point as to whether this company really has significant enterprise value or if it’s more of an asset value play. So, we have been consistent in saying that we felt that there was a significant asset value here, but what was reputed in last quarter mark and expectations when we held the call was that there might be still some significant enterprise value here, which was way into the fair market value where as now this thing guide more on an assets value basis.”The bankruptcy is not - as lot of people don’t know the credit part of it - see the bankruptcy is somehow a meaningful element in the recovery of the company in terms of its negative. Bankruptcy is often very positive as it deals with unsecured creditors through the court system. So the bankruptcy isn\\'t terribly relevant in terms of recovery and mark on this company. it\\'s really a strategy change and obviously we didn’t sell any equity assets at Rockdale Bank. But it\\'s not a it\\'s not something that is particularly meaningful with regards to the recovery plan. It\\'s just a way to get out of our recovery, it didn’t change much of the situation with how we view that.Source: Monroe Capital Corporation CEO Theodore Koenig on Q3 2018 Results - Earnings Call Transcript\\n Management will likely waive upcoming incentive fees as it works through Rockdale, which is upside potential for my base-case projections, which are typically conservative. The company has been responsive to requests for information and has a best-of-breed fee structure that takes into account capital losses when calculating income incentive fees to management, also known as using a “high water mark” or “total return hurdle”. The base management fee is 1.75% of assets excluding cash. Management has been waiving incentive fees to protect the dividend coverage each quarter, but this was not needed for the recent quarters due to the previously discussed unrealized losses. The company currently does not have a share repurchase plan in place, but given the recent trading history below NAV, there is a good chance one will be adopted and was discussed previously. Similar to other externally managed BDCs, MRCC benefits from having access to a broader credit platform, managed by an affiliate of Monroe Capital Management Advisors, with approximately $5.6 billion of assets under management, giving the company access to scale, relationships, and expertise. MRCC\\'s Reduced Asset Coverage Ratio On June 20, 2018, MRCC held its 2018 annual meeting and shareholders approved the company becoming subject to a minimum asset coverage ratio of 150%, permitting it to double its leverage based on the following votes: \\n\\n Source: SEC Filing As a result, and subject to satisfying certain ongoing disclosure requirements, effective June 21, 2018, the asset coverage ratio test applicable to the company has been decreased from 200% to 150%, permitting MRCC to double the amount of leverage. On the November 2018 earnings call, management mentioned that they are currently working with existing lenders to allow implement a 150% asset coverage ratio “so that we may fully take advantage of the regulatory relief from the small business credit availability act, which we have already received shareholder approval to implement”.\\n MRCC Dividend Coverage Update For the quarter ended September 30, 2018, MRCC reported between my base- and best-case projections, mostly due to the \"total return requirement\" driving no incentives fees paid and covering its dividend for the 18th straight quarter. There was another decline in its portfolio yield from 10.0% to 9.7% and a decline in portfolio investments due to “significant prepayment activity” driving lower interest income. There was no prepayment-related income (due to older loans repaying), and the Rockdale non-accrual also impacted income during the quarter: The decrease in total investment income for the quarter was primarily as a result of reduction in interest income principally due to additional non-accruals and a reduction in fee income associated with the prepayments partially offset by an increase in dividend income from the SLF. While we experienced prepayment activity in the quarter, due to the vintage of many of these loans there was no appreciable amount of prepayment penalty due.Source: Monroe Capital Corporation CEO Theodore Koenig on Q3 2018 Results - Earnings Call Transcript \\n\\n Source: SEC Filings and BDC Buzz MRCC has around $0.46 per share of undistributed net investment income for coverage shortfalls. “We continue to maintain approximately $0.46 per share of un-distributed net investment income, which in our view provides a significant cushion to our ability to maintain a consistent quarterly dividend payment to our shareholders without returning capital.”Source: Monroe Capital Corporation CEO Theodore Koenig on Q3 2018 Results - Earnings Call Transcript Management was asked about the stability of the dividend given the recent increase in credit issues and mentioned continued growth of the portfolio, use of leverage, and “the dividend is very, very secure and as you know I\\'m a big owner of the stock and where it is right now”.\\n Its new joint venture with NLV Financial Corporation, the MRCC Senior Loan Fund (“SLF”), previously obtained third-party financing that is expected to allow the joint venture to access market levels of leverage and \"positively contribute to our earnings in future quarters\". On October 31, 2018, SLF closed an amendment to the SLF Credit Facility, increasing the commitments under the facility to $150.0 million. During the quarter ended September 30, 2018, the company received an income distribution from SLF of $0.6 million, compared to the $0.3 million received during the quarter ended June 30, 2018. I am expecting continued growth of its SLF over the coming quarters as guided by management on the recent call: “We expect the SLF to continue to grow over the next few quarters. To assist with this growth, we recently amended the SLF’s credit facility to increase capacity to $150 million an increase from the capacity outstanding at quarter-end of $100 million. It’s a significant earnings contributor, it’s growing at a pretty good cliff over the last two quarters. And we have just increased our senior credit facility for the JV by about a third. We have grown I think about 40% quarter-over-quarter and that is a good contributing asset and I imagine that will continue to grow over the next several quarters.”Source: Monroe Capital Corporation CEO Theodore Koenig on Q3 2018 Results - Earnings Call Transcript \\n\\n The company has a regulatory debt-to-equity ratio of 0.46 (excluding SBA debentures), giving it borrowing capacity due to slower-than-expected portfolio growth. However, management has guided for higher use of leverage through the end of the year, and since the end of the quarter, has added $30 million of investments, net of prepayments.\\n As a company, I believe we\\'re under leveraged. We\\'ve been operating our business conservatively, and we are underleveraged. I think our regulatory leverage today is about 0.5:1. As you know, the omnibus bill that was passed, allows us to go to 2:1. 2:1 is a long, long cry from 0.5:1. I\\'m hopeful that we can manage our business effectively to get to 1:1 leverage here by the end of the year. I don\\'t think we\\'ll get there. I think that we\\'ll probably end up somewhere closer to 0.7:1 or 0.75:1 in that range. But my goal was going to try and get us to 1:1 here on leverage because I think that\\'s probably the right place for us to be in the near term.Source: Monroe Capital Corporation CEO Theodore Koenig on Q3 2018 Results - Earnings Call Transcript On September 12, 2018, the MRCC closed a public offering of $69 million of 5.75% senior unsecured notes that will mature on October 31, 2023. As of September 30, 2018, the company had $148.5 million available for additional borrowings on its revolving credit facility (due to repayment from proceeds from the unsecured notes) and has fully drawn all available debentures at its SBIC. MRCC Interest Rate Sensitivity Analysis Interest rate sensitivity refers to the change in earnings that may result from changes in interest rates. Most BDCs continue to experience higher portfolio yields mostly due to the rising LIBOR that should improve (or at least maintain) net interest margins and dividend coverage for the sector in the coming quarters. There is a good chance that the company will be able to maintain or improve its portfolio yield in the coming quarters due to continued rise in LIBOR as well as new investments at higher yields. \\n\\n Source: FRED\\n As of September 30, 2018, a majority of the loans in MRCC\\'s portfolio have floating interest rates, and only 22% of borrowings are at variable rates due to the recently issued 2023 notes. MRCC is well positioned for future interest rate increases. With all of our portfolio is invested in floating rate debt with rates floors. Given the current LIBOR level, we have surpassed the level of the LIBOR floors and all our loans and therefore MRCC is situated to meaningfully benefit from any increase in short-term interest rates going forward. In addition, we have $150 million outstanding in fixed rate debt from SBA debentures and $69 million outstanding in fixed rate debt from the recent issued 2023 notes, which will allow us significant interest rate arbitrage and any increase in LIBOR in the future.Source: Monroe Capital Corporation CEO Theodore Koenig on Q3 2018 Results - Earnings Call Transcript \\n\\n Source: SEC Filings and BDC Buzz Summary and Recommendations MRCC is currently for \"higher yield investors\" due to continued credit issues and management that needs to reassure investors regarding their underwriting process and, more importantly, the reasons for not disclosing material credit issues in the portfolio, especially given that this information is publicly available. The additional credit issues discussed in this article, including the recent Rockdale events, are likely already priced into the stock, which is on sale along with entire sector due to investors expecting higher yields and fears of an economic slowdown and/or higher interest rates. As shown in the chart below, the UBS ETRACS Wells Fargo Business Development Company ETN (BDCS) is now near its previous lows from January/February 2016. The following are three mostly likely general market scenarios and what I will be doing in each case:\\n  \"Dead cat bounce\", where stock prices start to rebound but then continue down. In this scenario, I will continue to make select purchases and then wait to make meaningful purchases of many BDCs, likely in January/February 2019. Continued market declines through January/February 2019, where I will be waiting for the selling pressures to abate before making multiple purchases. A solid round of good news regarding interest rate policy and the economy driving a full rebound back to previous levels, where I will be making meaningful purchases on the way back up.  \\n\\n \\n\\n Source: Investing.com and BDC Buzz To be a successful BDC investor:  Establish appropriate price targets based on relative risk and returns (mostly from regular and potential special dividends).

Like many of the previous bears, it\\'s been an elevator down, with a 20% decline in just 3 months. \\n\\n The question many are asking: Is this decline just a decline or is it signaling an oncoming recession? Looking back at history, the answer is far from clear. This is now the 21st bear market since 1929. Of the previous 20, only 11 were associated with a recession (55% of the time). \\n\\n The list of bears with no recession is probably longer than you would have guessed... \\n\\nWhat gives? Isn\\'t the stock market a \"leading indicator\" of the economy? Yes, it can be at times, but it\\'s far from a perfect one. Sometimes a bear is just a bear. Is this one of those times? We\\'ll only know in hindsight. Looking at the data, the U.S. economy does not yet appear to be in a recession, but that fact is hardly an all-clear. After the March 2000 stock market peak, a recession did not begin until a year later: March 2001. No one can say for sure that in September 2019 (a year from the September 2018 S&P 500 peak) there won\\'t be a recession. And so, we wait, evaluating the evidence as it develops. If a recession is coming, the odds favor a longer and deeper bear market (-42% over 17 months on average). But there\\'s much variation within those odds... In the 1990-91 recession, stocks declined only 20% over a 3-month period, and during the 1929-33 depression, stocks declined 86% during a 33-month period.\\n So while unlikely, a recession could be coming without any further stock market declines. It\\'s safe to say that most investors are probably not thinking about a repeat of the 1990 scenario. They are most likely assuming the 50%+ recessionary bear markets of 2000-02 and 2007-09 are the norm. While a repeat of these calamities is certainly possible, so is a much shallower bear market and recession, or no recession at all. In markets, every time is different. 2018 has proved this maxim once again.\\n']}\n",

Sell WGO.'], 'article': [' \\n\\n Winnebago CEO Mike Happe. Source: Des Moines Register Winnebago (WGO) reported strong results for the quarter ended Nov. 24, 2018. The company delivered revenue of $493.65 million and EPS of $0.07, beating on both revenue and earnings. I was actually shocked by how strong the results were. Through the first 10 months of the year RV shipments were down 1%. They also had fallen by double digits Y/Y in September and October. I naturally assumed Winnebago\\'s top line also would fall by double digits. Nothing could have been further from the case. The company grew revenue by 10% Y/Y and it did not have to sacrifice margins to do it. Gross margin ticked up by 40 basis points, which made the performance all the more impressive. Part of the top line growth was goosed by the acquisition of Chris-Craft, a recreational boat builder, over the summer. However, they were still impressive in light of the free fall in industry shipments. \\n\\nRevenue from reportable segments - Motor Homes and Towables - was up 6% Y/Y. Revenue from Motor Homes fell 4% on a 10% decline in deliveries and a 7% increase in average selling price (\"ASP\"). Management believes its wholesale sales pace exceeded that of the overall RV industry during the quarter - this implies the Motor Homes segment took market share away from competitors.\\n Towables revenue grew 13% as deliveries grew 8% and ASP grew 4%. Rising ASP in a declining sales environment was very positive. I assumed the company would have to offer discounts in order to move. The segment\\'s market share gains continued for the Grand Design and Winnebago branded RVs. Increased market share likely defined the company\\'s success in the quarter and could portend a zero sum game in the RV industry. Some investors saw Winnebago\\'s strong quarter as bullish for Thor (THO) and other RV manufacturers. Winnebago\\'s growth likely came out of someone else\\'s hide and the fall out may not fully materialize until the first quarter 2019. Market share increases could continue for the foreseeable future, but if industry RV shipments continue to fall it could weigh on Winnebago\\'s top line. The backlog fell 11% Y/Y in term of units. The dollar value of the backlog ($519 million) means the company likely has next quarter\\'s revenue already in its backlog. Its dealer inventory exceeded 21,000 units, up 30% Y/Y. It also was up about 8% sequentially. Winnebago likely wants to ensure its units are well positioned to be sold while industry RV shipments appear to have peaked. In my opinion, something has to give. Either declining sales, declining pricing power or declining margins could hit Winnebago, Thor or smaller competitors. Industry RV shipments for the month of November fell another 20% Y/Y, implying more pain ahead for the industry. Stable EBITDA Margins Winnebago was able to maintain its EBITDA margins during the quarter. There appear to be several hurdles for the company. Declining industry shipments mean the pie is shrinking for everybody. An industry participant may have to cut prices in order to move inventory off of dealer lots. Any hit to ASP could ripple throughout the industry. Tariffs have caused prices for steel and aluminum to ramp up. The inability to pass through cost increases to the end customer also could hurt margins. Nonetheless, Winnebago\\'s profit margin was 14.4%, up 40 basis points vs. the prior-year period. It enjoyed a favorable mix from growth in Towables and improved margins in Motor Homes. SG&A expense increased 21% Y/Y, which reflected investments in talent to build expertise in the company\\'s portfolio of outdoor lifestyle businesses. SG&A expense growth outstripped revenue growth, which caused EBITDA margins to remain flat at 8%.\\n Winnebago remains in growth mode, despite signs that discretionary spending may have ground to a halt and the U.S. economy may have peaked. Still, the company has levers to pull in terms of cost cutting if it wants to amplify EBITDA margins. The fact that Winnebago continues to spend in anticipation of top line growth sounds a bit optimistic. Cash flow from operations was $54 million, up $25 million vs. the year earlier period. Strong cash flow could be a competitive advantage as industry RV shipments continue to turn down. If pricing power erodes then Winnebago could be well positioned to weather the storm vis-a-vis smaller competitors. Conclusion WGO reported solid financial results. However, I do not envision how a continued free fall in RV shipments could be positive. WGO is off over 55% Y/Y and will likely fall further. Sell WGO. Disclosure: I am/we are short WGO, THO.

Introduction Statistics Canada started including cannabis in their monthly retail trade figures release starting in October. Since Canada legalized recreational cannabis on October 17, the October retail trade figures included the first two weeks of legalization sales, which totaled $43 million. The data has profound implications for the industry's largest producers such as Canopy Growth Corp. (CGC), Aurora Cannabis (ACB), Aphria (APHA), HEXO Corp. (OTCPK:HYYDF) and CannTrust Holdings (OTC:CNTTF). These stocks need strong sales in early 2019 in order to sustain their valuation. Investors have not had the opportunity to assess market size and profitability potential for Canadian pot stocks. The early readings sent mixed signals to the market as severe supply shortages hampered early sales. (All amounts in C$ unless otherwise noted.) $43 Million Sold in October Since Canada officially legalized cannabis on October 17, 2018, the country has generated $43 million in sales during the two weeks. The data came from Statistics Canada as part of their monthly retail trade data release for the month of October. The fact that cannabis is being included in the monthly trade data along with traditional sectors such as automobile, clothing, food, electronics etc., suggested the importance of this industry to the country's economy. It is safe to say cannabis will become an indispensable part of the Canadian economy.\\n \\n\\n (Source: Statistics Canada) Based on the data from Statistics Canada, below is the breakdown of the $43 million by province. Ontario and Quebec accounted for half of the total sales, followed by Alberta, Nova Scotia, and British Columbia. The breakdown is not surprising, as Ontario and Quebec are two of the largest provinces. However, British Columbia definitely disappointed with only $2.3 million in sales while having Canada's third-largest population. The poor performance could be due to a vibrant and longstanding illegal market in B.C. and the fact that it had only one store open on day 1 of legalization.  Ontario: $11.7 million Quebec: $10.8 million Alberta: $5.6 million Nova Scotia: $4.5 million British Columbia: $2.3 million New Brunswick: $2.1 million Newfoundland: $1.7 million Prince Edward Island: $1.4 million Saskatchewan: $0.3 million  Another interesting data point to look at is the sales per capita among the top provincial markets in Canada. It is very telling and interesting to see that the top four provinces with the biggest sales per capita are the four smallest provinces by population. Meanwhile, the largest provinces (Ontario, B.C., Alberta, Quebec) posted much lower sales per person, likely due to severe product shortages and inability to open enough brick-and-mortar stores on day 1. PEI has the highest spend per person despite having the smallest population among the provinces. \\n\\n\\n (Source: CBC News and Statistics Canada) Case Study: Massachusetts We thought it would be interesting to compare Canada's performance with that of another state that recently started legal recreational sales. Massachusetts legalized recreational pot in 2016 and opened its first two retail stores in November 2018. The two cannabis dispensaries generated total sales of US$7 million between November 20 and December 9, a period of 3 weeks. Sales have slowed down during the fourth week, and total cumulative sales stood at US$9.3 million as of December 16, 2018. \\n\\n (Source: MA Government) To put this into perspective, Massachusetts has a population of 7 million, compared to 37 million in Canada. The closest Canadian province in terms of its population would be Quebec with 8.4 million residents. With only two retail dispensaries and no online shopping, the U.S. state generated US$7 million in sales during the first three weeks, which implies US$4.7 million sales during the first two weeks using straight-line extrapolation. For comparison purposes, adjusting for the difference in population, Massachusetts would have generated US$25 million in sales, compared to the $43 million in Canada. Note that we have ignored the foreign exchange rate and the fact that Massachusetts had only two stores open and did not have online sales, which was a critical component of Canada's legal pot sales after accounting for 100% of Ontario and a majority of other provinces' sales during October. While the numbers look better for Canada, one should expect the country as a whole to perform much better and avoid the operational challenges that have plagued the licensed producers and governments alike. Conclusion\\n Canadians spent $43 million on buying legal cannabis during the first two weeks of legalization in October. The smaller provinces in the country reported the highest sales per capita due to better preparation, while the largest provinces struggled to put their act together. The chaotic scene in Canada resulted in a big disappointment for pot investors, which is reflected in the share price of Canadian cannabis stocks. On the other hand, the two stores in Massachusetts generated over US$7 million in sales from legal pot during the first three weeks since opening in November this year, indicating massive consumer demand and the potential for the U.S. market.\\nDisclosure: I/we have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

Today’s call is being recorded. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. There will be an opportunity for questions at the end of the call. [Operator Instructions]\\nI would now like to turn the call over to Patty Kehe of Dynasil. Ms. Kehe, please go ahead.\\nPatricia Kehe\\nThank you, Mark, and good afternoon, everyone. With me today are Peter Sulick, Dynasil’s Chairman, CEO, and President; and Rob Bowdring, Dynasil’s Chief Financial Officer.\\nBefore we begin, please note that various remarks management makes on today’s conference call that are not historical facts, including, but not limited to, statements about our expectations, beliefs, plans, designs, objectives, prospects, financial condition, assumptions, and future events or performance are forward-looking statements under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.\\nForward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties. Actual results may differ materially from those indicated by such forward-looking statements as a result of various important factors, including those discussed in Dynasil’s Annual Report on 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2018 filed on Friday with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Dynasil’s filings can be accessed on the Investor Relations section of the company’s website, www.dynasil.com.\\nAny forward-looking statements represent the company’s views as of today, December 26, 2018. These statements should not be relied upon as representing the company’s views as of any subsequent date. While Dynasil may elect to update forward-looking statements at some point in the future, the company specifically disclaims any obligation to do so.\\nNow, let me turn the call over to Peter Sulick.\\nPeter Sulick\\nThanks, Patty. Good afternoon, everyone. Thank you for joining us today to highlight our financial results and other activities for 2018 fiscal year. I regret the unfortunate timing of this call, as we were very tight with our SEC filings schedule this year.\\nIn preparation of our October 1st adoption of the so-called 606 revenue recognition rules, full implementation resulted in considerable additional work by the finance team and the auditors for year-end 2018. We apologize for any inconvenience having this call on December 26 has caused.\\nOn Friday, we released our Form 10-K and press release with summary results for our 2018 fiscal year. The press release includes a table showing our results for each of our segments: Optics, Innovation & Development and Biomedical for both this year and last. You may want to refer to these statements for a specific information during this call.\\nRob will provide further details on our results in a few minutes. I would like to begin by announcing our earnings for the year attributable to common stockholders was $1.8 million, or $0.10 per share. These results were driven in part by a 9% increase over prior year. The $3.4 million increase in revenue, resulted from a $3.8 million, or approximately 20% increase in revenue in our Optics segment, offset by a $0.4 million, or 2% decrease in revenue in our Innovation & Development segment.\\nFor financial reporting purposes, we have renamed our former Contract Research segment to Innovation & Development. This is reflective of the exciting new technology being developed at this segment’s business unit, RMD, particularly in the fields of material science, radiation detection, digital and magnetic imaging, laser optics and photonics.\\n\\nUsing decades of expertise in these fields, the team at RMD develops advanced technology in materials, sensors, detectors and prototype instruments that detect or measure radiation, light, magnetism or sound for use in security, medical and industrial applications. Dynasil has 78 patents granted and another 53 patents filed for and pending. The vast majority of these granted and pending patents are at RMD.\\nOur Optics segment experienced solid year-over-year revenue growth, with revenue increasing 20% over 2017. Efforts across all of our Optics businesses, as well as our new marketing team have resulted in this outstanding performance. We have not discussed it in-depth in the past, but during 2018, we invested over $1.6 million in a combination of capital, personnel and coating formula development for our infrared or IR initiative.\\nOf this amount, approximately $1.2 million was capital in the form of new coating, polishing and lapping equipment, much of which we designed in-house. We also dedicated and converted existing coating chambers to this effort, and we perfected coating formulas for numerous IR applications across multiple substrates. We now offer a very competitive product suite for the IR marketplace, including diamond-like coating capabilities.\\nWe also moved – we also worked on our in-house metrology, quality standards, processes, documentation, staff training and other operational needs necessary to service the multibillion dollar IR marketplace. While we had limited revenue during 2018, I’m happy to report that we have numerous prospects developing for the remainder of 2019 and beyond. We’re very optimistic about our IR opportunities, which we specifically identified as a strategic growth initiative in 2017 and actively pursued during fiscal 2018.\\nThe Innovation & Development segment’s 2% decrease in revenue, largely resulted from a reduction in NIH funding and a delay in our commercial revenue orders. As you know, we generate $16 million to $18 million in Innovation & Development segment revenue in a typical year. This year, uncertainty and disruptions in project funding, resulted in our yearly projected revenue being closer to $16 million, despite a substantial backlog.\\nWe are very dependent upon stability and predictability from our government customers and this is not uniform across the government agencies we service. Managing a project business dependent on direct billings to specific projects becomes challenging in this environment and requires active oversight.\\nCurrently, parts of the government, including one large agency we do significant work for, are shutdown as a result of the border wall impasse. This is a real-time case in point on the need for active management. The Innovation segment is also supplemented by product sales, which are also typically government dependent. Very often, it is difficult to predict with any accuracy when this revenue is going to be realized.\\nI’m happy to report the project backlog in the Innovation segment continues to remain strong into 2019, and we are hopeful that certain of the appropriation programs we are dependent upon for commercial revenue will be awarded during 2019.\\nThere’s a possibility that commercial revenue in this area could grow dramatically, but it is difficult to predict dependent upon a competitive bidding process with our commercial partners and is always dependent on a very long product development cycle. That said, we have some wonderful technology with exciting possibilities.\\nOur income from operations increased $0.9 million from a loss of operations of $0.6 million in fiscal year 2017 to income from operations of $0.3 million in fiscal year 2018. We previously mentioned about $400,000 in P&L costs we incurred during 2018 in advance of revenue for the IR initiative.\\n\\nIn addition, we have invested in a marketing team and marketing programs to expand our visibility, particularly in the digital marketing area. We are now active on Facebook, LinkedIn and other sites. Recently, we have relaunched our e-commerce site and have largely converted the Dynasil website to focus on e-commerce, as opposed to an investor portal.\\nAs announced last July, Xcede Technologies, Inc., our majority-owned subsidiary, that has halted clinical trial preparations and curtailed its operations in response to a termination notice received from Cook Biotech, Inc. This is a major disappointment on the eve of beginning clinical trials. Xcede had adequate capital to get through the clinical trial, but had never been successful despite multiple attempts at raising substantive direct funding.\\nFollowing the CBI termination, there was no appetite on the part of Dynasil or the angel investors to continue funding a new round in product development and essentially beginning the process over again. As a result, the decision was made to suspend operations.\\nOur innovation team at RMD is investigating funding for continued development of the Xcede Patch, specifically for wound care. We’ve also reengaged with our partners at CBI to assist in the process. There can be no assurances with respect to any such alternatives or that any additional outside funding to continue development of the Xcede Patch will be available to RMD.\\nWe will make an attempt. There is IP and science available to RMD, which could be promising, but it is a long shot. For 2018, Dynasil recognized approximately $1 million in Xcede cost on the P&L, which will not continue in the future due to the suspension of operations. I’m happy to discuss Xcede in more detail should anyone be interested during the Q&A session.\\nNow, let me turn the call over to Rob Bowdring, our CFO.\\nRobert Bowdring\\nThank you, Peter, and happy holidays to all of you who have joined us today. As Peter touched on most of the key items for the quarter, I will summarize a few additional points.\\nAs Peter noted, Dynasil’s revenue in 2018 was $40.7 million, as compared to $37.3 million in 2017. This 9% increase in revenue resulted from $3.8 million, or 20% increase in the revenue of our Optics segment, somewhat offset by the $400,000, or 2% decrease in revenue in our Innovation & Development segment.\\nMost of our Optics divisions improved over last year, particularly our New Jersey-based Fused Silica team as they responded to increased demand from customers in the semiconductor microlithography market, resulting in a very strong year for them.\\nAs Peter outlined, Innovation & Development’s revenue decreased by 2% to $17.4 million in the year ended September 30, 2018 from $18 million in the same period in 2017, largely resulting from a reduction of NIH funding and a delay in our commercial revenue orders. NIH continues to be one of our top five RMD customers, it was just down versus years passed.\\nAs Peter mentioned, our Innovation & Development backlog remained strong at year-end at over $31 million and it has become even stronger since September 30. Overall, gross profit for the fiscal year increased to $1.3 million to $15.2 million, or 37% of revenue, compared to $13.9 million, or the same 37% of revenue for last year.\\nThe Optic segment’s gross profit as a percent of revenue in fiscal year 2018 decreased slightly to 33%, as compared with 2017’s gross profit of 34%. The gross profit in 2018 was $7.7 million, an increase of $1.1 million, or 17% as a result of higher revenue during the 12 months that ended September 30.\\nBoth gross profit dollars and gross profit as a percent of revenue for the Innovation & Development segment improved in fiscal year 2018 compared to 2017, largely as a result of the mix of active contracts during 2018, which carried stronger margins, because more internal resources were utilized rather than subcontractors.\\n\\nGross profit dollars in this segment increased to $7.6 million during 2018, up from $7.3 million in 2017. Gross profit as a percent of revenue improved to 43% in 2000 [sic] [2018] compared to 41% in 2017.\\nAll of the above resulted in a very substantial turnaround in the company’s income from operations, which for the year ended 2018 was $300,000, compared to a loss from operations of $600,000 in the same period of 2017 and $900,000 improvement in this key metric.\\nNow a word about taxes. Total income tax expense was actually a benefit of $1.6 million in fiscal year 2018, as compared to a benefit of $2.7 million in fiscal 2017. The 2018 benefit resulted from a pickup in the second quarter related to the Research & Experimentation, or R&E tax credits that the company earned in the years 2013 through 2016 and a benefit in the fourth quarter for the release of the company’s tax reserve for state deferred tax assets that were being carried on the balance sheet that now expected to be used in the foreseeable future.\\nThese positive items were offset by the first quarter expense from the effect of the 2017 Tax Act. Last year’s benefit was related to the deconsolidation of Xcede for federal income tax purposes and the release of the federal tax valuation allowance, again, as we now expect to have taxable income and we plan to use these tax assets in the foreseeable future.\\nAs a result of the items mentioned previously, our net income for the year ended September 30, 2018 was $1.6 million, compared to net income of $1.9 million in the prior year. I would like to spend a minute picking up on Peter’s opening statement and restate our apology for splitting the timing of our annual report filed on Form 10-K in this call during this last week of the year.\\nThe company had been working on the adoption of the new 606 accounting revenue recognition policy throughout this year knowing that it was required to be in place as of October 1. Unfortunately, it took considerable amount of extra effort much more than we expected, especially at year-end.\\nAs we went through the process, additional steps were taken by both ourselves and the audit team to review revenue under both the old method for 2018 and the new methods that starting with this new fiscal year. As a result of these reviews, we realized there was very little difference in the way we are recording and presenting total revenue during fiscal 2018 and going forward under this new guidance.\\nAs we indicated in the 10-K, the difference to our financial statements was insignificant. What did come from the additional audit reviews was that, there was revenue of a few contracts that were being counted for in the same way as the majority of our other contracts when they should have been treated differently, resulting in revenue recognition adjustments in manual system error corrections.\\nEven though the net impact to operating income was only $32,000, these errors were viewed as a breakdown in internal controls, causing us to determine that we had a material weakness. We have already begun the improvements necessary to implement changes to eliminate these errors and will quickly correct this deficiency in the near-term.\\nWith that, Peter and I will be happy to take your questions. Mark?\\nQuestion-and-Answer Session\\nOperator\\nThank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of [Robert Cooper] [ph]. The line is now open.\\nUnidentified Analyst\\nHi, good evening. You keep mentioning the infrared business. What kind of opportunities you foresee over the next couple of years?\\nPeter Sulick\\nI’ll take that one, Rob. So, Robert, the infrared business is a multibillion dollar business overall, which Dynasil has not participated in that at all, and we recognize that we weren’t involved in this market. It was a growing market. There were certain participants in our regional area in the Northeast that were dropping the business, and there was a consolidation going on among those people in California and elsewhere.\\n\\nSo it opened up a really wonderful opportunity for us. We were able to hire some people last year that have deep experience in infrared optics, and that opened up for us the ability to go after some of the key customers that had previously been customers of some of these other operations that closed down.\\nBut in order to take advantage of that, we needed to have a couple of systems in place that we didn’t previously have. And so, we had to design and build some of those systems or have built some of those systems in the lead time for acquiring some of these kinds of capital assets is very long.\\nIn fact, one of the coating chambers that we needed to acquire like it’s almost nine months between the time the order was placed, we actually had the machine in operation. So there’s a long lead time in this business, but there’s also a very long tail. Once you get into it, you tend to be in Defense Department-related optical systems and they tend to have very long life cycle.\\nSo during 2018, we perfected our various processes, we put in place the necessary hardware that we needed and then we began to actively sell to a number of different very large OEM customers starting in the beginning of this year. These kinds of systems go into helicopters, gun sites, tanks, et cetera, et cetera, large optical systems that tend to be solid, stable operation – or solid and stable business for a relatively long period of time, so that’s why we’re excited about it.\\nThe addressable market for us is somewhere in the $100 million to $200 million range and meaning that, while this is a multibillion dollar marketplace, what we can realistically go after is in the $100 billion to $200 billion range. We are projecting that we can get a small fraction of that over the next couple of years, and we’re hopeful that we will and will be meaningful to us if we are able to do that.\\nUnidentified Analyst\\nOkay. In regards to you had hired a few months, maybe six months ago, a Vice President of Marketing, you guys keep incurring further expenses on that. I mean, what do you expect to get out of that?\\nPeter Sulick\\nWell, we didn’t have any marketing department at all in the entire company. So whatever minor amount of marketing activities we were engaged with was really just picked up by certain of us as we could fill in. And the sales cycle these days is completely different than what it had been 20 years ago or 30 years ago or maybe even 10 years ago.\\nAnd so digital marketing becomes extremely important, not just for image purposes, but for the sales cycle itself. Most people, who have done a lot of research through the Internet before they actually contact us for pricing or long order runs and things like that.\\nSo because we were not active in this whole digital marketing area, when anyone would do a Google search, for example, even though we are manufacturers of some of these very important products, like gratings as an example, we wouldn’t appear on the first three or four pages, because we just simply didn’t have enough content on the Internet to move some of our units, whether it’s Optometrics or Dynasil or Evaporated Metal Films or whoever up to the first page, and it’s very rare that people get past the first or second page in a search.\\nSo we recognize that if we were going to be, let’s say, more active in some direct – in the direct sales area, we had to advance our search results to the first page or the second page. And this digital marketing guys are very actively involved in the development of content, specifically to do that.\\nIn addition, we launched a website for e-commerce and across four of our divisions. We serially launched it starting with Optometrics and then we launched three other divisions after that. And it became very apparent that the website itself was not optimized for e-commerce. It was not contemporary. We did the best we could with it, but we needed some professional guidance and how to optimize the website. And these guys got directly involved in that and we launched our new website literally just two or three weeks ago.\\n\\nSo we now have a different look and a much easier process to actually go in and find what you’re looking for and then ultimately check out. So we’re very hopeful that over a longer period of time, not immediately, but maybe over two or three years that all of this effort will result in increased revenue. So – and we’re pretty optimistic so far with what we’ve seen come out in the marketing department.\\nUnidentified Analyst\\nI have two more for you. With the little news that we do get, I see you’re publicly disclosing all of your ISO certifications.\\nPeter Sulick\\nRight.\\nUnidentified Analyst\\nWhat is that really about? And why as an investor, why should we care or…?\\nPeter Sulick\\nWell, it’s very important- extremely important actually, because it’s very difficult to get certain kinds of orders from customers that are interested in quality control and things like that if you do not have ISO certification. And so we have been very active in getting ISO certified or recertified as the ISO rules change, and we’ve done that now for every – virtually every one of our units.\\nWe still have one that isn’t, which we’re going to work on theirs. But it’s a box that gets checked off by, let’s say, a purchasing manager, Robert, and if you do not have it, it becomes a very negative impact on the potential sale. So ISO is important in the purchasing world and in the manufacturing world for quality and other purposes.\\nUnidentified Analyst\\nYou’re right. My last question for you is the valuation of the company seems quite ridiculous compared to the revenues, et cetera. What’s the approximate book value?\\nPeter Sulick\\nRob’s probably a better one to answer this one, but I’ll take a shot at. I think, our book value is in the range of $20 million – $22 million. Rob, do you have that number?\\nRobert Bowdring\\nYes, that’s a – that sounds about right. Let me…\\nPeter Sulick\\nYes.\\nRobert Bowdring\\n…go, go ahead.\\nPeter Sulick\\nI think, Robert, in terms of a per share price, it’s around $1.20 to $1.25 a share, and I think that translates to about $22 million or so.\\nRobert Bowdring\\nYes. Well, $21 million – $20.7 million.\\nPeter Sulick\\nOkay.\\nUnidentified Analyst\\nAll right. That’s all the questions I have. I appreciate it.\\nPeter Sulick\\nAll right. Thank you, Robert.\\nUnidentified Analyst\\nThank you.\\nOperator\\n[Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Joe Furst of Furst Associates. Your line is now open.\\nJoe Furst - Furst Associates\\nGood afternoon, Peter. I just wanted to make sure I have something straight here. Last year, it seems you were able to make $0.10 a share, even though you lost about $1 million from Xcede, is that correct?\\nRobert Bowdring\\nThat’s correct, Joe.\\nJoe Furst\\nGood. So if everything else were equal, you make a lot more money next year. And also I guess some people saw it, but I don’t know if everybody did that. You have enough confidence in this company to spend $1 a share from buying a 1.5 shares from this state of the foundry. So I want to commend you for doing that. It certainly demonstrates the shareholders that you have confidence in the company. And also can you make a couple of comments about the future of the Optometrics area of the approach you think you can get there and where it might come from?\\nPeter Sulick\\nWell, so we did – I did spend a fair amount of time talking about IR. And IR – our IR business is a combination of the sales team is actually located at Optometrics, but the manufacturing is done in Ithaca, New York at our EMF operation. So it’s a combination of the two. The actual revenue is going to be recorded at EMF. So we have the expenses being incurred partly at Optometrics and then the sales will be recorded at EMF.\\nAlthough from the point of view of the public, it’s all one Dynasil entity obviously. Where we’re seeing significant growth, Joe, is in our Optometrics subsidiary in our core business at Optometrics and also in our core business, and Rob mentioned briefly, our Fused Silica. There is tremendous demand right now for optics component products, and we are very high-quality manufacturer of those.\\n\\nWe provide product to a wide range of customers in that space, including catalog companies that buy from us for catalog sales. And the demand has just been escalating significantly and we don’t see that actually abating. So we’re quite encouraged by this growth in demand, which by the way, our 20% growth in optics doesn’t include any growth at all for IR historically.\\nSo we’ve got no IR growth last year, but we anticipate getting some growth in that space this year. So it’s just a generally broad increase in demand across the optics space and it’s pretty encouraging at the moment.\\nJoe Furst\\nOkay, great. Thank you. Keep up the good work. I appreciate it.\\nPeter Sulick\\nYou’re welcome.\\nOperator\\nAnd I’m showing no further questions at this time. I would now like to turn the call back to Peter Sulick for closing remarks.\\nPeter Sulick\\nThank you. Happy holidays to everyone, and I look forward to speaking with you in a month-and-a-half or so when we talk about our first quarter. Good night.\\nOperator\\nLadies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today’s conference. This does conclude the program, and you may all disconnect. Everyone, have a great day.']}\n"

Last week President Trump signed the 2018 Farm Bill into law, and with it gave a legal status to hemp and hemp derived CBD. This could be big news for Youngevity (YGYI) investors in a material way. Prior to the passage of this bill, hemp was a regulated substance. That barrier is now gone, and with it some of the red tape that hemp companies have had to deal with. As many of my readers know, Youngevity is a growing direct selling company with a growing coffee business to boot. In 2018 the company entered the CBD space and announced intentions of creating a field-to-finish hemp based product line inclusive of CBD oil products. For those less familiar with the company, you may want to read a recent article titled, \"Youngevity Could Be The Most Undervalued And Safest CBD Play On The Market\". In very simple terms, the 2018 Farm Bill made hemp and hemp based CBD legal. An important point of clarity is that CBD derived from marijuana is still a scheduled substance and is mired in legal ambiguity. Despite the fact that several states have legalized marijuana in some form (medical and/or recreational), the plant is still a scheduled drug in the eyes of the Federal Government and thus could be subject to a lot of scrutiny. One major shift we will see is in finances related to hemp and CBD. When hemp was a scheduled substance it was difficult for companies to operate in the financial world. Even basic banking services were difficult to establish. Things like transport over state lines also presented problems. With a newly minted legal status, companies that grow hemp, process it, and sell finished products at retail can do business just as simply as a corn farmer. Youngevity has been exploring the acquisition of existing hemp operations in a desire to replicate its already successful field-to-finish coffee model. With coffee, the company grows the product, sells green coffee, sells roasted coffee, offers its own branded coffee, and even manufactures finished coffee for others. This experience will prove to be very valuable as the company grows and expands its presence in the CBD space.\\n In the world of CBD products, hemp based CBD products will enjoy a much easier path to market than marijuana based CBD products. Free from hurdles, red tape and banking issues, hemp based products can literally explode onto the scene in 2019 like never before. Any company that has established an early foothold into the hemp based CBD space can have an advantage. Any company that can offer full vertical integration has an advantage that is even greater. Youngevity is poised for getting a fully integrated vertical operation up and running in the near term. Investors should know that there is opportunity in knowledge. With the holidays and political issues of the day, inclusive of a government shut down, the Farm Bill has not yet received much press. Combine that with the overall sell-off in the markets in late 2018, and hemp based investment plays could be providing the best entry point possible. It is virtually certain that those close to the business (from farmers to retailers) have now started implementing long planned actions. It is also virtually certain that a host of new players will attempt to enter the market now that hemp has legal status. The likely advantage goes to the players in the space that have been planning moves for years rather than over a cup of coffee in the last week. While I would have loved to see Youngevity already closed on a hemp farm by now, the story is still a positive one. The passage of the Farm Bill may be the catalyst that can jump-start actions within the space, see capital deals happen, and even attract institutional investors. I anticipate swift action by Youngevity in the CBD space, and think that 2019 will be a very interesting year for this company as well as those invested in it. Stay Tuned!

What I discovered during this deep dive was that after shares of the firm tanked in recent weeks as oil plummeted, the stock appeared to be one of the cheapest entities I have seen. Not only that, but its debt picture was not as bad as that of some similarly priced rivals, meaning there could be attractive upside, especially once crude prices recover. Now, to finish my thesis, I figured it would be wise to dive in and provide for you all a cash flow sensitivity analysis that will illustrate, for this year and next, what kind of volatility in cash flow the firm could be subject to based on various crude and natural gas price scenarios. What I found was that, for the most part, it’s hard to find a bad outcome for Whiting. Setting the ground rules In this analysis, I relied entirely on the same assumptions and the same model as in my aforementioned article on Whiting. The firm’s capital structure is assumed to remain unchanged as of the time of this writing, and production is forecasted to grow at a rate of 10% per annum into perpetuity. It is possible that output could grow slower than this 10% figure, but seeing as how this article deals with only this year and the next, the implications of management falling short that figure are nominal. In terms of pricing, natural gas is assumed to range between $2.50 per Mcf and $6 per Mcf (with the lower end of this far more likely than the higher end), while oil is assumed to range between $35 per barrel and $85 per barrel (I believe $70-80 is an appropriate target for WTI crude), but it’s best to offer a wide range for the sake of conservatism).\\n 2018 looks stable Let’s start first with this year. The way my model is set up, it assumes that any price put in for 2018 will be the average price that oil and / or gas will be for the fourth quarter of the year, while all realized prices for the prior three quarters will remain unchanged from what has been realized already. Because of this, the degree of volatility illustrated in it is actually remarkably small, no matter what kinds of prices oil might come in at. Take a look, for instance, at the table below. \\n\\n *Created by Author In the table, you can see that if oil averages $50 per barrel while natural gas averages $3 per Mcf (both likely too conservative compared to what will actually happen this year, but close enough), EBITDA should be about $1.34 billion. If, however, crude were to soar to $70 for the average price for the current quarter, EBITDA would climb by less than $20 million to $1.36 billion. Even in an ultra-bearish scenario where crude falls to $35 per barrel (a price that is almost certain to never happen in the foreseeable future) and natural gas were to tank to $2.50 per Mcf, EBITDA would still be a fairly robust $1.32 billion for the year. For investors looking at leverage data, this is actually quite positive. Under the bearish scenario provided, and with net debt of $2.82 billion as of the time of this writing, Whiting’s net debt / EBITDA ratio would end 2018 at just 2.13. Under the bullish outcome I provided, it would be 2.07. Of course, EBITDA is not always a great metric to look at by itself, so in the table below, I provided you with operating cash flow figures for the business. \\n\\n\\n *Created by Author According to my model, the results here are similar. Under the base case with $50 oil, operating cash flow for 2018 should be around $1.15 billion, while the bullish outcome suggests $1.16 billion. Even the most bearish outcome offered up is pretty attractive, with operating cash flow coming in just under $1.13 billion. This here is incredibly noteworthy, because with management intent on spending $750 million this year on capex, almost any price for oil and gas for 2018 will result in positive free cash flow. In the bearish scenario, even, this figure should come out to $378 million. 2019 is a lot more volatile Due to a history of poor hedging, combined with the wide ranges my sensitivity analysis tests for, the picture for 2019 could be a much more wild ride for shareholders. If, for instance, you look at the table below, you will see that if oil averages $50 per barrel, while natural gas averages $3 per Mcf, EBITDA for 2019 should total $1.30 billion. That’s a nice start, especially since the figure is higher than this year’s target at that price, but the picture could very well change wildly moving forward. \\n\\n *Created by Author You see, in the event that oil tanks to $35 per barrel while natural gas averages $2.50 per Mcf, the cash flow picture for Whiting would deteriorate considerably, with EBITDA declining to just $899 million. If, on the other hand, the bullish case for crude ends up being correct, the upside is tremendous. Under that scenario, with oil at $70 per barrel and natural gas at $3 per Mcf, EBITDA would soar to nearly $1.81 billion for 2019. From a debt picture, this creates a lot more uncertainty, but even within the wide range of options my model looks at, investors should be fine from a leverage perspective. If, for instance, we see the base case play out, Whiting’s net debt / EBITDA picture would come out to 2.17. Under the bearish scenario it would be 3.14, and under the bullish one it would be 1.56. In this current energy environment, a figure of 2 or lower is considered incredibly healthy, a figure of 2 to 3 is considered alright, and a figure north of 3 suggests that management has some work today. However, Whiting’s fundamental picture is close enough that a 3.14 leverage ratio isn’t anything to worry about. To bring that within the 3 or lower reading, management would need to reduce debt by just $123 million or grow EBITDA by $41 million. Changes in cost structure between now and then and/or asset sales or stock sales could provide for any shortcoming there, if need be.\\n The last graph, shown below, gives us a look at Whiting’s operating cash flow for 2019. According to my model, the base case would give us nearly $1.11 billion in operating cash flow, the bearish one $702 million, and the bullish one an impressive $1.61 billion. Assuming management wants to keep capex unchanged next year versus this year, the firm then, on a free cash flow basis, would be $48 million shy of neutrality, but in the grand scheme of things, it’s not so far off that investors should be terribly concerned. \\n\\n *Created by Author Takeaway Based on the data provided, the picture facing Whiting is quite nice under most scenarios. In recent months, shares have been incredibly volatile because of changing expectations when it comes to energy prices, and that makes sense to some degree - but as my model illustrates, the upside for shareholders, even under an outcome that is more bearish than any that I have seen suggested, could just be delayed as a temporary wash. If, on the other hand, energy prices appreciate to any material extent, investors could be looking at some really nice upside from here.\\nA community of oil and natural gas investors with a hankering for the E&P space: Crude Value Insights is an exclusive community of investors who have a taste for oil and natural gas firms.

That ideology was non-interventionist, laissez faire. Responding to the rise in the stock markets during the 1920\\'s stock boom, the Federal Reserve began to raise interest rates to curb speculation, but to no avail. Mellon was in favor of additional increases in interest rates in 1929 as well. The Fed raised rates to 6% by September of 1929. Stocks continued to burst higher until finally peaking in October. At the onset of the crash of \\'29, Mellon had little sympathy for the speculators but did urge for a reduction in interest rates, which the Fed did. By mid 1930, they would reach 2%. \\n\\nMellon was also in favor of across the board tax cuts and did not object to trade tariffs, but objected to the Government interfering otherwise. Mellon, like many who believe in the natural order of things, believed that recessions were part of the natural business cycle as they provided a purge of the unworthy or less competent. Having experienced similar recessions in the past, like in 1873, 1907 and 1920, America always came out stronger.\\n Herbert Hoover wrote in his memoirs, that Mellon had advised him in the early days of the 1929 crash, in Hoover\\'s words, this famous advise: \"liquidate labor, liquidate stocks, liquidate the farmers, liquidate real estate. Purge the rottenness out of the system. High costs of living and high living will come down. ... enterprising people will pick up the wrecks from less competent people.\" This time, however, the economy continued to slump into 1931.  In a previous article I wrote about the potential for a Sovereign Debt Crisis here in the US, I wrote the following: My favorite economic history author is the late Peter Bernstein. In his 2000 book, \"The Power of Gold, A History of An Obsession,\" he wrote in great detail about the events leading up to the sovereign debt crisis of 1931. pg. 310 The fuses were in place. They were lit on May 11 when the explosive news of the failure of the Creditanstalt Bank in Vienna stunned the world. This was Austria\\'s largest commercial bank by far, holding more than half of all Austrian bank deposits. Today we would call the Creditanstalt too large to fail. It was too large to fail in 1931, too, and the Austrian government had to bail it out. But to no avail. The Creditanstalt failure, in the words of the British Treasury official Ralph Hawtrey, \"sent a terrible spasm of panic through the financial centers of the world.\" That was how the sovereign debt crisis began in 1931 that proved horribly deflationary and is what made the great depression great. It should be appreciated that the European defaults led to many US banks defaulting as US banks held bonds of European banks and Countries. As those bonds defaulted, the banks in the US went under and that led to savers losing their money. Banks then had no money to lend.  This led to Mellon and Hoover too becoming loathed in their favorability.  Democrats would go on to win both the House and the Presidency with the election of Roosevelt in 1932 leading to tremendous Government intervention.  History may now view Mellon\\'s non-interventionist ideology unfavorably to the response to the beginnings of the 1930\\'s great depression.\\n I think not. I think the idea of purging the rottenness out of the system is healthy and necessary. Just like cutting off the branches that don\\'t bear fruit like we do in our backyard apple trees every season. Purge The Rottenness As the Fed raises rates and provides guidance for 2 more rate hikes in 2019, the markets have viewed this unfavorably.  They should as it will help bring about a purge in the so called rottenness in the system. These are unproductive debts that should be liquidated and businesses that should be failed.  The great expense of rottenness in the system is low productivity growth.  Forest Fires \\n\\nSource: LA Times California experiences some of the worst forest fires in 2018 then they ever had.  One of the reasons cited as for why these fires were so destructive was due to government regulation that prohibited the clearing of thicket and deadwood. I recall back in 2011 when Arizona had a massive fire called the \"Wallow Fire.\" When I was reading about it, a local resident was blasting the U.S. Forest Service for mismanagement. This local resident was a 5th generation cattle rancher who knew a thing or two about forest fires as he had predicted such a large fire would happen as soon as the conditions were right. I predicted years ago that when the weather conditions were right, the Gila Wilderness, a waste of natural resources and the Gila National Forest would go up in flames. Much to my sorrow that day has gone,” Emil Kiehne wrote in a letter to his son. “All of this is a result of overprotection of our natural resources, timber and grass that has grown into a dog hair thicket that cannot be contained. The USFS must go back to allowing multiple use of forest lands to prevent forest fires.”\\n Source: Townhall.com President Trump cited the very same idea as for the reasons for the exacerbated forest fires in CA. In response, his administration has been pushing for measures that give far more flexibility to loggers and the U.S. Forest Service to clear up brush, dead and diseased trees rapidly from forests to keep the fuel levels down. In the most recent Farm Bill, provisions were included for money to do just that! The concept of clearing up dead wood in and diseased trees in a forest simply means that the capacity for more sunlight to reach the ground floor of the forest will improve. That will spring new life into the forest, provide more food for the animals and create a healthier ecosystem. The U.S. Forest Service website has a picture of just that: \\n\\nIn an economy, all those \"green shoots\" represent new businesses and new employees, some who will have a bright future with lots of growth potential. Here is a pic of a forest that is ready to burn. There is little room for new growth at the base of this forest. \\n\\nSource: abc.net.au This picture comes from a story where local residents are concerned about just that: A large fire ready to go.  Delinquency and Active Participation The best measure of success of the purging of the rottenness out of the system is to see a bump in the delinquency rate and an increase in the active participation rate. The delinquency rate would be our tell on the purging of the inferior debts in our economy. These inferior debt would be painful to the current holders of those debt, but they would then be replaced with debts of new enterprises and new consumer loans.\\n \\n\\n\\n\\nIn both these cases, commercial and industrial loans as well as consumer loans, have been experiencing well below average rates of delinquency. With the rise of rates and the potential slowdown of net new loan growth, both of these should be heading higher. Enterprising men and woman will pick up the wrecks. At the same time, using the same analogy, due to our economy being full of businesses that are not helping with productivity and unproductive loans, the percent of people in America that are of working age and participating in the workforce, which includes being both employed or unemployed, needs to move up. Just as the clearing of the deadwood in the forest opens up the floor to new growth, the same should apply to the economy. \\n\\nAttempting to balance the trade deficit means a lot more work will need to be done here on US soil.  There is no doubt the jobs are currently there for ambitious. The real measure of success will be when we measure productivity rates 3-5 years from now. Conclusion While I am sharing Andrew Mellon\\'s ideology and expressing my own opinion in that I agree with it, I appreciate that Fed Chairman Powell has not expressed the same level of ideology, at least in his own words. \\n However, by his actions, it does appear he\\'s willing to push rates up and incur some pain to the \"speculators\" and not show too much sympathy. Continuing with this policy should prove deflationary, it should prove destructive to both house prices and share prices, it should prove higher delinquency in both consumer and business loans too. Beyond that, in the times ahead, our economy should be in better position with more productive debts and hopefully a higher labor activity rate. Of course, an event like that of the Austrian bank failure in 1931 could again happen and derail a healthy purge but instead bring about a far more disastrous event. As of now, we are just at the beginning of what could become a purging of the rottenness and thus, better opportunities for investments lie ahead.

Explanations for the recent sell-off abound, and most notably perhaps, the most common themes for the recent sharp correction has been the Fed raising interest rates and Donald Trump’s twitter feed. Every day, media pundits and traders look for a “why” in response to market moves. The trade war, Brexit news, unrest in Paris, and whether or not someone wearing a tie thinks that Donald Trump will be impeached. Russian collusion, rigged elections (or not)... the endless list of \"news\" goes on and on. Can news events create buyers and sellers? Of course they can (and do). On the other hand, it is my opinion that a steady diet of financial news will lead me to over-trade. Headline trading is often faded. I only very rarely watch CNBC; these are the same people who were giving tutorials on how to trade Ripple a year ago. Increasingly, I pay less attention to the financial “news,” and instead, focus on price action and order flow in the markets. The reason for a market going up is that there were more buyers that day than sellers. If a market goes down, then there were more sellers than buyers. Order flow drives markets. It really is that simple. The Perfect Storm In 1991, a nor’easter formed off of the U.S. east coast and absorbed Hurricane Grace. These weather patterns\\' action evolved back into a small, unnamed hurricane. In the middle of the storm, the fishing vessel Andrea Gail sank, killing her crew of six and inspiring the book, and later movie, The Perfect Storm. \\n\\n\\n The phrase “perfect storm” has now become a part of our jargon. A “perfect storm” occurs when related or unrelated events line up to create an outcome that was unexpected. In hindsight, we might find that the outcome may have been predicted with better modeling. With 20/20 hindsight, we might look back on last week and discover that there was a perfect storm brewing in the S&P 500. S&P futures rollover, SPX and SPY option expiration, along with spiking gamma may have contributed to cascading sell orders in the stock market overall. S&P 500 Order Flow S&P futures trade with quarterly expirations on the CME Group exchange. The futures contracts expire the third Friday morning of the final month in each quarter, and in this case, expired on December 21st. Traders who wanted to maintain long exposure to the S&P futures were therefore rolling over their position in S&P futures by selling the December contract and buying the March 2019 contract. This is one form of selling order flow that hit the markets last week. Allow me to reiterate. This rollover only happens once per quarter. In addition, on December 21st, there was critical monthly and quarterly options expiration for S&P futures, SPX options (traded on CBOE), as well SPY options (not to mention NQ options, RUT options, QQQ options, IWM options, etc.). Since most options are either unwound or expire worthless, many options contracts had to either be unwound or rolled forward. Lastly, a spike in market gamma may have forced option sellers to liquidate long positions and/or sell the S&P 500 index in order to hedge or close out options positions. If so, the sell-off prior to and during December 21st may have been due to forced selling. Once the price levels in all of these indices broke technical support, it is likely that other traders headed for the exits as fear made its way through the markets. The fear trade is not likely over, and we should expect stocks to trade with continuing volatility for the weeks ahead. Price Magnets\\n Since February 2018, we have been publishing the Price Magnet for the S&P 500 index. The Price Magnet theory suggests that the value of the S&P index will mean-revert to the delta- and gamma-neutral levels prior to the option expiration date, as shown by the black squares below. Please note that neutral gamma spiked to way out of range prior to the option expiration date (more later). \\n\\n (Source: Viking Analytics) We have recorded mean reversion in many different markets with this indicator. Nevertheless, as was demonstrated last week, the Price Magnet can reverse polarity as the price moves out of range, resulting in something similar to a short squeeze in and around the option expiration date. In this case, our data suggests that last week represented a “long squeeze” in the S&P 500. Gamma Grab As the option expiration for ES, SPX and SPY came nearer, there was a considerable amount of put options that were deep in the money. Specifically, the put sellers in aggregate were holding a considerable liability, which can be expressed in terms of a large positive gamma (see graph above). In order to cover this liability, the put sellers either had to buy back the puts (during a period of less liquidity in the options) or sell the S&P index (in any form) in order to close out or hedge the position. This was a very interesting revelation, as we have only been tracking the neutral gamma levels since February 2018. To be specific, I believe that the neutral delta and gamma levels represent a gravitational force that will usually help to steer price towards the Price Magnet. Nevertheless, when price moves out of the orbit of the Price Magnet, then it can create a liquidation event as option sellers struggle to get their trading books back \"onside.\"\\n Key Pivot Levels The chart below shows key weekly, monthly and quarterly pivot levels that have been produced by Brett Freeze. Brett is the founder of Global Technical Analysis, and formerly managed a portfolio of over $200 billion for Bank of America. This week’s key pivot levels are shown in black, monthly pivot levels are shown in blue and quarterly pivot levels are shown in red. One key takeaway is the very large ranges between pivots. Brett also recently tweeted (prior to Wednesday\\'s rally) that the lower pivot was his downside exhaustion level for December 2018. \\n\\n (Source: TradingView) Final Notes Last week, I wrote an article which outlined my long position in SPY into option expiration, and I also cautioned readers that additional downside could occur if the 2547 level was breached to the downside. We closed out last week\\'s position with an average 0.7% loss after the Federal reserve announcement moved the markets lower. We opened another long position in SPY this morning at $234.44, selling January $250 strike calls to capture a relatively high option premium.

At $22.46 the company shares have fallen around 61% from their 52-week high and now trade at 6.0x P/E based on forward earnings estimates. While the company is highly cyclical being a manufacturer of high priced luxury and aspirational products, Winnebago has earned a respectable ROE of 12.3% over the past decade. With the shares now trading at a price to book value of 1.34x, this brand name manufacturer is starting to look appealing.  \\n\\nWGO data by YChartsIntroduction to the Company Many readers are probably familiar with the Winnebago brand of mobile home recreational vehicles. The Company builds a wide range of quality motorhomes, travel trailers, fifth wheel products and boats, under the Winnebago, Grand Design, and Chris-Craft brands. Since being founded in Iowa in 1958, the company has grown to have sales of over $2B in fiscal year 2018 with production facilities in Iowa, Indiana, Oregon, Minnesota and Florida. The company also recently diversified their product offerings by moving into the marine industry with the 2018 purchase of Chris-Craft, one of the world's most well-known boat brands with a heritage dating back to 1874.    A Profitable And Growing Business Winnebago's strong operations have allowed the company to achieve average return on equity (ROE) and return on invested capital (ROIC) of 12.3% and 11.7%, respectively, over the past decade. While the company is cyclical along with the industry, this average level of profitability is well above my rule of thumb of 9% ROIC, allowing me to be confident that, in my opinion, the company is able to maintain and continue to increase its intrinsic value over a business cycle.\\n   \\n\\n Source data from Morningstar A further benefit to the company above these historical returns is the fact that being primarily a U.S. company, Winnebago recorded a tax rate of 23.3% in the fourth quarter 2018 compared to a rate of 32.3% in the prior year with the reduction related to the lower federal tax rate enacted in accordance with the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. Also, as guided by management in the Q1 2019 conference call, the acquisition of Chris-Craft is expected to be immediately accretive to Winnebago’s Fiscal 2019 EPS if all goes to plan. Hugely Cyclical As a company building high price luxury aspirational products, Winnebago's sales are highly cyclical along with the broader economy. From 2007 to 2009, the company saw their sales fall around 75% from $870M in 2007 to $212M in 2009. This large decline resulted in the dramatic 59.2% negative return on equity in 2009 as seen in the previous graph because the business is exposed to large fixed costs as a manufacturer. This is one of the most cyclical businesses I have ever seen. But that being said, in my opinion, Winnebago still earns an ROIC that meets my minimum requirement. With a brand that has been around pretty much since cars advanced to luxury camping, and buying one of the most quintessential boat brands, this company and its brands are probably here to stay.  Conservatively Leveraged Winnebago currently looks to be in a strong financial position with the company less financially leveraged than at the beginning of the decade when they had to deal with the fallout from the financial crisis. With financial leverage currently at 1.85x and its interest coverage ratio a healthy 9.0x in the trailing twelve month period, the company looks ready to handle the next cyclical downturn.\\n \\n\\n Source data from Morningstar This is the kind of low leverage that I like to see in a cyclical business. With leverage looking conservative, I would now like to see management start to redirect excess cash flow to shareholders through higher dividends or share repurchases. Any more acquisitions from the company would put me on alert as Winnebago has yet to fully digest their 2018 purchase of Chris-Craft and they should work on cementing the strong brands the company already has. How about the Dividend? At first glance, Winnebago’s current annualized dividend rate of $0.44 per share represents an increase of 10% over the annual dividend of $0.40 paid in FY 2018. However, after cutting its dividend to zero from $0.48 in 2008, the company only started paying a dividend again in 2015. With EPS of $3.22 over the trailing twelve month period, the current $0.44 annualized dividend seems to represents a negligible 13.7% payout but this is only the case if consumer spending does not deteriorate dramatically pulling profits down along with it.  Getting a Sense of Valuation I always like to examine the relationship between average ROE and price-to-book value. This relationship is especially important for cyclical companies which are more profitable in the end of the cycle. This ratio is something I consider similar to Shiller's CAPE ratio but a little simpler to calculate in my opinion. It examines the average ROE over a business cycle and adjusts that ROE for the price investors are currently paying for the company's book value or equity per share. \\n\\n\\n Source data from Morningstar With Winnebago earning an average ROE of 12.3% over the past decade and the shares currently trading at a price to book value of 1.34x when the price is $22.43, this would yield an adjusted ROE of 9.2% for an investor's equity at that purchase price, if history repeats itself. This is right around the 9% that I like to see. Even adding my maximum 3% growth rate for such a brand name, would represent long-term potential total return of an estimated 12.2%. Take Away While Winnebago is highly cyclical being a manufacturer of high priced luxury and aspirational products, the company has earned a respectable ROE and ROIC of 12.3% and 11.7% over the past decade. With financial leverage now lower than during the financial crisis, the company looks well prepared to enter the next sales decline. Value investors might want to put this brand name manufacturer on their watch-list as this cyclical company is getting more enticing by the day.

Unfortunately, on Wednesday, the FOMC statement was not dovish, as I had anticipated. The Fed not only raised its key interest rate 0.25%, but also signaled two additional key interest rate hikes in 2019. At his press conference, Fed Chairman Jerome Powell did nothing to calm financial markets. Although the Fed lowered its inflation forecast, their forecast was still way too high, ignoring all of the recent commodity price deflation. Here’s a link to my podcast on Wednesday, and yet again on Thursday. So even though the Fed is providing guidance of higher rates in 2019, Treasury yields were falling in the wake of its FOMC statement. Confused? I cannot say enough how perplexed I am about why the Fed is ignoring obvious market forces and a lack of inflation. It is very odd for Treasury yields to move in the opposite direction of the Fed’s guidance, so I will be rooting for falling market rates to continue to derail the Fed’s intended interest rate hikes in 2019 – since the Fed does not like to invert the yield curve. Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin Goes on the Warpath for Fiscal Sanity Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin has said he wants to conduct an inter-agency review of the current market structure. Specifically, on Tuesday in a Bloomberg interview, Mnuchin said, “a normal trading day now is a 500-point range. A lot of that has to do with market structure, and that’s something we’re going to take a look at.” Mnuchin added that he will ask the Financial Stability Oversight Council, which he heads, to study stock market volatility. The most revealing statement was that he said, “In my opinion, market structure has led to a lot more volatility,” blaming it in part on “high-frequency traders.”\\n Also interesting was that Treasury Secretary Mnuchin essentially dismissed the significance of a flattening yield curve, saying that, “I don’t necessarily believe that the yield curve at this time is an adequate predictor of future economic issues.” When asked how much he looked at the yield curve as a reliable signal of the economy, Mnuchin replied by saying, “Not at all. Not at all.”  Even more interesting, Mnuchin said that, “I’m a big believer in general that markets are not always efficient,” adding that he looks at a variety of market information, including federal funds futures, the stock market and oil prices. Mnuchin was diplomatic, refusing to address the Fed, but his boss, President Trump urged the Fed to “feel the market’’ and avoid “yet another mistake” by raising rates. Lastly, Treasury Secretary Mnuchin added that China and the U.S. have had several rounds of talks in the past few weeks. Formal face-to-face meetings are now being scheduled in January, which gave the stock market hope that the Chinese trade spat may finally be resolved in the upcoming months. Mnuchin said that “We’re in the process of confirming the logistics of several meetings, and we’re determined to make sure that we use the time wisely, to try to resolve this” adding that both sides are now focused on trying “to document an agreement” by the March 1 deadline for their current tariffs truce to run out. Clearly, Treasury Secretary Mnuchin went on Bloomberg to try to calm financial markets last Tuesday. Most Economic Indicators Point Toward Fed Restraint (If They’re Listening) \\n\\n On Wednesday, the National Association of Realtors announced that existing home sales rose 1.9% in November to a 5.32 million annual pace compared to October. In the past 12 months, however, existing home sales have declined 7%, so a lot more improvement is needed before affordability issues can be resolved. In the Northeast, Midwest and South existing home sales surged 7.2%, 5.5% and 2.3%, respectively, but in the West, existing home sales declined 6.3% as that previously hot market cooled.\\n The Commerce Department announced Friday that durable goods orders rose 0.8% in November, after a sharp 4.3% plunge in October. A 67% surged in commercial jets and a 31.5% surge for military aircraft caused transportation orders to surge in November. Auto sales declined 0.2% in November and was the only weak transportation component. Excluding transportation, durable goods declined 0.3%. Core capital goods (excluding defense) declined 0.6%, while shipments declined 0.1%. In the first 11 months of 2018, durable goods have risen an impressive 8.4%, but the deceleration in the past couple of months is obvious, especially as autos and housing sales remain lackluster due to higher financing costs. I should also add that on Friday the Commerce Department revised down the third quarter GDP growth to 3.4% (annual rate) in the third quarter, down slightly from the 3.5% previously estimated. The Atlanta Fed on Tuesday revised down its fourth quarter GDP estimate to 2.9%, down from 3% previously estimated, so it is apparent that GDP growth is slowing as higher interest rates impact key industries. Finally, energy prices were sliding in tandem last week as both natural gas and crude oil prices have fallen due to weak seasonal demand. Natural gas is very weather-dependent and could spike when the next cold front envelops the Midwest and Northeast. Gasoline inventories naturally build in the winter months due to a lack of demand, but crude oil record production from Russia, Saudi Arabia and the U.S. continue to weigh on many energy stocks. Ironically, energy stocks are forecasted to have the strongest earnings announcement in January and February, so their guidance moving forward will likely be closely scrutinized. Overall, falling energy prices are further evidence that deflationary forces are widespread, and that inflation has fizzled. Longer-term, this lack of inflation should help put pressure on the Fed to stop raising key interest rates, but I’m frankly getting tired of saying that, since they aren’t listening.\\n The good news is that all (1, 2, 3, 5, 7 and 10-year) Treasury yields meandered significantly lower last week, which I thought would make the Fed “rethink” the long-term course of their interest rates policy. In fact, the 10-year Treasury bond yield hit a 4-month low below 2.8%, which is a good sign that market interest rates remain soft as inflation has fizzled. The Treasury yield curve is now the flattest it has been in 11 years, as a strong U.S. dollar continues to attract foreign capital, pushing Treasury yields lower. In summary, as I said in my Thursday podcast, the stock market could be up 10% or more in short order in some future week, but we first need a “spark.” Frankly, I thought that Wednesday’s FOMC statement would be that spark, but the Fed did not have the dovish statement that I anticipated. President Trump is furious with the Fed. In fact, Bloomberg reported on Friday that the President would like to fire Fed Chair Jerome Powell, but knows he can’t. Also on Friday, CNBC interviewed UBS’s Art Cashin, where he said that the Fed may not raise key interest rates in 2019 at all and added that there is an outside chance that the Fed might have to cut rates. Frankly, we need more bullish comments from seasoned market veterans like Art (and Warren Buffett, and others) to inspire confidence and spark this next “market melt-up.”  Let’s hope that spark happens right after Christmas! I hope you had a wonderful Christmas and can look forward to a Happy New Year! Disclosure: *Navellier may hold securities in one or more investment strategies offered to its clients.

There have been so many REITs that have been called SWANs that the term might as well mean: Here is a REIT I think is decent.  There are few if any investors who made it through the week without seeing a lot of red in their portfolio. While they can be extremely painful in the near-term, bear markets often provide opportunities for long-term investors to buy very high-quality stocks at prices that are rarely seen.  To me, the idea of a SWAN stock is an investment where I do not have to worry how much or how long it is in the red because the underlying company is so solid that no matter how bad the damage is, it will rebound when the storm is over.  For REITs, these are the companies that are very likely to maintain, or even grow, their dividend through even the worst downturns. They are companies that will be able to access credit, even when lenders tighten up. They are companies that will not be forced to sell properties if property values decline. They have enough organic cash-flow that they do not need to expand and can hunker down until the time is right to start buying up properties at low prices.  In a recent article, I listed 5 REITs that I consider to have SWAN status. Essex Property Trust (ESS), Realty Income (O), American Tower Corporation (AMT), Public Storage (PSA) and Prologis (PLD). Regular readers of mine will notice that I rarely write about these tickers. That is because there is rarely anything interesting to say about them. All 5 of these companies just keep doing what made them great. They are the kind of investments that you can buy and forget because there is unlikely to be some huge surprise. The very factors that make them boring to write about are the same ones that make them excellent investments to hold through and buy during bear markets. Looking at my article history, I realize I might have been remiss in ignoring these companies. It makes it look like my investing is far more aggressive than it actually is since I tend to write about the riskiest tickers I invest in.\\n ESS ESS is a multi-family REIT that invests in apartment complexes in the West Coast. \\n\\nSource They focus on metro areas which have high barriers to new housing construction as well as inherently strong demand. These fundamentals have allowed ESS to experience strong same-property NOI growth. \\n\\nSource: Q4 YoY NOI growth from quarterly supplementals While there is no escaping the real estate cycle, the strength of ESS is that they invest in areas where people want to live and there are significant physical as well as political barriers to new supply. Even through recessions, these areas have proven that they will bounce back. Balance Sheet REITs are designed to distribute the majority of their cash-flow to shareholders through dividends. The result is that issuing equity to raise capital for acquisitions is a frequent occurrence. Ideally, an equity issuance will raise enough capital that the new investments will not only cover the dividend for the new shares but will also increase per-share FFO for legacy shareholders.  When share prices fall, issuing new shares can become dilutive, meaning that the funds from shares issued cannot be invested to return enough cash-flow and legacy shareholders will see their FFO per share decline.  During a recession, one of the most common reasons that a REIT will issue shares even when it is dilutive to current shareholders is the need to deleverage or to pay off maturing debt. In a bull market, utilizing high levels of leverage can improve performance. When the market turns bearish, high leverage can spell disaster by forcing the REIT to issue equity when conditions are poor. \\n \\n\\n Source ESS maintains a modest leverage level of 5.5x Adjusted EBITDAre and as you can see, they have a healthy cushion on all of their covenants.  \\n\\nSource Looking at their maturity schedule, ESS does not have any significant lumps. They have a consistent $400-$700 million maturing per year and a $1.2 billion revolver that is currently undrawn. With a significant portion of their debt unsecured, ESS has significant flexibility to refinance even if the credit markets start to tighten up. Additionally, ESS maintains a series of more liquid investments which could be sold with no impact on their core operations.  \\n\\nSource   ESS is well positioned to weather a downturn.  FFO/Dividend Growth \\n\\nOne of the big attractions of REITs for retail investors is their dividends. I would argue one of the most important aspects for SWAN status is the ability and willingness to continue paying the dividend. From 2008-2010, many REITs cut their dividends as their FFO dropped. ESS beat that trend, and actually raised their dividend through the recession. \\n Like other REITs, ESS experienced a drop in FFO, per share FFO fell more than 20% from 2009 to 2010. Unlike most REITs, ESS was able to continue raising their dividend. While the 2010 increase was only a penny, even a very small raise provides reassurance in a recession.  Today, the payout ratio is lower than it has been in the last 18 years. If there is a recession in 2019, ESS has a very good chance of repeating what they have done in the last two recessions by raising the dividend a smaller amount with the payout ratio creeping higher but remaining manageable. Share Price \\n\\nESS data by YChartsWhile ESS managed to grow their dividend despite the recession, investors should realize that the share price was not so fortunate. Investors who were holding in 2008 saw their value drop 60% by early 2009. It took almost 3 years until mid-2011 for the share price to fully recover.  \\n\\nESS data by YChartsThe recession in the early 2000s was less severe for ESS, with a drawdown of only 20%, and recovery in approximately 2 years.  It is important for investors to realize that a \"SWAN\" is not immune to the ups and downs of the economy or the market. Investors can still experience large unrealized capital losses, and if you have a personal situation where you have to sell, those losses could become realized.  What makes a SWAN is a company where the investor does not have to worry about daily price action, secure in the belief that the company will continue to pay the dividend, will continue to have strong fundamentals and that the share price will recover. For investors who have cash, investing during the depths of a recession, when many are fleeing, can lead to outstanding returns.\\n Conclusion I consider ESS a SWAN because they invest in a sector and geographical locations which have very strong demand and limitations on supply. While those dynamics might be temporarily skewed out of favor, demand for residential housing on the West Coast is going to continue to grow long-term. The area remains very attractive not only on an economic level but is also geographically attractive. Coastal California is going to remain on the short-list of places where people dream of living. While on the supply side, it is very likely that the barriers to new construction are going to remain and continue to strengthen. Over the long-term, ESS should continue to experience supply-demand dynamics that are very favorable to landlords.  In terms of their balance sheet, ESS has a conservative leverage level and a debt maturity schedule that provides them with a lot of flexibility. In the event of a recession, ESS can partially pay off debt, refinance, add collateral or sell off unencumbered properties for cash depending on what is best for the conditions.  Historically, ESS has raised their dividend every single year since IPO. Even during the 2008-2010 recession, which was a recession driven by real-estate, ESS continued raising their dividend. With the FFO payout ratio at multi-decade lows, ESS remains in a position where they should be able to maintain that track record.  Investors have to be prepared for the possibility that the share-price could experience a significant drawdown. However, there is a very good chance they can maintain their dividend and control the decline of their FFO.  Since ESS was in a strong position before the 2009 recession, they were able to take advantage of the situation by doing things like redeeming their Series G preferred at a nearly $50 million discount. They were also able to resume acquisitions in 2010, near the bottom of the market. Those moves provided significant long-term value to shareholders. There is no safe harbor in a bear market, but there are those companies that manage their fundamentals and remain solid investments. When they become the baby being thrown out with the bathwater, investors can buy premium companies at heavily discounted prices.\\n Today, ESS is only about 10% off their high and I am not a buyer. If the bear market returns with a vengeance in 2019 and pushes prices down 20%-30%+, ESS is on my short list for flight to safety REITs. Disclosure: I am/we are long O, PLD, AMT.

Needless to say, the economic environment today is very different than the time of the Great Depression, so the parallels are difficult to draw, despite the similarity of the stock market performance. Based on the latest consensus estimates from Factset, EPS growth for the S&P 500 is going to be 20.6% in 2018 with another 7.9% in 2019, along with 5.3% revenue growth to boot. If the S&P 500 ends 2019 where it is today, that would mean that share prices would have failed to respond to a compounded EPS growth rate of over 30% in two years (1.206 x 1.079 = 1.301). If the economy is still growing in the second half of 2019, this will become the longest economic expansion in the history of the United States. I think it will continue for all of 2019. This means that, with a growing economy and growing earnings, this latest selloff is unlikely to be the start of a bear market. My 2018 annual prediction – that the U.S. dollar would rally in 2018 – has worked out well, despite a very poor performance in the first quarter (for my full prediction, see December 18, 2017 Marketwatch article “Ivan Martchev’s 2018 predictions: Gold will sink, and the dollar will rally”). It needs to be noted that the dollar is up a lot more against emerging markets currencies than the old U.S. Dollar Index, which contains only developed market currencies. This more notable outperformance against emerging markets currencies for the dollar is likely to persist in 2019. Recessions do not start with unemployment at a 49-year low of 3.7% (charted, below) and the economy growing at around 3%. Before a recession can start, the economy needs to slow, and the unemployment rate needs to stop falling and begin turning higher because of the economic slowdown. That takes time. \\n\\n\\n Graphs are for illustrative and discussion purposes only. Please read important disclosures at the end of this commentary. While a slowdown is likely to begin in 2019, the recession will most likely happen in 2020 or 2021. Can the Stock Market Go Down in a Good Economy? Yes, a stock market can go down in a good economy, as it is has been doing recently. For a protracted bear market, we need to see a shrinkage in earnings per share for the S&P 500 Index. The more the EPS for the Index shrinks, the more the index goes down. This happened in the recessions of 2001 and 2008 In the year 2000, the stock market was overvalued but it took a while for the air to come out of the bubble before it bottomed in March 2003. In the year 2007, the financial system almost blew up with unregulated mortgage lending and repackaging of no-documentation loans into fascinating securities with oxymoronic names for AAA-rated sub-prime CDOs. The 1929 and 2008 declines were most similar, as they had to do with financial system leverage and cascading losses as the leverage was unwinding. Unfortunately, there were also serious mistakes on the fiscal side (tariffs that caused a collapse in global trade) and monetary front (tightening that caused banks to fail) in the 1930s. The 1974 decline was due to a big oil price shock. While there is monetary tightening at present, it is not being done in a weak economy. And where tariffs are concerned, they are, so far, being used as a negotiating tactic. The Trump administration would argue that there has been progress on the trade front with Canada, Mexico, South Korea and even with the European Union, so this does not seem to be a full-blown global trade war, at least for now. The most extreme example of the stock market going down in a good economy would be 1987. \\n\\nThe 1987 market was the new Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan’s trial by fire, where he felt compelled to jump in with a few interest rate cuts, the same way he cut interest rates after the market sold off 25% in August and September of 1998 at the tail end of the Asian Crisis and the Russian sovereign debt default. Regrettably, the fortitude displayed by the famous Time magazine cover (below), dubbed “The Committee To Save The World,” is hopelessly missing at this very moment.\\n \\n\\n I think the present volatility of the stock market is not due to the hiking of the fed funds rate alone, but also to the more disruptive overall quantitative tightening, which demonstrates itself via the rising Fed balance sheet runoff rate, which went from $20 billion in January to the present $50 billion/month rate. \\n\\nLetting bonds mature (and not reinvesting the proceeds) also results in large repurchase agreement activity, which sucks excess reserves out of the financial system. Sucking electronic cash out of the financial system may be the simplest possible explanation as to why the stock market is doing what it is doing. (Enterprising minds are urged to carefully read the paper “The Federal Reserve’s Balance Sheet and Earnings: A Primer and Projections” by Fed economists Seth Carpenter, Jane Ihrig, Elizabeth Klee, Daniel Quinn, and Alexander Boote. There are other similar papers available from the Federal Reserve.) \\n\\n In my experience, sharp selloffs in a good economy tend to reverse themselves as the economy keeps growing and so does the earnings-per-share (EPS) for major stock market indexes like the S&P 500. Some of those “good economy” sharp selloffs – as in 1987 and 1997 – required active government intervention in order to stabilize the market, while others took care of themselves.\\n Still, in the present uncharted territory of quantitative tightening, I would have felt a lot better if Gary Cohn were the Fed Chairman. He ran a large investment management organization (Goldman Sachs Asset Management) and had extensive experience as a trader before becoming an executive and a CEO-in-waiting. One certainly needs a lot of theoretical experience to be a successful Fed Chairman, like Ben Bernanke proved, but in the situation that we have now, practical experience would also count for a lot.

Overview Back in the 1990\\'s and early 2000\\'s shipping experienced a boom when China began a massive and coordinated economic shift. This led to demand for energy and raw materials. The shift also produced a massive manufacturing base which began catering to the global merchandise demand. Consequently, demand for dry bulk, tankers, and containerships saw an uptick. But China has been slowing down amid another coordinated shift. GDP growth has been dropping since peaking in 2007 at 14.23%, according to the World Bank, with 2017 seeing 6.9% growth. In the third quarter from a year earlier China’s economy grew at a slower than expected pace of 6.5 percent, marking the weakest rate since the global financial crisis. Meanwhile, growth in India is firming up and projected to accelerate to 7.3% in the 2018-19 fiscal and 7.5% in the next two years. \\n\\nSource: World Bank Side note: India uses FY instead of calendar, which runs from April 1st to March 31st. Currently we are in FY 2019, otherwise stated as FY 2018-2019. Though China’s $12.2 trillion economy is five times larger, India is now poised to be the world\\'s fastest growing major economy. As a result, Indian demand for key products has been growing. Iron Ore Even though iron ore is abundantly available in India imports are on the rise. Iron ore imports into the country skyrocketed 190% to 6.34 million tons during April-August, the first five months of this financial year.\\n Until recently, India had been a net exporter of iron ore, but several factors are playing into a trend of India increasingly tapping global markets for supply. Increasing steel production has played into greater demand for iron ore. \\n\\nSource: Trading Economics India’s steel production in 2017 stood at 101.4 MT. Crude steel production has been growing at a CAGR of 5.49% over the last 6 years. India’s steel output is expected to grow at a CAGR of 8.9 per cent during 2017-21. Plans to achieve 300 mt by 2031 are firmly outlined. This increase in production and consequently iron ore demand comes at a time when challenges over recovering domestic supply remain. In 2011 the Supreme Court began clamping down on illegal mining. Operations were suspended in key production regions and output has only just recovered to levels seen before this Government intervention. Perhaps more importantly is that levels of FDI have dropped off as well. A recent report by the Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy pointed out that foreign direct investment inflows had slowed down significantly, from US $659 million in 2014-15 to about $36 million at the end of 2017-18. Mining’s overall contribution to FDI had declined from 2.06% to 0.08% in the same period. This lack of investment means that there are limitations on the availability of higher grade ore from domestic mines as they get older and the quantity of fines extracted is higher. Usually, steel plants are averse to lifting lower grade fines — higher grade ore is more suitable for their operations. Mining Weekly confirms that Indian steel producers are not technically equipped to feed their blast furnaces with low grade fines. The increased production of Indian iron ore has led to increasing stockpiles of low grade fines and regions like Jharkhand and Odisha reported there were no international buyers for the last several months. International buyers led by the Chinese are either booking high grade lumps or concentrates with virtually no takers for low grade Indian fines.\\n Only 18.9% of India\\'s reserves are shown to be high grade. The shift for higher quality iron ore in China can be traced to a growing concern over air pollution. Something India may want to consider as it now holds the top spot. Aside from preferences, large scale and efficient operations overseas mean that importing, for the most part, is the cheaper option compared to buying from the domestic market. Indian steel mills are also reporting challenges securing domestic iron ore that is suitable. Miners are not getting enough railway rakes, as these are diverted to the coal sector. Furthermore, freight and passenger trains in Asia’s third-largest economy jostle for space on the same tracks, and goods carriers often have to make way for passenger traffic, prolonging turnaround time for wagons hauling commodities. Therefore, a fast growing steel industry is likely to be supplied by an increasing amount of overseas iron ore as domestic quality, output, logistics, prices, and availability all appear to play into this shift. If imports stay on track, 2019 will likely be one of the strongest years for iron ore imports in several. \\n\\nSource: Bloomberg Major producers see this as a potential long term trend in the making and Australia’s government expects annual imports to rise to 19 million tons by 2020. Coal With a decade-low stockpile at Coal India\\'s mines and more than half of the plants at \"supercritical\" level of less than seven days\\' stock, the reliance on imported coal for several power plants will increase the flow of imports into India. This is quite a turn for a country which in 2017 saw the head of the coal ministry, Piyush Goyal, proclaim that “We don’t wish to import coal from anywhere in the world. We have sufficient coal capacity in our country.”\\n This could be due to the fact that state-owned Coal India continues to struggle to step up coal production and has fallen well short of previous targets. Or it could be that coal fired electricity, which fuels approximately 75% of India\\'s domestic energy needs, is finding it difficult to keep up with recent robust industrial production. Industrial production in India has grown at an average of more than 7% this year, which has led to an increase in power generation by 6% over January to August 2018. Wood Mackenzie\\'s coal principal analyst Pralabh Bhargava reported: Growth in domestic coal production and dispatches can only partially meet the growing demand for coal, which is resulting in increased reliance on imports. While India has indeed been increasing its own domestic output the gains are not enough to keep up with the robust demand. A key supplier of coal to India has become the USA. According to the EIA, shipments of US coal to India over the first half of 2018 are 136.6% higher than the same time last year. The USA now supplies roughly 8% of India\\'s imported coal. Even though this report is about India, I can\\'t help but share this chart showing key coal consumers relying more on US produced coal, which represents a long haul voyage for dry bulk vessels. \\n\\nSource: Forbes Since we\\'re on the subject of voyage lengths a subtle shift has been taking place beyond the US gaining market share. That of increasing imports from South Africa. The shift could be attributed to the fact that a large part of India’s coal imports are used by consumers other than on-grid power plants. A significant portion of coal-fired generation capacity is used by captive power users. These users include aluminium smelters, cement makers and other industries. Given these consumers have to run their captive power plants in order to produce their goods, this demand isn\\'t very price sensitive. It makes sense for captive-power plant buyers in India to seek higher quality coal as it maximizes the output from their plants.\\n This could explain why South African and US coal have been gaining favor. \\n\\nSource: Reuters India\\'s domestic coal reserves face a similar challenge as that of iron ore. By and large, India’s coal is of poorer quality and has a lower gross calorific value. Additionally, domestic demand growth for the commodity is like to outpace domestic supply growth paving the way for increasing imports. Domestic output is likely to remain stagnant at 2.5%-3.5% according to the Times of India. Furthermore, they stated that \"improved capacity utilisation in power, cement and steel sectors will be major drivers of coal import.\" Pralabh Bhargava echoed that sentiment: Growth in domestic coal production and dispatches can only partially meet the growing demand for coal, which is resulting in increased reliance on imports. With the power sector increasingly relying on imports, we expect the rally in Indian imports to continue till early next year. This goes a long way in explaining why India\\'s thermal coal imports rose at the fastest pace in three-and-a-half years, up 35% to 42.7 million tonnes during the three months ended Sept. 30. With BP projecting that Indian demand for coal will see the biggest growth among all energy segments, expanding by 132% through 2014, the import story may just be getting started.  Crude Oil Indian crude oil production has been on a long term downward trend for several years. \\n\\nSource: Trading Economics\\n Meanwhile, demand for crude is growing at an impressive clip. India imports around 82.8% of the oil it consumes. The BP Energy Outlook projects that it will see its energy consumption growing at the fastest rate among all major economies by 2040. Oil imports will rise by 175%, BP says, estimating India’s oil consumption at 10 million bpd in 2040. OPEC\\'s latest report echoes those findings. According to the 2018 World Oil Outlook, India will see the largest additional demand of any nation at 5.8 million bpd, likely passing the 10 million bpd mark sometime towards the end of 2040. These are some very healthy growth estimates for a country that recently overtook Japan to become the world\\'s third-biggest crude oil importing nation after China and the US. Increasing crude imports are almost guaranteed as India has embarked on a massive build-out of their refining capacity. The Business Standard reports that the current refining capacity of 247.6 mtpa in India is projected to increase to 259 mtpa by 2020 and further to about 439 mtpa by 2030. Over that period, demand is seen to be 220 million tons, 271 million tons and 335 million tons, respectively. These figures indicate that India still has ambitions to maintain a 25% product export rate in the long run. Gibson Shipbrokers spelled out a similar story: Looking further ahead, irrespective of prices, developments in Indian refining capacity are likely to be the main driving force behind the growth in crude import demand. Between 2019-2022, 550,000 b/d of additional refining capacity is due to come online, roughly the same as demand growth projections over the corresponding period. Even if domestic demand does falter, high run rates are likely to keep import volumes high. If unexpectedly the domestic market cannot absorb all the product, then refined product export volumes will have to rise. LNG & LPG As the fourth largest importer of LNG, India has a profound impact on the market. Though the 19.22 MT purchased in 2017 was only 1.3% above the previous year, import volumes in 2018 are once again growing strongly.\\n LNG World Shipping reports: Imports for April-July 2018 reached 7.46M tonnes, a 20.3% jump on the same period a year earlier. Utilisation rates at Dahej, the largest of the country’s four import terminals with a capacity of 15M tonnes per annum of LNG, have been running at over 100% throughout this year. That utilization rate would seem to put a damper on future growth, however, India’s four receiving terminals will soon be joined by at least half a dozen new import terminals over the next few years, three of which are set to be operational before the end of 2018. This additional capacity represents about 98.05 mmtpa, which would allow the nation to reach a total LNG import capacity of 128.05 mmtpa. Meaning India will be able to import roughly 226% more LNG in the very near future. It\\'s also noteworthy that there are several more import terminals in the planning stage. India is pushing to more than double the share of natural gas in its energy mix to 15 percent by 2022. Even as the country is moving towards becoming a gas-driven economy, domestic production has been on a consistent decline over the past five years, falling another 1.43% in September. \\n\\nSource Though India aspires to increase domestic production of oil and gas (doubling gas output by 2022) by recently announcing that foreign investors will have opportunities to invest in projects worth $300 billion, that might be a tall order to attract that level of investment. According to data released by the Department of Industrial Policy and Promotion, the petroleum and natural gas sector attracted FDI worth $7 billion between April 2000 and June 2018. Even if India does manage to double its output it would only bring them slightly above 2010 levels. Demand has grown significantly since then and is still projected to outpace any supply gains keeping LNG imports growing.\\n Conclusion Imports to India went up 10.5% year-on-year to $41.9 billion in September of 2018. \\n\\nSource: Trading Economics They were boosted by purchases of gold (51.5%), petroleum and crude (33.6%), coal, coke and briquettes (23.6%), and electronic goods (11.4%). BP projects that oil imports will rise by 175% and account for 65% of the increase in energy imports, followed by a 291% gain for gas and 79% for coal through 2040. With steel capacity set to rise and limited high quality reserves which will become more sought after going forward, iron ore imports should also see increases. India appears to be on a solid growth trajectory. However, as they experience that growth imports will become a larger part of the picture as domestic production in key areas concerning shipping fails to keep pace. This looks to benefit gas carriers, dry bulk, and crude tankers. If India can achieve their goal of refinery production beyond domestic demand those volumes should also add to product tanker demand as well. Just a few years ago, the contribution by India to global maritime demand was looking a bit weak. However, recent developments appear to have strengthened their potential contribution to seaborne trade.

The company's long-term outlook seems to be positive, as its expanding brand will most likely make its way into China and Asia once the tension has settled. Furthermore, the company's current share price is not justified by its current financials, meaning that there has been an overreaction to the news in China. Company Overview Canada Goose Holdings is a Canada-based company that designs, manufactures, and sells outerwear for men, women, and children. It operates through both wholesale and direct to consumer. This premium company has developed a brand that has grown its luxury presence over the globe. Basic Financials   Current Price $42.64   52-Week Range $28.41 - 72.27   P/E Ratio 62.43   (Source: Yahoo Finance) Market Overview The market for outerwear is diverse and disjointed, as a few companies often have brand presence. Canada Goose specifically competes with wholesalers and direct retailers of luxury outerwear and apparel. Specifically, its key competitors are Moncler in Europe and Patagonia in the USA, both of which have significant brand exposure in certain parts of the USA. Catalysts Canada Goose's stock decline seems to have stemmed from the social media campaign to boycott the company after Canada's arrest of the Huawei CFO. This came right before the opening of Canada Goose's flagship store, which has now been delayed. Due to its presence and reputation as a top Canadian label, it took the brunt of the damage, but this seems to be a short-term effect.\\n Canada Goose should still be able to expand into China and Asia. The company has demonstrated significant earnings and revenue growth, and this is a large part of the brand's expanding presence. As the company continues to grow, it will break out of the temporary slump. Canada Goose also recently announced that it will be extending its products to include both fall and spring apparel. Although known for its winter parkas, the company will be able to bring consumers in all year round. Company Valuation A Discounted Cash Flow valuation was used with the Growth in Perpetuity Approach. The following assumptions were used:  A constant effective tax rate of 23%. Projections were done based on a percentage of revenues.  ** Values in millions        GOOS Unlevered Free Cash Flows         Period (t) 2017A 2018P 2019P 2020P 2021P 2022P            EBITDA 160 230 234 337 489 705   EBIT 151 216 214 308 447 644   Tax Rate 23% 23% 23% 23% 23% 23%   EBIT (1-t) 151 167 165 238 346 498   D&A 9 14 20 29 42 61   Increase in NWC (69) (73) (133) (78) (255) (128)   Capital Expenditures 0 0 0 (4) (15) (16)   Unlevered Free Cash Flows (UFCF) 92 108 52 186 118 415            Discount Rate (r)  10% 10% 10% 10% 10%   PV of UFCFs  98 43 140 80 258             Stage 1: Sum of Present Values 620                Terminal value - Growth in Perpetuity Approach    Long-Term Growth Rate 7%   2022 FCF x (1+g) 366   Terminal Value in 2022 12,216    Stage 2: PV of TV 7,585   Enterprise Value (Stage 1 + 2) 8,263         Perpetuity Approach   Equity value $74.74    (Source: 10-K) This results in an equity value or share price of $74.74, much closer to what the company was trading at before the news regarding Huawei. Discussion This year, the company has already opened multiple retail locations all around the globe. Furthermore, each of its new stores has seen over 35% revenue growth, which I believe will continue for at least another year as the brand will continue opening new retail locations. As the company opens more stores in locations around the world, revenue will consistently grow due to its reputation as a luxury brand. Canada Goose reported in its Investor Presentation that more than 80% of owners have positive feelings about the brand and will consider purchasing more apparel from the company. Thus, it has established itself as a top luxury, outerwear retailer that will continue to see sales growth.\\n It has also begun increasing its online presence through the use of DTC E-Commerce, which removes any borders regarding who can purchase Canada Goose. Furthermore, Canada Goose has created a network of retail partners, which will continue to grow as the company expands. \\n\\n (Source: Canada Goose Investor Presentation) Risks and Mitigants The biggest upfront risk is the tension between China and Canada right now. As political tensions increase between not only Canada and China but also USA and China, there will be some impact on the ability for the company to spread overseas. However, I believe this tension will eventually relieve itself or, at the bare minimum, exclude the luxury retailer, as the brand has shown popularity with individuals all around the world. Thus, those seeking to purchase the luxury outerwear will be able to purchase online, eventually moving over to DTC methods once the retail locations open. There is also the presence of other luxury outerwear companies such as Moncler, but Canada Goose has continued to demonstrate its brand purchase. As mentioned above, those who purchase the company's products are likely to purchase them once again. This shows the ability for an established brand like Canada Goose to retain its customers over time. Conclusion Canada Goose has been undervalued as a result of the Canada-Huawei incident, and the company's true financials value it a lot higher than the $40 that it's trading at now. Coupled with the established and growing brand, this will allow Canada Goose to continue expanding overseas, leading to an increased presence internationally.\\nDisclosure: I/we have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

Source: RV Share Last week, Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell hiked rates and suggested more were on the horizon. The angst surrounding financial markets would lead one to believe a falling stock market could be a predictor of an economic slowdown. RV shipments could be an even more accurate predictor. A decline in RV shipments preceded the last two recessions. That said, we may already be in the throes of recession. RV shipments for November 2018 were 33,023, down 21% Y/Y. Towable RVs fell 21%, while motorhomes were down 17%. Through year-to-date November 2018 shipments were 444,090, down 3% Y/Y.\\n\\n In the first half of 2018, RV manufacturers could not ship units fast enough. Dealers did not want to miss out on sales, so shipments may have exceeded consumer demand. Thousands of RVs remain on dealer lots awaiting buyers. A slowdown in shipments could be a necessary evil in order to work down excess inventory. In its most recent quarter, Winnebago (WGO) reported double-digit revenue growth and management indicated it was taking market share from competitors. The company\\'s dealer inventory exceeded 21,000 units, representing a 30% increase Y/Y and 8% sequentially. Winnebago could be stuffing the sales channel to devour whatever is left of the industry\\'s remaining demand. Its dealer inventory represents over 55% of total RV shipments for the month of December 2017. That implies shipments for December 2018 could also free fall as the industry continues to work through inventory balances.\\n The average cost for RVs can range from $30,000 for towables to as much as $100,000 for motorhomes. It may be only a matter of time before declining shipments create ripples through the economy. They could negatively impact RV parts suppliers like LCI Industries (LCII) and Patrick Industries (PATK). The hit to labor and the decline in orders of aluminum, steel and other parts and supplies cannot be good for the economy. RVs represent discretionary items that are typically the first to get cut when households feel a pinch. The question remains, \"What other discretionary items will be cut out?\" Luxury goods, apparel, entertainment, leisure activities and automobiles could get hit next. Unemployment Rises In Elkhart Indiana Elkhart, IN is known as the \"RV Capital of the World\" as the lion\\'s share of RVs sold in the U.S. come from Elkhart and the surrounding area. Elkhart has about 55,000 residents and unemployment in the region could be the canary in the coalmine. Falling RV shipments oftentimes lead to rising unemployment in Elkhart. \\n\\nOctober 2018 unemployment for Elkhart was 2.9%, up from 2.2% in the year earlier period. Unemployment for the U.S. was 3.5%, down from 3.9% in the year earlier period. Falling shipments have forced some RV manufacturers to reduce the work week for employees. The spike in unemployment also does not fit the narrative that falling shipments will dissipate as heightened inventory is worked down. It likely implies manufacturers expect shipments to continue to fall. That\\'s not good for Elkhart or the U.S. economy. Conclusion We are likely in the throes of recession. Cyclical names and companies with high debt loads could fall hard over the next few quarters. That includes RV-related names like LCII and WGO and PATK.\\n Disclosure: I am/we are short WGO, LCII, PATK. I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions.

We are suffering through the sixth correction of 10% or more in the nearly-10-year history of this bull market. The last correction of this magnitude struck in January-February, 2016. The cause of that correction (as this) was fear of a global slowdown. Some of the headlines of that time were:   “World Bank Downgrades Global Growth in 2016” (UN News, January 5, 2016)  “5 Reasons the IMF Says Global Economic Growth is Slowing” (NPR, April 12, 2016)  “These 9 Charts Explain the Global Economic Slowdown” (Forbes, May 6, 2016)  “World Economic Growth is Slowing” (The Economist, May 19, 2016)  “We’re in a Low-Growth World. How Did We Get Here?” (New York Times, August 6, 2016).  What happened next? The world never stopped growing. Suddenly, stories of a global growth slowdown were replaced by stories of “coordinated global growth” in 2017. Every nation among the top 50 covered by The Economist each week (except Venezuela) was growing, and the growth rate surged from 3.2% in 2016 to 3.7% in 2017. The chart below (published in early 2018) shows real numbers for 2012-16 and projected through 2022, showing 2016 to be a low-water mark for the decade and no real “slowdown.” \\n\\n With the magic of compound interest, if the world actually grows as fast as the IMF projected earlier this year, the global GDP would be 48% greater in real terms (adjusted for inflation) in 2023 than in 2012. But now, with renewed concerns for another “global growth slowdown” arising in late 2018, the IMF has lowered its forward projections for 2018 and 2019 growth from 3.94% to 3.7%, but that’s hardly a slowdown when compared to 2016 or even 2017. It’s the same fairly-rapid 3.7% annual growth rate.\\n A world growing 3.7% each year doubles its output every 19 years. Anyone want to complain about that? Look at the top-line growth rate for the whole world – Christmas past, Christmas present, and Christmas future. Only a Scrooge would look at those numbers and call consistent 3.7% growth a “slowdown.” \\n\\n The formerly poor countries of Asia continue to lead the pack. From this point of the view, the poorest of the world are getting richer faster than the richer nations are accumulating more wealth. In this way, the global “wealth gap” is being rapidly closed, even if it is not being closed in each specific rich nation.  Fastest Growth Rates in 2019  India  7.4%   China  6.2%   ASEAN-5  5.2% (Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore and Thailand)   Low-Income  5.2% (Formerly called “Developing Countries”)  Source: IMF, World Economic Outlook, October 2018  Meanwhile, the slowest growth rates are still positive, not negative, so there are no recessions, anywhere:  Slowest Growth rates in 2019  Japan  +0.9%   Italy  +1.0%   South Africa  +1.4%   U.K.  +1.5%   France  +1.6%  Source: IMF, World Economic Outlook, October 2018  There’s been a lot of talk about a Eurozone recession, but you’ll notice all those slow-growth numbers have a plus-sign preceding them – no recession in sight. Recently, ECB President Mario Draghi cut growth forecasts for the Eurozone by just 0.1% to 1.9% in 2018, down from 2.0% in September. Also, estimates for 2019 GDP growth were revised to 1.7% from 1.8%. That’s just a SINGLE TENTH lower. Is the Market Really Fearing a “Great Earnings Slowdown”? More likely than a GDP slump, the market may fear an earnings slowdown in 2019. That’s only natural after a year with a 23%+ projected earnings gain for the S&P 500, reflecting the first year of the corporate tax-rate reduction, but projected earnings growth rates for 2019 and 2020 are still 8%+ and 10%+. Ed Yardeni wrote last week that the 2019 earnings estimates are now +8.3%, and 2020 estimates are +10.4%.\\n \\n\\nYardeni adds that “the growth rate for Q4-2018 has been reduced from 18.2% at the end of September to 14.5% currently. That’s not unusual. They often do so only to find that the earnings season was better than their downwardly revised estimates.” Another overblown worry is the supposed decline in capital spending because businesses are “spending all their tax windfall on share buybacks.” Partly true, in that share buybacks may reach $1 trillion this year, but capital spending may reach $3 trillion and is growing just as fast. As Yardeni wrote last Tuesday (in “The True Story: Capital Spending at Record High”), “nominal capital spending rose to a record high of $2.8 trillion (saar) during Q3-2018. Over the past year through Q2-2018, S&P 500 buybacks totaled $646 billion. That’s a lot, but it wasn’t enough to slow capital spending.” He charted the two together: \\n\\nThe market is terribly worried about something – maybe Fed policy or the government closing down. Whatever it is, scared investors are creating the worst December since 1931 (so far), and the worst fourth quarter since at least 2008 (we’ll have the final post-mortem next week). Maybe we desperately need to worry about something, no matter how good the statistical realities look. Perhaps investors would rather be worried, but I believe that the vast bulk of the world will continue to work hard and keep growing.

However, unless it does so at an extraordinarily rapid rate, it seems hard to imagine the company achieving its hoped-for profitability in 2019, let alone justify its current valuation, as it will be reduced to a small, niche user market with monetization rates far below that of other Internet and social media service companies. Snap Is Winning A Battle But Still Losing The War Snap stock price has recently declined significantly as the broader equity markets have begun sinking since October. But the bulk of the decline came over the course of the summer, while domestic equity markets were still hot, as the company began posting user growth stagnation and decline. The stock now is down about 65% for the year. \\n\\nSNAP data by YCharts\\n Q1 2018 was Snapchat\\'s peak in terms of user growth, as it posted a historic high of 191 million daily active users. However, Q2 2018 saw DAU drop to 188 million with decreases in every reported region. The recent Q3 2018 report saw continued decline in this metric, as total DAU sank to 186 million, the North America and Europe regions saw further decreases, and \"Rest of World\" saw stagnation. \\n\\n (Source: Statista) \\n\\n (Source: Q3 2018 Snapchat Earnings Press Release) On the bright side, the company seems to have been able to increase revenues and average revenue per user quite significantly. Its losses have been stemmed too, to a milder but still significant degree. Nonetheless, despite that relative improvement compared to past quarters, Snap still lost $1.064 billion YTD on revenue of just $790 million. \\n\\n (Source: Q3 2018 Snapchat Earnings Press Release) Essentially, Snap faces the combination of slightly improving monetization and financials with a stagnant and declining user base. Because of this I believe the company remains a poor investment proposition in the long run because it simply has not been able to find, and likely can\\'t, a distinctive niche that allows it to be a serious competitor to rival platforms.\\n The fact is that the entire service Snapchat offers is essentially just another feature on Facebook (FB) and Instagram. Though, Facebook and Instagram benefit from being connected to a far larger ecosystem of services and activities that undoubtedly has been a big hurdle to Snapchat\\'s attempted growth. In looking over Snapchat\\'s recently touted Q3 2018 community engagement achievements, which range from some original content programming to some features that include shopping, it doesn\\'t seem like these have been able to stem the tide of declining user activity nor distinguish the platform enough. That remains the heart of the company\\'s problem at the moment. Snapchat\\'s core service is inherently an ephemeral activity rather than building a profile or network as with standard social media. Indeed, the company itself has said it is not social media, and studies and polls have shown Snapchat users hesitate to engage in serious concentrated activity on the platform, avoiding celebrities or in-depth activities, beyond the momentary \"Snaps\" the platform is seemingly about. These very low-engagement activities have proven difficult to monetize, and given all the ways and how hard the company has tried over the years, this likely will not see much improvement. One hope for user activity is that Snapchat appears to be extremely popular among teenagers in the United States. Though that does not necessarily secure its future in and of itself, as teenagers do not seem to be a high-money target market and may well age out of the platform once they do become more revenue-heavy users. The company has quite positive Q4 2018 guidance with between $355 million and $380 million in revenue and an expected EBITDA loss of only between $75 million and $100 million, all major year-on-year improvements. However, unless Snap not only finds a way to reverse its declining user base but actually grow, it seems unlikely to find long-term sustainability. As I\\'ve explained, I think that is a relatively impossible task due to how major other social media behemoths have essentially tailored in so well the company\\'s core product into their own systems in ways that make them much more attractive, putting a major blockade on Snapchat\\'s growth. Even Instagram\\'s \"Stories\" feature, not counting Facebook\\'s own \"Stories\" feature, sees double the daily use as the entirety of Snapchat back during Snapchat\\'s prime earlier this year.\\n Therefore, Snap, currently at about $6.7 billion in market capitalization, seems grossly overvalued for a company that may barely squeeze out some profits next year. If current growth trends continue on their most optimistic trajectory and the company, for example, achieves around $1.5 in revenue in 2019 and maybe $50-100 million in earnings, then based on 1.291 billion shares outstanding, that would mean EPS of $0.04-0.08. Based on Snap\\'s current stock price of $5.42, that\\'s a P/E ratio of between 67 and 135. While many high-growth social media companies can justify such a P/E ratio, Snap has been around since 2011 and does not seem likely to experience high growth based on the aforementioned user activity and competitor problems. If the company were to have a more normal mature Internet services P/E ratio of about 30, that means a stock price of between $1.2 to $2.4 a share. I am not totally sure it will hit those deep levels, as there will likely still be many Snapchat believers giving the stock a premium, but I still believe that means even if the company does go profitable next year, its total earnings haul may be either restrained or still take years to appreciate into its price. All that assumes it finds some still-unlikely way to compete against bigger competitors and reverse its user activity decline. Conclusion I believe that Snap\\'s improving financials are a major positive development for the company. But it doesn\\'t solve the company\\'s fundamental long-term issue of stagnant user activity growth or even inertia, as larger platforms like Facebook and Instagram have built essentially their own \"Snapchat\" into their social media services. The company may still keep on treading along, appealing to a niche market and perhaps increasing user monetization to a moderate degree, and may eventually even attain profitability. However, as I\\'ve explained, even under the best of circumstances, the company may still struggle to justify its current price from an earnings standpoint.\\n\\nDisclosure: I am/we are long FDN.

Liquefied natural gas technology is being utilized to commercialize those resources, as the sheer size of the Tortue gas field means those supplies need to gain access to hungry customers in Asia and Europe. For Kosmos Energy Limited, this development is its largest ever and marks the beginning of its journey to becoming a medium-sized upstream player in the offshore conventional world. For BP plc, this development is part of its ongoing strategy to shift its upstream production mix from a 50/50 split between oil & gas to one that is 40% oil and 60% gas by the 2020s. Let\\'s dig in. The discovery Kosmos Energy discovered the offshore Tortue gas field back in April 2015 through the Tortue 1 exploration well. Subsequent appraisal activity indicated the prospect was one large gas field. The discovery was rebranded as the Greater Tortue Ahmeyim complex, which consists of Tortue West, Tortue East, and Tortue North reservoirs. Kosmos Energy, as the operator of the exploration side of the venture, estimates the field houses at least 15 trillion cubic feet of recoverable natural gas resources. There is room for upside as the Greater Tortue Ahmeyim complex may house up to 50 Tcf of recoverable gas resources and an additional 1 billion barrels of recoverable liquids hydrocarbons (condensate and liquefied petroleum gas). Due to Kosmos Energy\\'s exploration success, BP bought into the play in late-2016 in a deal valued at almost $1 billion at the time. BP will be the operator of any development activities at the play, and Kosmos Energy will remain operator of the exploration activities.\\n After the deal, the ownership of the play is broken down as follows. In Senegal, BP owns 60% of the Saint Louis Offshore Profond and Cayar Offshore Profond Blocks. Kosmos Energy and Petrosen (Senegal\\'s state-run energy firm) own 30% and 10% of those blocks, respectively. In Mauritania, BP owns 62% of blocks C6, C8, C12, and C13. Kosmos Energy and SMHPM (Mauritania\\'s state-run energy firm) own 28% and 10% of those blocks, respectively. Combined, BP, Kosmos, Petrosen, and SMHPM own 61%, 29%, 5% and 5%, respectively, of the Tortue unit. Note that BP purchased a larger stake in this venture back in 2017 from a third-party no longer participating in the project. The Tortue gas field is located at the maritime border between these two West African nations, and in February 2018, both nations signed a cooperation agreement that ultimately enabled a final investment decision to be reached. BP, Kosmos Energy, and their government partners sanctioned Phase 1 of the Greater Tortue Ahmeyim LNG development in December 2018, and first-gas is expected by 2022. It isn\\'t clear how expensive the project will be yet, as procurement activities are required before obtaining a reasonable estimate. Overview of the project The first development phase seeks to commercialize the offshore Tortue gas field via an FPSO (floating production storage offloading) facility that is tied-back to a FLNG (floating liquefied natural gas) facility. Producing wells would be connected to the FPSO facility, which will separate natural gas (methane) from other hydrocarbons in the production stream (natural gas liquids and condensate). From there, the natural gas will be processed at the FPSO facility before being shipped off to the FLNG facility, where the gas will be cooled down to negative 260 degrees Fahrenheit. At that temperature, natural gas becomes a liquid product that takes up only 1/600th of the space of its gaseous form. LNG cargos will be exported from the FLNG facility, while condensate and LPG (butane and propane) will be exported from the FPSO facility. This project also envisions building onshore gas-fired electricity plants that will be connected to the Greater Tortue Field via subsea pipelines running to both Senegal and Mauritania. Gas distribution infrastructure in both West African nations will need to be built out as well as Senegal and Mauritania want to develop domestic industries around the Tortue development. In other words, to go beyond simply exporting LNG. While gas demand is relatively low in both nations, that may change over time. Regional demand growth for natural gas offers the venture modest long-term upside.\\n \\n\\n Source: BP plc BP and Kosmos Energy will be able to offer more concrete information on the development once \"project execution activities\" begin during the first quarter of 2019. For now, what is known is that the FLNG facility will have the capacity to produce 2.5 million metric tons of liquefied natural gas each year. That is equivalent to 335 million cubic feet of natural gas per day, making the first phase a relatively small endeavor. Initial productivity assessments from a drill stem test at the Tortue 1 well point towards the venture being able to bring production wells online that will produce up to 200 million cubic feet of gas per day. This is due to the equipment-constrained Tortue 1 well reaching a peak production rate of 60 MMcf/d, with the assumption being that if the proper infrastructure is in place, those wells would produce a lot more on a daily basis as minimal reservoir pressure reductions were seen during the drill stem test. That makes these wells on par with those seen at Trinidad & Tobago in the Caribbean (BP is a big player across Trinidad & Tobago\\'s entire natural gas industry), which are some of the most prolific gas wells in the world. Longer term, BP and Kosmos Energy plan to increase the Tortue development\\'s LNG production capacity up to 10 million metric tons per year, equivalent to over 1.3 Bcf/d of natural gas. The first phase is a greenfield development due to the nonexistent infrastructure in the region, but going forward, future brownfield developments will be able to take advantage of infrastructure (subsea pipelines, production handling infrastructure, onshore facilities) built out during the first development phase. Generally speaking, greenfield projects tend to have weaker returns than brownfield projects. Not to say that the first development phase won\\'t generate a nice return for BP and Kosmos Energy, but note that the real upside is the growth runway the Tortue field offers the venture.\\n BP Gas Marketing will purchase all of the LNG supplies from Phase 1 of the Greater Tortue Ahmeyim development. As an experienced LNG marketer, BP is well-equipped to find end buyers for the project\\'s production. Final thoughts Moving forward with this project validates the thesis that West Africa is one of the world\\'s leading exploration regions for oil & gas. While many analysts, including those at BNEF (Bloomberg New Energy Finance), expect a mild glut of LNG from 2020 to 2021, the Greater Tortue development won\\'t start exporting LNG until 2022 at the earliest. That means BP plc and Kosmos Energy Limited will be able to circumvent weak spot prices for LNG during that period, as the venture should come online at a time when global liquefied natural gas demand will begin to outstrip supply unless more LNG projects get sanctioned. This development is a perfect example of BP plc\\'s long-term strategy of becoming a gassier integrated energy major, and highlights how management is effective at extending the firm\\'s growth runway. For Kosmos Energy Limited, this is a key part of the firm\\'s transformation from an offshore exploration company to a serious producer of oil & gas resources. West Africa\\'s economic future is getting brighter, and the governments of Mauritania and Senegal are positioning their respective economies to take advantage of this massive gas discovery.

The recent assembly election results have reiterated this. We saw a leadership change at the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), with Mr. Shaktikanta Das\\'s appointment as the new RBI Governor, following Mr. Urjit Patel\\'s resignation. The financial markets have also had their fair share of ups and downs. In 2018, India\\'s equity market witnessed a low when the S&P BSE SENSEX dropped to 32,596 (price return index level as of March 23, 2018), but also saw a high of 38,896 (price return index level as of Aug. 28, 2018) - a fluctuation of 6,300 points and a 19% variation over the year. However, this year the index reached record highs compared with the past 10 years. The S&P BSE SENSEX first crossed the 10,000 mark on Dec. 18, 2008, the 20,000 mark on Sept. 21, 2010, and finally the 30,000 mark on April 26, 2017. The fixed income market was no exception, with the 10-year Government Bond yields crossing 8% multiple times in September and October 2018. There has a been an ongoing discussion on the broadening of the Indian debt market, which faces challenges in terms of liquidity, innovation, investor awareness, and participation.\\n\\n Other changes introduced by the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) were style and size definitions for mutual funds, as well as consolidation of mutual fund schemes to a single offering in each style category in order to create a standardization for the market and its investors. SEBI also advised mutual funds to adopt total return indices (TRI) to benchmark their schemes, effective as of Feb. 1, 2018. This would enable investors to compare the appropriate index with the scheme\\'s performance.\\n With the constantly shifting investment landscape, some changes have been significant. The endless discussion around the active vs. passive debate has also progressed. More and more market participants have aligned with the fact that a passive investment strategy can be part of the overall investment goal achievement. A core satellite strategy easily encompasses both active and passive styles. The SPIVA® India Mid-Year 2018 results revealed how large-cap funds in India have been underperforming the benchmark, the S&P BSE 100. The index outperformed the fund category by over 87% in the 1-year period, 78% in the 3-year period, 48% in the 5-year period, and 62% in the 10-year period. Active fund managers have been waking up to the fact that large-cap passive investing is a strategy potentially worth evaluating.  Exhibit 2: Percentage of Funds Outperformed by the Index  FUND CATEGORY COMPARISON INDEX 1-YEAR (%) 3-YEAR (%) 5-YEAR (%) 10-YEAR (%)   Indian Equity Large-Cap S&P BSE 100 87.88 78.35 48.08 62.77   Indian Equity-Linked Savings Scheme S&P BSE 200 83.72 61.54 27.78 43.33   Indian Equity Mid-/Small-Cap S&P BSE 400 MidSmallCap Index 62.22 78.26 53.03 50.67   Indian Government Bond S&P BSE India Government Bond Index 82.93 75.47 82.35 94.92   Indian Composite Bond S&P BSE India Bond Index 30.00 60.42 68.70 95.45   Source: S&P Dow Jones Indices LLC, Morningstar, and Association of Mutual Funds in India.

The S&P BSE 400 MidSmallCap Index was launched on Nov. 30, 2017. The S&P BSE India Government Bond Index was launched on Dec. 31, 2013. The S&P BSE India Bond Index was launched on March 12, 2014. Furthermore, government bodies like the Employee Provident Fund Organization (EPFO) and the Department of Investment and Public Asset Management (DIPAM) have supported the passive style of investing with the promotion of exchange-traded funds (ETFs). EPFO\\'s allocation to equity ETFs stood at 15% of its investible surplus, which is over INR 40,000 crores as of September 2018. Furthermore, the EPFO has been developing software that will allow it to credit the ETFs to subscriber accounts, thereby empowering subscribers for further transaction. DIPAM, on the other hand, used the ETF vehicle successively to liquidate holdings in public sector undertakings. In 2018, it had follow-on offers for the ETFs, the S&P BSE BHARAT 22 ETF and the CPSE ETF, both of which were oversubscribed. Its new initiative for a debt ETF could be a strong innovation to promote passive style of investing in the fixed income space.\\n Passive investing is now getting more emphasis, and as index-based investing offers diversification, transparency, and liquidity, there are positive signals that with growing investor education and awareness, India could witness more growth in the days to come.

However, the question remains: how significant is this weakness for the rest of the economy? I am in the camp that downplays the significance of the information embedded in stock prices: although very useful in theory, in practice, stock price movements are driven by the herd psychology of investors. Even so, it raises the issue of recession odds for 2019. Holiday markets are extremely thin, and the desire to take risk among fund managers is probably the lowest it gets during the year. It is actually surprising that violent moves over the holidays occur as infrequently as they do. We will not get a good feeling for investor sentiment until January. Should Policymakers Care? I started working in finance in the late 1990s, when Alan Greenspan was the Fed Chairman. Greenspan scandalised many traditional central bankers by paying attention to the stock market. In particular, I doubt that many Bundesbankers were even aware of the existence of stock markets. In my view, the traditionalists had a point. For example, if the Fed cut rates in response to the latest turbulence in the equity markets, there is a reasonable possibility that the stock market would come roaring back and risk-taking behaviour would end up even more deranged than it was in recent years. When that risk-taking goes bad, historians would tut-tut the central bankers and accuse them of panicking in response to transient market turbulence. What matters is credit. Unless there is a reason to believe that the flow of credit has been cut off, the stock market should be left to seek its own level. I would not exactly hike rates if the stock market is falling by about 1% per day, but that\\'s about it.\\n What is unusual this time is the panic in the executive branch. Although the Trump campaign wants to position Donald as a hard-headed businessman, it is abundantly clear that the administration panicked like small children in response to the fall in the stock market. (The evidence is the bizarre Mnuchin letter/tweet about bank liquidity.) The proper role of the administration is to act like grownups and offer vague platitudes (\"the business of America is business!\"). I doubt that level heads are going to be in surplus in the next crisis. Should Anyone Else Care? There are two reasons that we should care about the stock market (other than our own investment position).  The level of the stock market itself matters for the economy. The falling stock market is a signal that something else has gone horribly wrong in the economy.  I am firmly in the camp that #2 is perhaps correct, and am unimpressed with #1. I certainly do not have my finger on the pulse of the economy. (I\\'ve been dealing with a handbook on breakeven inflation.) I will be turning to a book on recessions, and so, the possibility of a near-run recession is something that I will switch over to discussing at length in the New Year. Right now, I am unconvinced about recession odds, but I want to underline that is based on information that could very easily be out of date. As a result, I am agnostic on the question whether the fall in equities is telling us anything useful about the economy at large. That said, I do not have a lot of patience for theories that the equity market itself matters much for the economy. Take a look at recent history - we have had an equity boom since 2010, yet growth was at best tepid. The equity market is not really a source of capital; instead, it is where capital largely goes to die (stock buybacks at prices well above current levels). Equities represent a large portion of household sector balance sheets, but those holdings are concentrated within an ultra-rich cohort that does not have a great propensity to consume out of equity wealth. (Otherwise, we would have had an economic boom.)\\n Concluding Remarks Recessions will be a major focus of my writing in 2019. Whether or not that will be of topical relevance remains to be seen. Stay tuned!\\n']}\n"

Instead, US stock markets continued to tank. The Dow Jones dropped 653 points. The S&P 500 fell another 2.7% and officially entered into bear territory. It was the worst Christmas Eve on Wall Street in history. The Washington Post put it in stark terms. By the end of Monday\\'s shortened holiday trading session, the great bull market that began in the lows of March 2009 lay lifeless, capping a three-week, 16 percent sell-off of the S&P 500.\" As Peter Schiff put it, \"The Grinch stole the Santa Claus rally.\" It\\'s now official. Wall Street can stop pretending that it\\'s a correction. They have to admit that it\\'s a bear market.\"  Interestingly, there is still quite a bit of complacency. Peter said he doesn\\'t really see investors panicking - yet. I do think people are a little worried about the market now, but they\\'re not worried about the overall economy. They still don\\'t get it. They still haven\\'t connected the dots between the stock market and the economy.\" He said this is not just your run-of-the-mill bear market. Most people, if I listen to these experts talk about it, \\'OK, it\\'s a bear market. Oh, been there, done that. No big deal. Yes, we\\'ve had bear markets before but hey, it\\'s an opportunity to buy stocks.\\'... People still think it\\'s a regular bear market. It\\'s not.\" What makes this bear market different is the bull market that preceded it. Not only was it the longest bull market in history, it\\'s the first bull market totally created by the Federal Reserve. This is the mania that the Fed built. And it was built on quantitative easing, which we have never done before, zero percent interest rates, which we never had before. And not only was this a stock market entirely built by monetary policy, but this was probably the first time the entire economy has rested on the foundation of that stock market bubble. This was all about the market, about confidence, about the wealth effect. And so when this bull market ends, this phony recovery that was built on that phony foundation comes collapsing down. And people don\\'t get that yet.\"\\n This is not just the stock market going down. The economy is going into recession, and the bubble has grown for so long and gotten so big, nobody realizes it has popped. When you are in a bubble and don\\'t recognize that you are in a bubble you never know that the bubble has popped. You don\\'t see any of the signs because you don\\'t even know to look for the signs. And all you do is try to rationalize what\\'s going on and try to minimize the significance. But when the Fed does come back with QE and zero percent rates, initially it will be heralded as good news... No! Because this time it isn\\'t going to work. As soon as they do that, the dollar\\'s decline is going to turn into a rout. Gold\\'s rally is going to turn into a rocket ship up. And the economy is not going to recover. It\\'s going to sink. We\\'ll go from recession to stagflation.\" Peter goes on to talk about the political ramifications. He said in the end, Trump is going to come out looking a lot like Jimmy Carter.\\n']}\n",

Each week we do the following:  discuss an important issue for traders; highlight several technical trading methods, including current ideas; feature advice from top traders and writers; and provide a few (minority) reactions from fundamental analysts.  We also have some fun. We welcome comments, links, and ideas to help us improve this resource for traders. If you have some ideas, please join in! Review: Is Technical Damage Driving The Market?  Our previous Stock Exchange asked the question: Is technical damage driving this market? We noted that the S&P 500 had broken critical technical support levels, it sank further below its closely-watched 50-day and 200-day moving averages, and it hit a new low for 2018. However, we encouraged traders to remember that markets are driven by both technicals (often in the shorter-term) and economic and fundamental factors in the longer-term. Further, keeping technicals, fundamentals and economics in mind, traders should be sure to follow a strategy that is consistent with their personal needs and goals. This Week: Are You Staying Level-Headed In This Crazy Market? The Dow Jones just posted its biggest one-day point gain in history, on the day after Christmas, a day that is supposed to be relatively quiet. \\n\\n\\n Yet despite Wednesday\\'s face-ripper, the market is still down significantly for the quarter (and the year), as shown in the chart above. While we discussed last week that \"technical damage\" could be driving the market lower, there are obviously other things going on, such as tariffs and the Fed. And according to this recent article, UBS economist Rob Martin believes: \"right now, at least – tariffs and the Fed are the two biggest obstacles to the market.\" And per that same article, Data Trek Research co-founder Nick Colas thinks: \"although a certain level of uncertainty won\\'t kill a bull market, there are too many loose ends to tie up at once right now, and that could delay a rally in the beginning of the new year.\" But perhaps a bigger question regarding the current crazy market is: are you staying sane? When markets sell off in volatile fashion, traders need to keep their emotions in check. According to Brett Steenbarger, investors may want to heed The Psychology of Trading a Crazy Market. Specifically, Steenbarger writes: \"An important priority in trading crazy markets is doubling down on our own sanity. That means mentally--and emotionally--rehearsing being wrong on trades so that we are prepared to take the right actions if the stuff hits the fan.\" Also worth a listen, Steenbarger recently participated in a podcast with J.C. Parets of All Star Trading, where they discuss: \"how the volatility of markets can induce our own emotional and behavioral volatility.\" The podcast is worth a listen. Exiting Trading Positions: Regarding our own trading models, we have a variety of risk management signals and procedures. For example, when near-term market conditions are not favorable, we will exit all of our open trading positions. And in fact, based on the signal from our models, we have exited from all of our trading positions in the Athena, Felix and Road Runner models. Just to reiterate, this step is a risk control measure rather than a prediction of the market going down. These models will be getting back to the market when conditions are better. Also worth noting, our Holmes trading model is not affected since it has an independent set of requirements and stops (Holmes can take care of itself).\\n Model Performance: We are sharing the performance of our proprietary trading models, as our readers have requested, as shown in the following table: \\n\\n  We find that blending a trend-following / momentum model (Athena) with a mean reversion / dip-buying model (Holmes) provides two strategies, effective in their own right, that are not correlated with each other or with the overall market. By combining the two, we can get more diversity, lower risk, and a smoother string of returns. For more information about our trading models (and their specific trading processes), click through at the bottom of this post for more information. Also, readers are invited to write to main at newarc dot com for our free, brief description of how we created the Stock Exchange models. Expert Picks From The Models: Note: This week\\'s Stock Exchange is edited by Blue Harbinger, a source for independent investment ideas. Holmes: I purchased Coca-Cola European Partners (CCEP) on Wednesday, on a price dip. How do you feel about that? \\n\\nBlue Harbinger: What? American Coke is not good enough for you Holmes? Just kidding, I know CCEP distributes the same Coca-Cola, Diet Coke, Coke Zero, and many others, in Europe. But why did you buy? Holmes: I am a dip-buyer. My typical holding period is six weeks. For risk management, I use price targets, stops and I monitor macro conditions. And unlike the other traders, I did not exist my positions. I am a contrarian through and through. \\n BH: Interesting pick. Coca-Cola is one of those Steady Eddie blue-chip dividend payers that all the aggressive growth guys hate. But these low beta shares have performed very well this year, especially this quarter as just about everything else has sold off relatively hard. Here is a look at the Fast Graph. \\n\\n Holmes: Thanks for that information, but to remind you, I typically hold for about 6 weeks only. Your long-term fundamental metrics are less important to met. BH: Suit yourself, Holmes. And how about you Felix, any trades to share this week? Felix: I just exited all my open positions as a precautionary risk management move. Market conditions have gotten crazy. I will wait for things to settle down again before my next trade. However, I did run the Nasdaq 100 through my model, and my top 20 rankings are listed below. \\n\\n BH: Thanks for that info, I appreciate rankings, but remind us--what is your trading style? Felix: I am a momentum trader. I typically hold for around 66 weeks. I use stops and pay attention to macro conditions for risk management reasons. And as you know, I just exited all my trades because near-term conditions have gotten a bit unhealthy. Again, not a bet on market direction--just risk management. BH: Okay. Thank you for that. And how about you Oscar? As our resident ETF trader, do you have anything to share? Oscar: Yes. This week I ran our Comprehensive and Diverse ETF universe through my model, and the top 20 are ranked in the following list.\\n \\n\\n BH: Interesting. And remind us, what is your trading strategy? Oscar: I am into momentum. I typically hold for 6 weeks, and then I usually rotate into a new sector or style ETF. BH: Thanks Oscar. I\\'d ask Athena and Road Runner if they have any trades to share, but I already know what they are. Like Felix, they just exited all of their open trades because near-term trading conditions are not healthy for their technical models. Which is fine, because I know they\\'ll be back when conditions settle down--it\\'s all part of their process.  Conclusion: When market conditions get wild, it becomes more important than ever to stay psychologically level-headed; don\\'t let your emotions drive you to make bad trades. Our trading process leads us to close open trading positions when near-term conditions become unhealthy. And that is exactly what several of our trading models just did. Felix, Road Runner and Athena just exited all of their open positions; not because they\\'re betting on market direction, but rather for risk-management purposes. They will re-enter when market conditions settle down and become more conducive for their specific trading styles.

That criticism is ill-founded. It\\'s not that the Fed is simply replenishing its arsenal for the next downturn. The subtext of normalization is that economic fundamentals, not market-friendly monetary policy, will finally determine asset values. The Fed, it is to be hoped, is finally coming clean on the perils of asset-dependent growth and the long string of financial bubbles that has done great damage to the US economy over the past 20 years. Just as Paul Volcker had the courage to tackle the Great Inflation, Jerome Powell may well be remembered for taking an equally courageous stand against the insidious perils of the Asset Economy. It is great to be a fan of the Fed again.

It didn\\'t take much to persuade the bargain hunters into action, as early retailer reports are all pointing to a strong holiday season, while investors took comfort in Kevin Hassett\\'s, chairman of the White House Council of Economic Advisers, affirmation that Jerome Powell\\'s job is \"100 per cent\" safe. And oil bulls finally had something to cheer about with WTI recovering north of 9%, reflecting gains in US equity markets but also supply discussions. The surge in online purchases over the holiday season should be a reminder for the markets never to underestimate the purchasing power of the US consumer, as Mastercard payments tracking between November 1 and Christmas Eve leaped 5.1% from a year ago. This data comes at the perfect time and will provide a huge relief for investors, who had to watch with sheer horror the Christmas Eve plunge. There was a good buzz to buy the dip, given the US underlying data suggested the latest rout was far too extreme and unwarranted. And indeed, for long-term investors who are more apt to weather the volatile times, which aren\\'t about to leave the picture anytime soon, post-Xmas equity market bargains were there for the taking. But this recovery should put to rest the feverish fear-mongering that had investors believing the investment world as we know it was coming to an end. And adding to the positive vibe were reports that a U.S. government delegation will travel to Beijing in the week of January 7 to hold trade talks with Chinese officials. But don\\'t get too comfortable, as discussions regarding the various political and policy questions remain hanging in the balance. Expect those conversations to continue Thursday amid a particularly light economic calendar.\\n Oil Markets Oil bulls are breathing a collective sigh of relief this morning, as the robust tone in global equity markets helped provide the perfect springboard for a massive rally in both WTI and Brent to ensue. A clear signal that the oil market tumult was rooted in the equity market volatility, where investor sentiment has been weighted down by the unfortunate events in Washington, higher US interest rates, China\\'s economic slowdown and the omnipresent US-China trade dispute. But the real kicker for oil markets was the reaffirmation from Russian Energy Minister Novak, who voiced expectations for a more stable market in H1 2019 and, most importantly, suggested 100% cooperation among OPEC and its allies in supporting the market. Also, Novak supported recent comments from other OPEC ministers indicating Russia\\'s willingness to make deeper production cut if needed. Russia always remains a wild card, so with Novak singing the OPEC compliance tune, it\\'s providing a massive boost to sentiment. While the demand-side issue lingers, the overnight moves go a long way to righting the ship, while reversing out much of questionable pre-Xmas sell-off that was lacking in any pure fundamental basis. For good record, The American Petroleum Institute weekly statistical bulletin for the week ended December 21 has been delayed until 4:30 PM EST on Thursday. The DOE Weekly Petroleum Status Report will follow at 11:00 AM EST on Friday. Gold Markets A case of too fast, too soon given the US economic fundamentals were not screaming panic while fear-mongering was steering the ship. Still, various political and policy questions remain hanging in the balance, not to mention an endless laundry list of concerns around Brexit and Trade wars which should keep gold prices bid on dips. I still expect $ 1300+ in 2019, as given the recent equity market shellacking, unless there is significant progress on the trade front, the Fed will most likely hold off raising rates until mid-2019, which should be supportive from gold prices. So, gold should continue to glitter in the risky environment despite overnight profit-taking triggered by surging equity markets and a stronger USD. Near-term support now comes in at $1260, indeed a bullish flip when I need to add $5 to my support channel for four consecutive days.\\n Currency Markets Improved equity market sentiment and Kevin Hassett\\'s support for Fed Chair Powell was a boost to US capital market sentiment, which saw the USD flourish overnight. USDJPY and EURUSD have both recalibrated 75-100 pips in USD\\'s favour, US yields provided some support for USD, as US 10-year yields moved towards 2.8% following the 5-year auction, which saw a 2.3 bp tail. On USDJPY, with the lack of follow-through below 110, and with US equity markets stabilising yesterday, traders were pairing USDJPY stop losses around 110.75, anticipating a swift equity market correction if there\\'s no selling in the US session. Fairly prophetic, as those stops were triggered overnight, but USDJPY lower remains a favourite trade for G-10 traders. On the EURUSD, the great debate continues, with analysts expecting the ECB to hike next year, while traders are taking a more pragmatic view based on the horrible EU economic data. But as we find markets trading the very familiar 1.1300 handle, range-trade mentality will likely kick in once again. Malaysian Ringgit The local unit should take solace in surging oil prices, along with the bullish flip in global equity markets. These are two significant positives for Malaysian capital markets, despite the stronger USD.\\n']}\n"

Two of the most common are that fundamentals direct the stock market and that you cannot fight the Fed. While I have provided much evidence and explanation as to why the former is a falsehood, allow me to provide you proof that central banks are not in control as much as many seem to believe. In fact, we often hear discussions about the PPT - the Plunge Protection Team. So, what is this \"Team?\" After the market crash of 1987, President Ronald Reagan created the President\\'s Working Group on Financial Markets to recommend solutions for enhancing U.S. financial markets, preventing significant volatility, and maintaining investor confidence. The group consisted of the Secretary of the Treasury and the Chairmen\\'s of the Federal Reserve, the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission. Thereafter, this \"Working Group\" became known as the Plunge Protection Team, and many believed that this \"Team\" would intervene at the appropriate moments to prevent significant volatility in the markets, which would, thereby, prevent market crashes in the future. As the myth has been perpetuated, it can supposedly do this by convincing banks to buy stock index futures, or by having the Federal Reserve do the buying. The goal was supposedly to allow markets to correct in an \"orderly\" fashion so as to \"maintain investor confidence\" in our equity markets. Since 1987, I don\\'t think that anyone can fool themselves into believing that we have not experienced periods of significant volatility, despite the PPT/Central Bank being \"on the job.\" In fact, the following instances are just some of the highlights of volatility since the supposed inception of the Plunge Protection Team:\\n  February of 2001: Equity markets declined of 22% within seven weeks; September of 2001: Equity markets declined 17% within three weeks; July of 2002: Equity markets declined 22% within three weeks; September of 2008: Equity markets declined 12% within one week; October of 2008: Equity markets declined 30% within two weeks; November of 2008: Equity markets declined 25% within three weeks; February of 2009: Equity markets declined 23% within three weeks. May of 2010: Equity markets experienced a \"Flash Crash.\" Specifically, the market started out the day down over 30 points in the S&P 500 and proceeded to lose another 70 points within minutes. That is a loss of 9% in one day, but the market did manage to close down only 3.1% in one day! July of 2011: Equity markets declined 18% within two weeks August 2015: Equity markets declined 11% within one week January 2016: Equity markets declined 13% within three weeks January 2018: Equity markets declined 16% within three weeks October 2018: Equity markets declined 12% within three weeks December 2018: Equity market declines 16% within 3 weeks  Based upon these facts, you can even argue that significant stock market \"plunges\" have become more common events since the advent of the Plunge Protection Team, especially since we have experienced more significant \"plunges\" within the 20 years after the supposed creation of the \"Team\" than in the 20-year period before. Moreover, I have outlined in the past that central banks are not even in control of their own currencies, despite strong belief to the contrary. Back in July 2011, I was expecting a multi-year 3rd wave rally to take hold from the low 70s in the DXY with an ideal target of 103.53. Now, I want to remind you again that when I made this call back in July of 2011, the DXY hit a low of 73.42. So, that meant I was expecting a 41% rally in the DXY. And, in the FOREX world, that is a massive move. \\n\\n\\n As you can see from the attached chart from 2011, I was looking for a major 2nd wave low being struck in the DXY, followed by a multi-year rally wave 3 to the 101-103.53 region. Moreover, I also want to remind you that I maintained this expectation when the Fed was throwing their QE bazookas at the market. For this reason, most market participants at the time were quite certain that the dollar was going to crash. So, most likely viewed my call for a multi-year rally in the dollar as ridiculous, and that is putting it mildly. So, even with all that QE being thrown at the dollar, we still saw the massive rally in the DXY that I was expecting. Yes, this was certainly counter-intuitive to common market expectations. But this was a clear case study in the fact that the fundamentals or the Fed did not control this market, while market sentiment was the clear driver of price, as our analysis of market sentiment kept us on the correct side of what was an \"unexpected\" market rally. Moreover, as the Fed began rate hikes, many were certain that it will be a catalyst for the dollar to rally strongly. However, I was looking for the dollar to enter into a multi-year pullback once we struck our long-term target. Now, despite the Fed raising rates, once the market slightly exceeded our long-term target (the high struck in the DXY was 103.82, whereas our target from 2011 was 103.53), the DXY began to pull back as we have expected. Yet, most who believe that the Fed controls this market seem to be in disbelief, as the DXY \"should\" have been rallying when the Fed was tightening. You see, commonly understood economic theory suggested that reducing the available debt through the QT process \"should have\" caused the dollar to rally. But, clearly, that is not what happened. The same has happened with the Chinese Yuan. By the middle of 2017, China spent 1 trillion US Dollars (a quarter of their FX reserves) over the prior 3 years in an attempt to prop up the Yuan. However, the Yuan still lost close to 14% of its value against the USD over this time period.\\n Ultimately, when truly tested, as in the situations above, the markets have moved completely opposite the \"manipulation\" attempts by the central banks. They have proven themselves powerless in the face of market forces. The market will do what the market will do despite the actions of the Central Banks. Believing otherwise is ignoring the truth in the market as presented by history and price action, and replacing it with the logical fallacy that correlation equates to causation. But I can assure you that those that maintain these fallacious beliefs will feel significant financial pain when the next crash does occur, and the Fed will be powerless to stop it. If you need another example, several years ago, the folks at Elliott Wave International put together a long-term study of T-Bill rates between 2000 and 2012, representing how the Fed clearly follows the market and does not lead. \\n\\n If you are still not convinced, of late, we have seen yet another example of how the Fed and the market seem to be at odds. I want to show you a few charts from the last several months during which the Fed was raising rates. First, in October of this year, I began preparing the members of The Market Pinball Wizard for an impending change of trend in the TLT. For those of you that may not know, the TLT is the iShares 20+ Year Treasury Bond ETF, which seeks to track the investment results of an index composed of U.S. Treasury bonds with remaining maturities greater than twenty years. \\n\\n\\n So, as you can see from the attached chart, I was looking a bit lower in the TLT before a strong expectation of a turn higher in this fund. Moreover, when price in the TLT turns higher, it means rates are turning lower. \\n\\n Now, in November, you will see that we hit my \"Major Support\" target in the TLT. But, as I explained in the chat to my members, I thought we would get one more lower low. In fact, I noted that I was going to be a buyer at the 113 region in the TLT, with my longer-term target represented by the box in the upper right side of the chart. Again, take note that my expectation was that we would see a rally off this support region. Moreover, consider that this was during a period of time in which the Fed was quite clear of its intentions to continue raising rates. \\n\\n If you take a look at the chart as it stands today, we got that lower low in the TLT, and the market then reacted quite strongly to the upside. And, interestingly again, this was during a period of time in which the Fed was quite clear of its intentions to continue raising rates. So, you tell me, is the Fed in control, or is market sentiment in control? Maybe the better title for my article would have been \"Clear Evidence That The Fed Was Never Really In Control!?\"\\nThe Market Pinball Wizard\\n\\n“Your service is the best $$ I have spent all year!”\\n“I have been active in the markets my whole adult life for over 30 years. When I found Avi Gilburt I knew something was not only different, but much better than any analyst I had ever encountered.”\\n“There is NO BETTER analyst on the planet than Avi Gilburt\\'s \"The Market Pinball Wizard\"!”\\n“I have been following you for a year and your accuracy is amazing. I am an old timer and I have never seen anything like it.”\\n\\nClick here for a FREE TRIAL.\\nDisclosure: I am/we are long TLT. I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions.

At the opposite extreme, broadly defined commodities continue to post the deepest shade of red ink for the major asset classes. The choice of the five-year annualized return to rank funds from a value perspective is inspired by \"Value and Momentum Everywhere,\" a 2013 Journal of Finance paper by AQR Capital Management\\'s Cliff Asness and two co-authors. There\\'s a wide set of value metrics, but as an initial screen across asset classes and its subsets, there\\'s a case for using a simple performance review. Why? It\\'s easy and facilitates the analysis across a broad range of assets on an apples-to-apples basis. On that basis, let\\'s review the state of value pricing across a broad range of markets. The ranking below covers 135 exchange-traded products that run the gamut: US and foreign stocks, bonds, real estate, commodities and currencies. (You can find the full list here, sorted in descending order by annualized five-year return - based on 1,260 trading days - through yesterday, Dec. 26). Note that the full playing field becomes quite granular in spots. In equities, for instance, the ETF list ranges from broad regional definitions (Asia, Latin America, etc.) to country funds, down to US sectors (energy, financials, for instance) and industries (e.g., oil & gas equipment & services). The only restriction is what\\'s available for US exchange-listed funds. Otherwise, the search is broad and deep, or at least as deep as permitted given the current lineup of ETFs. Let\\'s begin with the major asset classes for a top-down review. Once again, broadly defined commodities continue to post the steepest five-year loss in this category: iPath Bloomberg Commodity (NYSEARCA:DJP) is under water by an annualized -10.3%. That\\'s far deeper vs. the next-steepest loss: VanEck Vectors JP Morgan Emerging Market Local Currency Bond (NYSEARCA:EMLC), which is down a relatively modest -1.9% on an annualized basis over the last five years.\\n \\n\\n The next table shows the 20 deepest losses for the full list of funds. It\\'s dominated by commodities, peppered with equities in a handful of emerging markets, including VanEck Vectors Africa (NYSEARCA:AFK), which has lost an annualized -6.0% over the past five years. For various reasons, the crowd is heavily discounting the future for equity markets across the African continent. As such, AFK offers one of the stronger value plays in the international equity space. \\n\\n\\n']}\n",

The company is divided in three segments:  Adhesive technologies Beauty care Laundry & home care  Overview In the adhesive technologies segment Henkel has a globally leading position. In beauty the company is #3, in laundry & home care #1 in Europe and #2 in north America. The revenue is nearly split in half between adhesive technologies and beauty care/ laundry & home care. Figure 1: revenue breakdown by business unit \\n\\n Source: Henkel roadshow presentation 2018 In adhesive technologies Henkel produces all types of adhesives. Additionally, sealants and functional coatings are produced. Henkel sells to private customers with the brands Pattex and Pritt and to industrial customers with the brands Loctite, Technomelt or Teroson. Furthermore, is the iPhone held together by a Henkel adhesive. Henkel is producing hair cosmetics products, hairdressing products, personal care products, skin care products and oral hygiene products. The most famous brands are Schwarzkopf, Syoss, FA and Got2b in their beauty care segment. In the last segment, the laundry & home care segment, Henkel offers detergents, dishwashing detergents, toilet cleaners and air fresheners. The brands are Persil, Pril and Weißer Riese. Henkel is very well positioned for growth in emerging countries as the revenue breakdown by region shows. (Figure 2) The goal for Henkel is to make more than 50% in emerging markets where the organic growth is much higher than in Western Europe and North America. One reason behind this is that more and more people reach the middle class and therefore a higher standard of living with better hygiene.\\n Figure 2: revenue breakdown by region \\n\\n Source: Henkel roadshow presentation 2018 Brands With their strong brands it is possible to enforce higher prices and with these earnings Henkel is able to acquire competitors and invest in their own growth. The advantage of a strong brand in the consumer goods is the pricing power. Most people trust their products and therefore are “blindly” buying the product. Humans are creatures of habits. Figure 3: overview brands \\n\\n Source: Brands & Businesses Competition In their consumer goods fields the most known competitor is Procter & Gamble. But this competition exists for many decades and both companies have shown that they can grow in coexistence. To protect itself from competition Henkel is acquiring smaller competitors and in emerging markets to lay the foundation stone for solid, long-term growth. With their 2016 acquisition of The Sun Products Corporation is #2 in the US detergent business. Strategy & Management Their 2020 plan is shown in Figure 4. Figure 4: Financial ambitions 2020 \\n\\n Source: Henkel roadshow presentation 2018 The management is long-term focused and not rushing into expensive acquisitions. Henkel has a budget of a few billion Euros for that and is waiting for a good opportunity. One factor for their long-term orientation is that 61% of the stock is family held. The family has a high interest in a sustainable corporate development.\\n Since 2016 over 10 companies were acquired and seamlessly integrated which shows the ability of the management to find well suited companies. However, a future fallback is not excluded. Dividend and free cashflow The dividend is very impressive for Henkel. Since 2009 the company was able to quadruple the dividend. The dividend was not cut in the last 25 years. The current dividend yield is at around 1.8% not quite high. But only 30% of the earnings are distributed to shareholders and the growth is strong. A strong free-cashflow and an asset-light business model is securing the dividend as not much of the free cashflow hast to be reinvested and can be used for dividends, acquisitions and stock buybacks. Figure 5: free cashflow (yellow highlighted) \\n\\n Source: Morningstar The average free cashflow for the period between 2013 and 2017 was €1.7 billion. The balance sheet looks very healthy with an equity ratio of 56% and a net financial position of €-3.2 billion as per Q3 2018. Therefore, Henkel is nearly debt free as the debt is paid back with one year’s operative earnings. Figure 5 shows not a frequent dividend as Morningstar seems to have not all the data. At Figure 6 from the Henkel roadmap presentation it is possible to see the track record of the dividend with the strong growth of 13.5% p.a. Figure 6: dividend history \\n\\n Source: Henkel roadshow presentation 2018 Risks The biggest risk is a worsening competitive situation. It is possible that big distributors like Amazon, Walmart or a European discounter introduce more private labels. With this scenario Henkel would be losing many customers. Henkel is working against it with strong brand building and through digitalization. Digital sales are growing double-digit and on track to achieve over €4 billion by 2020.\\n Another risk is a temporary or permanent damage of the image of an important brand. It could be through an unfair business practice, defective quality or old mistakes like currently seen at Johnson and Johnson where the stock got hit. For their business in general a recession would primarily hit the adhesive segment as the customers of Henkel would not be producing as today. Valuation I used my own earnings model to value the stock. The general assumption is a 12% discount rate. Yes, it may look like a high discount rate for a consumer goods stock but with the discount rate I am protecting myself. First, against a recession in the future. I am not able to time a recession and I don’t know how long the recession will last. Second, I am protecting myself against errors in my estimations. If they are not right, I may end up with a still above average return. Finally, I use a high discount rate for all my investments to make them a bit more comparable. I divided my calculation in three scenarios with different probabilities:  Scenario 1 is the worst-case scenario: Henkel is not able to improve their margin a lot and not able to achieve their set goal of growth. (25% probability) Scenario 2 is the best: It is possible to grow their margin and earnings above their expectations. (25% probability) Scenario 3 is the normal scenario: growth rate like it is expected. (50% probability)  All three scenarios result in overvalued or undervalued which is calculated by subtracting the current stock price of ordinary shares of EUR 84 from the present value sum. Undervalued would mean that the calculated value is higher than the current stock price. In the last table the parts of the present sum value are added up accordingly to my assumptions. Figure 7: earnings model \\n\\n\\n Source: Own calculation Conclusion My calculation results in a stock price of around EUR 87. The preferred shares are the more liquid class of Henkel shares as they are listed in the German stock index (\"DAX\"). Therefore, they are trading above the ordinary shares at EUR 97. The ordinary shares have a 2 cent (€1.77 vs €1.79) lower dividend but are trading around 10-15% below the preferred shares. For US-investors it is possible to buy preferred ADRs (OTCPK:HENOY) and ordinary ADRs (OTCPK:HENKY) As the ordinary shares are trading at EUR 84 the stock is undervalued because my calculated fair value is above the current stock price. The solid business model, the near debt free balance sheet and the growth in emerging markets are convincing me.\\nDisclosure: I am/we are long HENKY. I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions. I am not receiving compensation for it (other than from Seeking Alpha).

Permian - It\\'s not like 2016 In the midst of the previous oil crisis just 3 short years earlier, the Permian was still being discovered as the new prime shale play of the US. Multi-pad horizontal drilling was just being discovered as the be all for US shale, so the Permian received a lot of capital inflows. \\n\\n Permian producers and private equity raised a record amount in early 2016 to pile into the Permian. Deals were being done at $43k per acre, and producers like Parsley Energy (PE), one of the worst offenders in the Permian basin, grew production from 25k boe/d to 120k boe/d. \\n\\n\\n Source: Parsley Energy \\n\\n To put the obscenity of Parsley Energy into perspective, Parsley clocked in -$6.6 billion over the last 5 years. It increased debt from $677 million to $2.181 billion. Its share count increased from 55 million shares to 321 million shares. In essence, you can see that the 25k boe/d growth to 120k boe/d was all externally funded. The company would have never gotten to this size without external capital. Why is this significant? Because one of the biggest abusers of how shale was able to access cheap capital just came out this week announcing the lowest y-o-y growth since 2014. On Dec. 19, Parsley announced its capex budget for 2019, it read as follows:  The Company estimates that capital expenditures of $1.35-$1.55 billion will translate to total production of 124-134 MBoe per day and oil production of 80-85 MBo per day in 2019, representing year-over-year production growth of approximately 20% on both measures. Parsley plans to deploy 12-to-14 development rigs and three-to-four frac spreads on average in 2019, down from a recent run-rate of 16 development rigs and five frac spreads. Parsley\\'s baseline capital budget assumes a $50 WTI oil price in 2019 and a relatively static service cost environment. In this context, the Company would expect to outspend cash flow from operations by less than $250 million during 2019, representing a projected year-over-year decline of more than 50%. (1) Even in a lower oil price scenario, Parsley would target a maximum outspend of $250 million, accomplished through incremental activity reductions, likely in combination with lower service and equipment costs. In a higher oil price scenario, Parsley would remain disciplined and would not plan to increase equipment levels in 2019 compared to those associated with the baseline budget. \\n We bolded the parts we thought were significant developments for the biggest Permian external capital abuser. In the press release, Parsley reiterated that the capex budget only represents 20% production growth y-o-y. In addition, the company is still outspending cash flow to get this growth figure of $250 million. And if oil prices move up, the company will remain disciplined. There\\'s something really significant here people are not realizing. First, PE\\'s growth of 20% year-over-year is a yearly average figure. For example, in the first 3 quarters, Parsley produced:  Q3 2018: 116.2k boe/d Q2 2018: 107.8k boe/d Q1 2018: 93.4K boe/d  And at the moment, PE is guiding 120k boe/d for Q4 2018. Now if you take PE\\'s guidance at the midrange for 2019, it is 129k boe/d. In order to reach that production figure on an average y-o-y, PE would need to exit around 140k boe/d. That\\'s a growth of 16.7% exit-to-exit, a far cry from the stupid growth of 40% it was trying to register just the year before. If PE is just one of the examples of the Permian, another pinnacle moment came this week when Centennial\\'s (NASDAQ:CDEV) Mark Papa announced that it was scrapping its plan of reaching 65k bo/d by 2020. The significance of Mark Papa\\'s announcement is that Centennial was private equity backed. In the private equity industry, what Mark Papa says is like the equivalent of what Warren Buffett said in the investing world. In the securities filing, CDEV said: In light of the current oil macro environment, Centennial Resource Development, Inc. (\"Centennial\" or the \"Company\") is no longer targeting a production goal of 65,000 barrels of oil per day (\"Bo/d\") for calendar year 2020. Additionally, the previously anticipated 2.5 drilling rig addition in 2019 required to achieve 65,000 Bo/d in 2020, which was mentioned during Centennial\\'s Third Quarter 2018 earnings call, is no longer current. The Company will release full year 2019 production, capital budget and unit cost guidance in the Company\\'s next earnings release, which is expected to be held in late February. The 2019 capital budget will reflect management\\'s objective of maintaining Centennial\\'s strong balance sheet.\\n In Q3 2018, CDEV produced 36k bo/d and it produced 62.9k boe/d. The 36k barrels of oil per day was the metric CDEV was guiding for into 2020. This would have almost doubled CDEV\\'s production within just 2 years if it continued this blistering pace of growth. The idea was to bring the company to a big enough size to start self-sustaining a lot of the capital spending. But this oil price downturn is forcing even the most nimble and low debt producers like CDEV to start spending within cash flow. Lastly, the biggest reason this time is not like 2016 is that not only are capital markets reluctant to plunge into shale again after years of burning capital, but there is no capital on the sidelines. In an FT article published on Dec. 16 titled, \"US credit markets dry up as volatility rattles investors.\" We quote as follows: US credit markets are grinding to a halt with fund managers refusing to bankroll buyouts and investors shunning high-yield bond sales as rising interest rates and market volatility weigh on sentiment. Not a single company has borrowed money through the $1.2tn US high-yield corporate bond market this month. If that drought persists, it would be the first month since November 2008 that not a single high-yield bond priced in the market, according to data providers Informa and Dealogic. Not one company borrowed from the high-yield corporate bond market this month. Compare that to December 2017 (heading into 2018) when US shale producers borrowed the highest amount since 2014: \\n\\n Source: FT And on the private equity side, valuations in the Permian are being slashed with private companies like Endeavor receiving a 50% haircut to its valuation. There are also rumblings about private equity\\'s inability to raise capital going into 2019 as they contemplate running these shale producers with a multi-year outlook versus a \"grow at any cost and then sell it to a big producer\" mentality. Here is the Bloomberg article titled, \"Private Equity Shifting Shale Strategy to Long Haul.\" We quote as follows:\\n  Your challenge really is to optimize the play, rather than just find the play,\" said Newman, whose firm manages $6 billion in investments, with stakes in oil and gas ventures from Texas to Oklahoma and Canada. \"You should be prepared to take it all the way through to development.\" With the shale business maturing beyond its early, land-rush years, energy exits have gotten harder for private equity. Public drillers who\\'d once served as natural acquirers now face pressure from their own investors to rein in spending. The result: So far this year, equity firms announced or completed 43 oil and gas deals in North America, down from 59 last year and 73 in 2016, according to Bloomberg data. Acquisition values have totaled $9.5 billion, from about $15 billion the past two years.  \\n\\n What happens if the Permian slows even a little? With oil prices where it is today, the market is completely ignoring the fact of what happens to the supply/demand equation if US shale just slows down for 3 months. We are not even talking about a decline in production but a mere flattening of production for 3 months. \\n\\n Now, even if we assume US oil production exits 2019 at 12.9 mb/d, this is what happens. At the moment, the oil price sell-off will have a lagging effect on US oil production. Again, people forget the fact that we are talking about a year-over-year average versus quarter-over-quarter. Because we are likely exiting Q4 2018 at 12 mb/d, a mere flattening of US oil production into Q1 2019 will push growth rates of 20% y-o-y to just 15% y-o-y. This seems like a very conservative and fair assumption to make. We then factor in WTI to start rebounding to $85/bbl by year-end 2019 with US shale climbing steadily starting in April 2019 by ~100k b/d per month.\\n Now we combine this with the fact that OPEC has already preannounced the extension of the production cut after April, and the end result is a global oil market that\\'s severely undersupplied. \\n\\n \\n\\n Without logic, there will be unintended consequences We keep going back to the point that we are making which is that there are serious repercussions for the oil markets going forward and the global economy. By punishing oil prices low in the heart of capex planning season, the market is striking fear into the heart of US shale producers. We saw the biggest offender of Permian external capital fundraising come out this week to dial back exit-to-exit growth to 16.7% while the frontier of the private equity frenzy (Mark Papa\\'s CDEV) scraps the entire idea of growing recklessly to reach a certain scale. These are significant events, but we are merely only pricing in a production growth stall in Q1 2019. And even using this conservative estimate, we have the global oil markets undersupplied by ~870k b/d for 2019! This is unprecedented! What we are ultimately saying is that the world will be shocked when global inventories continue to draw, because everyone has modeled in a \"glut\". When that reality wave hits, it will be too late to turn back the tide of undersupply, and OPEC may be less reluctant this time around to push the market back into oversupply to calm the markets.

It has been red and crimson and rouge for many days now. I have never been a fan of red, or its hues, and I am delighted to have seen the picture changing. The issue now is, will it continue in its new color scheme, and for how long? It is a difficult question to answer, no doubt. The Dow Jones Industrial Average surged 1,086.25 points on Wednesday. This was its biggest single-day point gain ever! It more than offset the 653 point drop in Monday\\'s session, which made history as the worst-ever Christmas Eve for the blue-chip index. The Grinch stole Christmas alright but Santa showed up late and set things straight. His sled just needed an overhaul. What, did you think that Santa Claus was just for kids? What\\'s wrong with you? The jolly old Elf showed up yesterday and if you didn\\'t see him? It is not my fault. There is something wrong with you, if you missed him. You just got a huge Christmas present and you didn\\'t know where it came from. Silly you! There is also a moral here about shorts. Not long pants or blue jeans or about any attire with cuffs but about shorts. I cannot quantify it but from everything that I hear the shorts got massacred. There was plenty of blood on the streets, several people have told me, and I suspect they are quite right. On a day like yesterday, if you were short, you were taken out to the wood shed and soundly walloped. Keep your eyes out for some hedge funds and some money managers that may have been severely spanked. Trouble may yet be brewing after a day like yesterday. It is true, the Grinch could still return. The wily old fellow could show up in the House leading a herd of Democrats screaming \"Impeach\" and that would be no good for the markets. I am NOT making a political statement here but one about the stability of the American government. Any impeachment process is decidedly market unfriendly. You may trust me here.  And the Grinch, with his Grinch-feet ice cold in the snow, stood puzzling and puzzling, how could it be so? It came without ribbons. It came without tags. It came without packages, boxes or bags. And he puzzled and puzzled \\'till his puzzler was sore. Then the Grinch thought of something he hadn\\'t before… - Dr. Seuss \\n In fact, for the markets, my biggest fear, and I have a number of them, is that the Democrats will try to impeach President Trump. If they begin the process they will drag in the NSA, the CIA, the FBI and God only knows who else. It will be an extremely unpleasant affair and likely drawn out, as the market drowns in the echoes of the Congressional threats and laments. Then there is our \"Game of Thrones\" with China that will become the \"Game of Groans\" if some solution is not reached at some point. This whole show is no good for either country and it is just a question of who blinks and when. It is \"Puff the Magic Dragon\" going at it with \"Uncle Sam\" and the war of words continues unabated. Let us just be thankful that it is just money we are concerned about and not the firing of any armaments. One is bad but the other is far worse. This whole thing is about global domination and control and who is kidding who? The Chinese are playing out the old children\\'s story. They are huffing and puffing and trying to blow the house down but I suspect, in the end, it will still be standing while the Chinese take medication for COPD. Let the wheezing begin. Then there is Brexit with Great Britain and the European Union dancing on the head of a pin. No Angels in sight, I fear, and the balancing act is precarious. One extraneous whiff and everyone could be in freefall. The greatest risk here, in my view, is a \"Hard Brexit\" that will be disastrous for everyone. If it begins to appear that this is the way we are heading then you better check your holdings of all of the British and European banks, money managers and insurance companies because real peril may be on the table. Then they will all stand around and ask just whose fault it was.  The nerve of those Who\\'s. Inviting me down there - and on such short notice. Even if I wanted to go my schedule wouldn\\'t allow it. Four o\\'clock, wallow in self-pity; 4:30, stare into the abyss; 5:00, solve world hunger, tell no one. 5:30, jazzercize. 6:30, dinner with me. I can\\'t cancel that again. 7:00, wrestle with my self-loathing; I\\'m booked. Of course, if I bump the loathing to 9:00 I could still be done in time to lay in bed, stare at the ceiling and slip slowly into madness. But what would I wear? - The Grinch \\n Yes, what will they wear? I am going to suggest a modified version of the Disney outfit. We can call it the \"Brexiteers\" and they can have funny ears, and everything, because it will be quite obvious that everyone was self-centered and no one listened to anyone else. In the meantime, the band plays on. Listen up!\\n']}\n",

Despite this, the company's performance has remained strong, and the company is a top-tier services company.Schlumberger is trading with a P/E of 18 at the bottom of the downcycle. That is a low P/E for a cycle bottom, and helps to show Schlumberger's earning potential.Schlumberger's turnkey solutions are taking off. In Saudi Arabia, the company anticipates almost 30 turnkey rigs running by 2019. This means increasing international revenue, and increasing profits.\"], 'article': ['Schlumberger (NYSE: SLB) is the world’s largest oilfield services company with a market cap of almost $50 billion. The company’s stock was performing respectfully until crashing by early-October by more than 40%. As we’ll see through this article, overall growth in capital spending combined with strong financials make the company a strong investment. \\n\\n Schlumberger - Schlumberger Schlumberger Growing Markets Schlumberger is the world’s largest oilfield services company and employs approximately 100 thousand people representing more than 140 nationalities in 85 countries. The company focuses on using its technological expertise to help bring oil from the ground. As a result, the company’s revenue and earnings are heavily dependent on oil prices. \\n\\n Schlumberger Capex - Schlumberger Investor Presentation As a result of the oil crash, which started in mid-2014, companies heavily cut their capital spending. The resulting 44% drop in annual capital spending resulted in a heavy drop in demand for Schlumberger’s services. However, the capital spending was well below replacement ratios as a result of the crash. $400 billion annual spending can’t support that much oil production.\\n However, from 2017 to 2018, the company’s capital spending increased by 12%. The company anticipates that capital spending in the oil markets should continue to increase going forward. As oil gets harder to remove, demand for Schlumberger’s service will increase. \\n\\n Schlumberger Production Decline - Schlumberger Investor Presentation More so, despite these low capex levels, production has actually continued to decline. The number of major projects passing FID (final investment decision) has decreased significantly. As a result, production has increased in Saudi Arabia, while production in every other major country has decreased. That is a massive drop in oil production. That shows that current investment levels aren’t enough. Recently, OPEC and their other allies have also agreed to drop production. That continued drop will in turn support growing oil prices. Growing oil prices will support more capital spending; in 2017 alone with a partial price recovery, projects almost recovered to their 2007-13 levels. As a result of these things, overall, capital spending should increase going forward. Schlumberger Services On top of Schlumberger’s impressive operation in growing markets with growing capital spending, the company’s services are becoming more essential. \\n\\n Schlumberger Well Performance - Schlumberger Investor Presentation  To lower costs, oil companies have been focused on maximizing efficiency, and Schlumberger’s support helps them to do just that. As you can see above, while the number of wells and their production is remaining fairly constant, or even dropping, the amount of proppant pumped per well has been increasing.\\n This all goes to say that oil drilling is becoming increasingly technical, and as a result, oil companies are relying more and more on the technology of Schlumberger, and the expertise it can provide. \\n\\n Schlumberger Technology Position - Schlumberger Investor Presentation  Looking at Schlumberger’s technology, the company is the #1 or #2 operator in the vast majority of all market segments. This helps to support the company’s impressive size. Schlumberger market cap is more than double the combined market cap of both Halliburton and Baker Hughes. That impressive size means the company can continue to dominate its peers. Schlumberger offers investors a full range of bundled services, and has heavy integration throughout the world. The company’s peer leading market positions and heavy integration mean that it’s a one stop shop to provide oil field services to companies. \\n\\n Schlumberger LSTK Wells - Schlumberger Investor Presentation  The first LSTK project was built in Latin America 20 years ago. The project is a lump sum turkey project, a project that can provide all of the drilling services that the customer needs. Since then, the projects have drilled 14 thousand wells over 25 years, with 500 projects managing 1000+ rigs. These projects provide a well-defined risk mitigation process. The integrated drilling approach provides an enormous opportunity. The project gathers the value generated by operational efficiency and reliability, two of the main goals of projects. Schlumberger then handles getting the oil from the ground.\\n The project is so capable that the single most famous oil drilling nation on the planet, Saudi Arabia has begun to use LSTK rigs. The company started in early-2018 with 10 rigs by 1Q 2018 and currently has 25 rigs. The company forecasts this eventually reaching almost 30 rigs by 2019. That is a massive growth in demand for Schlumberger’s operations. As a result, there were only 5 wells drilled in early-2018. This is anticipated to reach more than 150 wells by 2019. Saudi Arabia has a problem where it’s largest oil field, the Ghawar oil field, that produces half its production is declining. As a result, the country’s starting to use Schlumberger’s peer leading technology to achieve additional oil withdrawals. The majority of Schlumberger’s revenue is international, and that’ll grow going forward. Schlumberger Financials Now that we’ve discussed how the markets that Schlumberger is in are growing, and how the company’s services are peer-leading and essential, let’s move on to discussing the company’s financials. \\n\\n Schlumberger Financials v. Peers - Schlumberger Investor Presentation  Schlumberger has peer leading financial performance. As we saw above, the company’s market cap is larger than that of BHGE and Halliburton combined. The company’s annual revenue peaked at almost $50 billion in 2015, but has since dropped significantly. Still, the company’s 2018 revenue should be more than $30 billion and that should only increase going forward. At the same time, the company’s EBITDA margin dropped. However, the company’s EBITDA margin is still well above its peers. The company’s 2015 EBITDA margin was more than 30%, and subsequently dropped down to below 25%. That peer leading EBITDA margin with peer leading revenues, should result in peer leading profits.\\n Overall, at the end of the day, the company’s cash flow from operations have remained strong at almost $6 billion. The company’s annual dividend costs the company roughly $2.75 billion per year. That means the company’s cash flow is more than double the company’s dividends. More so, as capital spending increases, the company’s cash flow should recover. \\n\\n Schlumberger Earnings Profile - Schlumberger Earnings Filings Schlumberger is a company in the downcycle and based on the most recent GAAP earnings, is traded at a P/E of just 18. The company’s revenue and EPS have increased separately quarter over quarter and year over year, and will likely continue to increase going forward. This shows Schlumberger’s powerful earnings potential. Going forward Schlumberger’s earnings should continue to increase as it continues to gain additional revenue. These new earnings help to make Schlumberger a top-tier investment decision. Conclusion Schlumberger has had a difficult time since the start of the oil crash. The company’s performance took a turn for the worst the past few months, dropping by more than 40% since early-October. Despite this, the company continues to have incredibly strong performance, particularly from its turnkey solutions. The company’s earnings have increased significantly recently. The company’s P/E ratio in a downcycle is just 18. The company’s earnings on a GAAP basis increased 18% year over year and 48% sequentially. That is incredibly strong improvement in the company’s earnings. As capital spending increases, the company’s earnings will continue to increase, making it a good investment.\\nDisclosure: I am/we are long SLB.

In the five years with negative total returns for the S&P 500 since 1990, the Dividend Aristocrats have outperformed in each year. \\n\\n That has been the case again in 2018, the Dividend Aristocrats have outperformed the broad market by 2% as charted below. \\n\\nSource: Bloomberg That level of outperformance is small relative to previous equity market sell-offs of this magnitude. In the other three years in this sample period with double digit declines for the S&P 500 - 2001, 2002, and 2008 - the Dividend Aristocrats have outperformed the broad market by double digit percentages.  Part of the smaller relative outperformance could be driven by the fact that despite the recent rally, interest rates are still notably higher on the year. While the 10-yr Treasury yield is 50bp off its early November high of 3.24%, it is still about 40bp higher than where we started the year. The Dividend Aristocrats tend to be more interest rate sensitive than the rest of the equity market as their steady payout gives them more fixed income-like characteristics.\\n As I noted in From the Peak: S&P 500 Constituent-Level Returns, the distribution of the recent market move has been highly correlated. Dividend Aristocrats could be getting sold with the rest of the market as more investors use passive vehicles. This could provide opportunities for discerning dividend-focused investors. In this article, I will list for readers the performance of all of the Dividend Aristocrats since the market peak on September 20th. The list is sorted in ascending order by the return since that date in the second-to-last column in the table below. \\n\\nOf the 53 companies on the list, only 4 - Hormel Foods (HRL), Procter & Gamble (PCG), McCormick & Co (MKC) and McDonald\\'s (MCD) have produced positive returns. Thirty-seven companies have produced a total return of -10% or worse; nineteen companies are down more than 20%; water heater maker A.O. Smith (AOS) is down more than 30%.  With the equity market falling sharply, some investors may be looking for defensive plays that further limit downside risk, but retain some upside if the market rebounds. In \"Dividend Payments and Stock Price Crash Risk,\" authored by Jeong-Bon Kim of University of Waterloo, Le Luo of Huazhong University of Science and Technology, and Hong Xie of the University of Kentucky, the authors demonstrated the negative correlation between dividend payments and stock price crashes. Poor managers can not only risk a company\\'s ability to pay dividends but also expose a company to financial ruin. The paper suggested that a firm\\'s commitment to dividend payments reduces agency costs and lowers the risk of large-scale stock price drops. Dividend stocks outperform non-dividend paying stocks over time, but the highest yielding stocks can occasionally be value traps that fail to pay sustainable dividends to investors. Hopefully, Seeking Alpha readers understand the need to ignore the siren song of simply buying stocks based on yield alone. Historically, that strategy has also underperformed; buying stocks with sustainable dividend yields has generated better long-run performance with lower risk. What better way to demonstrate dividend sustainability than to pay increasing dividends for multiple business cycles. Investing in the Dividend Aristocrats in not a particularly high dividend strategy, but owning the underlying companies has delivered risk-adjusted outperformance over time. With markets under pressure, and the Dividend Aristocrats just marginally outperforming, this list could prove valuable to dividend-focused investors looking for opportunities.\\n Disclaimer: My articles may contain statements and projections that are forward-looking in nature, and therefore inherently subject to numerous risks, uncertainties and assumptions.

Is it time to buy the dip or is the smart money long gone?\"], 'article': [' Stock Prices: Pure Crisis? Shipping stocks have been caught in the absolute crossfire between the small cap and oil price sell-off, with the Russell 2000 off by over 25% in a few months, while Brent and WTI prices collapsed by over 40%. Add in the growing angst with the US-China trade war concerns, and it is a recipe for disaster. I\\'ve included a smattering of firms below, all of which have active repurchases or insider buying ongoing. These include Capital Product Partners (CPLP), Star Bulk Carriers (SBLK), Safe Bulkers (SB), Teekay LNG Partners (TGP), Golar LNG Partners (GMLP), Diana Shipping (DSX), and GasLog (GLOG). \\n\\n This selection is down between 17% and 43% since October 1st, underscoring the terrible nature of the current markets. Note these are all firms with strong underlying performance, and repurchases or insider buying. GLOG in particular is finishing a quarter that included all-time record high LNG shipping rates. Yes, the highest rates ever recorded. Product tanker rates are also hitting multi-year highs, but don\\'t tell that to stocks like CPLP or Scorpio Tankers (STNG).\\n Trade War Fears It is undeniable that the US-China trade war has been a major factor hurting shipping stocks, with general market weakness and plunging oil prices simply adding fuel to the bonfire. \\n\\n Image Credit: FinanceTwitter Will the US and China resolve their differences? Although initial commentary between the Trump and Xi meeting was positive, follow-on reports and Tweets from President Trump quickly pushed the market back into a full tailspin. \\n\\n Source: Twitter, @realDonaldTrump Despite the hard-line image, there is proof that President Trump desperately cares about the stock market performance and is open to a deal. Meanwhile, President Xi also desperately needs to come to an agreement to prevent what could otherwise lead to a full-blown recession if unchecked. Chinese stock markets have already fallen over 30%. \\n\\n Image Credit: Jared Szaltis Blogspot There\\'s room for win-win compromise here as the primary US demands of closing the trade deficit (primarily via energy sales) are in China\\'s long-term interests. Additionally, the US wants China to eliminate predatory joint-venture requirements (\"IP theft\") and cut back on state-owned enterprise (\"SOE\") subsidies. Both of these initiatives are also in China\\'s long-term interest.\\n If China reforms its investment policies, they could attract trillions in additional foreign direct investment over the next decade. SOEs are an absolute cancer to developed economies and were a major factor in Japan\\'s multi-decade stagnation. There is evidence that China is making progress here. In a normal market with normal players, this could be a fairly simple deal. However, we are dealing with egos and reputations. Whatever deal emerges, President Trump is likely to trumpet it as a major victory for the US. This places President Xi in an awkward position. Even though the deal might be a long-term win-win, he risks losing face and credibility among the Communist elites. On the other hand, the People\\'s Republic has enjoyed a long-standing mandate, arguably legitimized by their continual delivery of economic improvement. China sits between a rock and a hard place here. Meanwhile, US tariffs could also backfire and halt the surging US economy, as producers are hurt and consumers are slammed. Evidence is already mounting of a slowdown, as per the latest jobs figures. Never mind mounting evidence of a slowdown, as the Federal Reserve went ahead and hiked rates anyways, further adding to market consternation. This adds further pressure to a market concerned with trade-related slowdowns. \\n\\n Image Credit: MR Online Nobody \\'wins\\' a trade war, but lots of people can win in trade deals. It is beyond obvious that President Trump wants a deal and that President Xi doesn\\'t have many options, but some of Trump\\'s advisors are less keen. We are already seeing major signs of progress in China, with over 700 tariffs planned to be reduced or removed, and China has also drafted a law which will take significant strides in protecting foreign-owned intellectual property. These efforts will need to be matched with more substance, but they are still clear positive steps in the right direction.\\n Trade Deal Risk: 1 March Deadline If we push further towards the brink, which now is set for 1 March, without key trade progress, shipping stocks could continue to suffer. There\\'s also potential for sentiment to get much worse, and if the US drives into 25% tariffs for all products, we could definitely see China push much closer to a recession. If high debt balances cannot be managed, the Chinese crash could have global impact. On the positive side, if we see a substantial trade deal, this would likely involve massive Chinese purchases of US crude oil, US LNG, US agricultural products, and perhaps US coal over a multi-decade stretch. This shipping route is one of the longest in the world and such an outcome would certainly lead to shipping rates surging across the board, including several sectors such as tankers and LNG which are already at solid levels even today. Risk vs. Reward Investing in shipping stocks always requires a balance between some macro forecasting for demand while also understanding company-specific prospects such as fleet type, balance sheet strength, and management quality. Now more so than ever, a single major macro event (US/China trade resolutions) has the ability to determine the level of investment results, likely across several years. It remains to be seen what the ultimate US-China outcome will be, but with stocks already sitting at nearly unprecedented lows, the payoff odds are exceptionally skewed in the favor of buyers. Even in current timid markets, supply/demand balances are clearly tight in almost all sectors. A positive trade deal could lead to the strongest bull-surge in shipping stocks we\\'ve witnessed since the mid-2000s, perhaps the strongest on record. Clearly, other owners are feeling the same sentiment. Stock prices in the shipping sector trade with underlying Price-to-NAV (net asset value) multiples, which are based on the real-time valuation of ships. Unlike other sectors such as REITs, which base their NAV on shifting cap rates, shipping companies have liquid markets for most of their underlying assets, with some classes having more than a dozen transactions per week. Underlying ship assets values have remained steady, albeit well below mid-cycle levels in most sectors.\\n Record Lows & Buyers Lining Up The P/NAV for stocks however is at an all-time low across the board. There are several names trading for 50 cents or less per dollar of tangible net assets. These companies trade at a \\'double discount\\' because not only is the stock trading at a 30-60% discount to NAV, the assets which form the NAV itself are also often well below average as well. For a handful of names, it doesn\\'t take more than a soft nudge in the bullish direction to see double, triple, or even quad-bagger returns in a year or two. Why aren\\'t companies repurchasing and insiders buying then?! They are. Just in the past month, we\\'ve seen a dozen actions or active programs.  Diana Shipping (DSX): Tendered 4.2M shares Star Bulk Carriers (SBLK): $50M Repurchase Program Safe Bulkers (SB): 3M Share Repurchase Program Teekay LNG Partners (TGP): $100M Repurchase Program Golden Ocean (GOGL): 6M Share Repurchase Program Golar LNG Partners (GMLP): Doubles $25M to $50M Program Dry Ships (DRYS): Active Repurchase Program GasLog Ltd (GLOG): $50M Repurchase Program  Capital Product Partners (CPLP): Substantial Insider Buying  Scorpio Bulkers (SALT): Active Repurchase Program Scorpio Tankers (STNG): Active Repurchase Program  Navios Maritime Acquisition (NNA): Active Repurchase Program  There are also similar initiatives for European-traded stocks such as MPC Containers (\"MPCC\"). Both BW LPG (OTCPK:BWLLF) and Avance Gas (OTCPK:AVACF) have also seen considerable insider purchases. Conclusion Shipping stocks are sitting near all-time lows in valuations, with P/NAV ratios sitting far below those seen even during 2008-2009 and subsequent panic sell-offs. Meanwhile, underlying rates are strong and repurchase programs and insider buying (both of which are more rare in shipping) are rampant. The best time to buy is when panic is in the air and everyone is cursing the sector. I believe the risk/reward skew is very strong, and I applaud the names above for following through on their value convictions via their repurchases and insider buying activity.\\n Top Buys for 2019\\nAll of the above names have considerable repurchase programs or heavy insider buying. We\\'ve also compiled a \\'Top Idea List for 2019\\' via Value Investor\\'s Edge, which will become public later this week. This list will include six names with stable finances, good management structures, and quality assets which provide a heavy positive skew of risk/reward. The list will also include six names with a more speculative nature, with some direct exposure to market rates, but which also have potential multi-bagger upside.\\nWe are offering a two-week free trial, which also includes access to our high-yield portfolio and exclusive preferred equity and fixed income reviews.

Technically, the ETF held its 200-week simple moving average or its \"reversion to the mean\" at $234.71, which was my call for a short-term rally into year end. A record decline on Christmas Eve followed by record rise of 5.2% on Wednesday should not be viewed as the return of the bull. All year long, I have been providing warnings that 2018 would launch the beginning of a bear market for stocks. Here are the headwinds for 2018 that will continue in 2019. My number one concern is Federal Reserve policy, specifically the unwinding of the balance sheet. In March 2017, the Federal Reserve announced that it would begin to reduce its balance sheet later in the year, and this began in October 2017. The market easily absorbed a drain of $10 billion a month through year-end 2017. The unwinding began 2018 at $20 billion per month through March. In April, the destruction of money increased to $30 billion per month through June, then to $40 billion per month between July and September. In October 2018, the monthly drawdown rose to $50 billion per month. In my opinion, the bear market began after highs were set between Aug. 30 and Oct. 3. This is the main reason that the S&P 500 fell into bear market territory. Stock market warnings intensified during the second half of 2018. The four \"too big to fail\" money center banks and the top five super regional banks were in correction territory and began to fall below their 200-day simple moving averages. You cannot have a bull market for stocks with a bear market for banks.\\n The housing market had been stalling 50% of its potential as the major homebuilder stocks fell into bear market territory. Home prices are too high, and banks continue to be reluctant to lend via the home equity line of credit even as home prices rose to record highs. Investors started to worry about a Trade War given the spread of the tariff situation. The Tax Cut and Jobs Act has left Main Street worried about the implications of losing the tax deduction for state and local income Taxes and property taxes. Record margin debt started to force investors to satisfy margin calls which accelerated the downside. Look for defaults within the global debt bubble. According to data from four sources including the IMF, global debt totals $233 trillion. Non-Financial Corporate Debt totaled $68 trillion. Government Debt totaled $63 trillion. Financial Sector Debt totaled $58 trillion. Household Debt totaled $44 trillion. Main Street USA and small business are being squeezed by the money center and regional banks that have tightened their lending standards beyond the .25% bump for each rate hike by the FOMC. In November, I focused on the formation of \"Death Cross\" patterns. Daily charts formed \"death cross\" patterns as 50-day simple moving averages moved below 200-day simple moving averages, confirming that lower prices lie ahead.  The Russell 2000 confirmed its \"death cross\" on Nov. 13. Dow Transports confirmed its \"death cross\" on Nov. 26. The NASDAQ set its \"death cross\" also on Nov. 26. The S&P 500 formed its \"death cross\" on Dec. 6. The Dow 30 is forming its \"death cross\" on Dec. 19.  The Daily Chart For Spiders \\n\\n Courtesy of MetaStock Xenith The daily chart for SPY shows the ETF below a \"death cross\" since Dec. 6. This pushed the ETF to a new 2018 low of $233.76 on Wednesday before the big day began. SPY tried to stabilize around its 200-day simple moving average and my annual pivot at $276.34 between Oct. 11 and Dec. 4, then the \"death cross\" formed and the crash accelerated. My semiannual pivot at $270.84 tried to hold between Oct. 11 and Dec. 4, but a failed test of this level on Dec. 7 is another warning. The daily chart does not show a level at which to buy, but the weekly chart does.\\n The Weekly Chart For Spiders \\n\\n Courtesy of MetaStock Xenith The weekly chart for the Spiders is now negative but oversold with the ETF below its five-week modified moving average of $260.60 with the 200-week simple moving average or \"reversion to the mean\" at $234.71, which held at the lows on Dec. 24 and Dec. 26. The 12x3x3 weekly slow stochastic reading is projected to decline to 16.95 this week, falling below the oversold threshold at 20.00. My suggested strategy has been to take a short-term long position on weakness to the \"reversion to the mean\" at $234.71. If the rebound continues, reduce holdings at my weekly risky level at $260.76.\\nDisclosure: I/we have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

With analysts so positive on its shares and with the Starbucks\\' (SBUX) investor day presentation largely seen as positive, does the recent price action in its stock price (since that report came out) create a buying opportunity in shares of Starbucks? \\n\\n In this article, I will not discuss the various operations of Starbucks and how each is doing, as you can read many such articles on Seeking Alpha, both pro and con. What I will simply do is a quantitative analysis of Starbucks’ results on Main Street and then relate them to what an investor should do on Wall Street, using zero emotion. It will also be interesting to see how Starbucks will be affected by this quarter’s tumbling stock market. Will investors finally get a chance to get Starbucks shares at a bargain price? Let us now go and analyze Starbucks and find out what our Friedrich algorithm has to say about all this. Main Street vs. Wall Street In analyzing Starbucks, we will present some unique ratios that our Friedrich Investing System uses and will present a real-time quantitative analysis that will demonstrate the power of free cash flow in the investment process. In doing so, we will also teach everyone how to analyze one\\'s portfolio holdings on Main Street vs. Wall Street. At the same time, we will explain how the methodology involved in this analysis came about. Main Street is where Starbucks operates and Wall Street is where its shares trade. The Starbucks shares that one can purchase on Wall Street are traded publicly on exchanges and the company has little control over how each share will trade. Starbucks is required to release its earnings reports each quarter and, from time to time, it also provides press releases to its shareholders (and the general public) giving updates on how its operations are doing on Main Street.\\n Main Street is where Starbucks invests in its own operations and sells to its customers. How well the CEO of Starbucks and its management do in selling those products determines how profitable the company will be. Wall Street then reacts based on the success or failure of management to meet its goals. Main Street and Wall Street are thus interlinked, but because anyone with a computer (or even just a smart phone), an internet connection, and a brokerage account can buy or sell any stock at any time, expertise is not a requirement in order to invest on Wall Street. This results in Wall Street being a very dangerous place to operate as many investors tend to invest through emotion or follow the herd in and out of stocks. During bull markets, investors feel like they can do no wrong as \"the rising tide lifts all boats.\" But when a bear market suddenly shows up, these same investors tend to panic and like lemmings stampede over the cliff. Thus, we have the classic case of \"greed vs. panic.\" Creation of the Friedrich Algorithm Having noticed this problem some 35 years ago, I spent the last three decades building an algorithm called Friedrich. Our algorithm was designed to assist all investors (both Pro and Novice alike) and give them the ability to quickly compare a company\\'s Main Street operations, to its Wall Street valuation (Overbought or Oversold condition). Friedrich can do this on an individual company basis or assist users in analyzing an entire index like the S&P 500, an ETF, Mutual Fund, or individual portfolio with the use of our Portfolio Analyzer. I recently did so when I compared Apple ( AAPL) to the S&P 500 Index (SPY) Apple Vs. The S&P 500: Which Is The Better Investment? Many years ago, while reading Berkshire Hathaway\\'s ( BRK.A) ( BRK.B) 1986 letter to shareholders, I discovered a ratio, which Mr. Buffett called \"Owner Earnings,\" or what we may consider to be Mr. Buffett\\'s version of FCF, or \"Free Cash Flow.\" To my amazement, in that little footnote, Mr. Buffett explained how to use it and basically states that it is one of the key ratios that he and Charlie Munger used in analyzing stocks. In that article, he defined the term \"owner earnings\" as the cash that is generated by the company\\'s business operations.\\n \"[Owner earnings] represent [A] reported earnings plus [B] depreciation, depletion, amortization, and certain other non-cash charges… less [C] the average annual amount of capitalized expenditures for plant and equipment, etc. that the business requires to fully maintain its long-term competitive position and its unit volume.\" I have used the free cash flow ratio for decades, using data from the Value Line Investment Survey, whose founder was Arnold Bernhard. Mr. Bernhard was a big fan of free cash flow and probably introduced it sooner than Mr. Buffett did. I know this as I was able to calculate the FCF ratio using old Value Line sheets for my 60-year backtest of the DJIA from 1950 to 2009. The backtest mentioned above demonstrated that if one can purchase a company whose shares are selling for 15 (or less) times its Price to Free Cash Flow Ratio, that the probability of success will dramatically increase in most cases. I have renamed the ratio the Bernhard Buffett Free Cash Flow ratio in honor of both men. The following is how that ratio is calculated. Wall Street Analysis Price to Bernhard Buffett Free Cash Flow Ratio = Sherlock Debt Divisor / [(net income per share + depreciation per share) - (capital spending per diluted share)] Sherlock Debt Divisor = Market Price Per Share - ((Working Capital - Long-Term Debt)/Diluted Shares Outstanding)) The above are the ratios I use when analyzing a stock on Wall Street, and below are the ratios I use when analyzing a stock on Main Street. Main Street Analysis FROIC means \"Free Cash Flow Return on Invested Capital\" Forward Free Cash Flow = [((Net Income + Depreciation) (1+ % Revenue Growth rate)) - (Capital Spending)] FROIC = (Forward Free Cash Flow)/(Long-Term Debt + Shareholders\\' Equity) The FROIC ratio tells us how much forward free cash flow we can expect the company to generate on Main Street relative to how much total capital it has employed. So, if a company invests $100 in total capital on Main Street and generates $20 in forward free cash flow it, therefore, has a FROIC of 20%, which we consider excellent. This is just one of the key ratios (66 in total) that we use to identify how a company is performing on Main Street, as it is our belief that if a company is making a killing on Main Street, Wall Street will eventually take notice.\\n So, let us begin our analysis and at the same time try to teach everyone how to do a similar analysis on one\\'s own portfolio. In analyzing Starbucks’ Price to Bernhard Buffett FCF ratio, we must first adjust Starbucks’ Wall Street Price to account for its debt using our Sherlock Debt Divisor. Below is a detailed definition of that ratio and how we use it. Sherlock Debt Divisor A major concern that I have these days in analyzing companies is the debt burden relative to its operations and whether management is abusing this situation by taking on more debt than it requires. Debt, when used wisely, allows for what is called leverage, and leverage can be extremely beneficial within certain parameters. On the other side of the coin, the use of debt can also be excessive and put a company\\'s future in jeopardy. So, what I have done to determine if a company\\'s debt policy is beneficial or abusive is to create the Sherlock Debt Divisor. What the Divisor does is punish companies that use debt unwisely and rewards those who successfully use debt as leverage. How do I do this? Well, I take a company\\'s working capital and subtract its long-term debt. If a company has a lot more working capital than long-term debt I reward it but punish those whose long-term debt exceeds its working capital. So, if this result is higher than the current stock market price, then leverage is being used and the more leveraged a company is, the worse the results of this ratio will be and the less attractive its stock will be as an investment. Thus, having successfully defined the Sherlock Debt Divisor, we need the following four bits of financial data in order to calculate it for Starbucks TTM (trailing twelve months) is as close to real-time data as we can get, based on when each company reports. The current analysis is taken from the Starbucks’ September 30, 2018 filing with the SEC (except the Market Price per share). Market Price Per Share = $61.92 Working Capital = Total Current Assets - Total Current Liabilities\\n Total Current Assets = $12,494,200,000 Total Current Liabilities = $5,684,200,000 Working Capital = $6,810,000,000 Long-Term Debt = $9,090,200,000 Diluted Shares Outstanding = 1,349,000,000 Sherlock Debt Divisor = Market Price Per Share - ((Working Capital - Long-Term Debt)/ (Diluted Shares Outstanding)) Sherlock Debt Divisor = $61.92 - ((6,810,000,000 - $9,090,200,000)/ 1,349,000,000)) Sherlock Debt Divisor = $61.92 - ($-1.69) = $63.61 Since Starbucks has more Long-Term Debt vs. Working Capital, we, therefore, must punish it and use the new $63.61 as our new numerator in all our calculations. Wall Street Analysis of Starbucks Price to Bernhard Buffett FCF Ratio = Sherlock Debt Divisor/[(net income per share + depreciation per share) - (capital spending per diluted share)] Sherlock Debt Divisor = $63.61 Net Income per diluted share = $4,518,300,000/1,349,000,000 = $3.35 Depreciation per diluted share = $1,305,900,000/1,349,000,000 = $0.97 Capital Spending per diluted share = $-1,976,400,000/1,349,000,000 = $-1.47 $3.35 + $0.97 - $1.47 = $2.85 Price to Bernhard Buffett Free Cash Flow Ratio = $63.61/$2.85 = 22.32 Now, if one goes to our FRIEDRICH LEGEND (on what is considered a good or bad result), you will notice that our result of 22.32 is considered average, while anything under 15 is considered excellent. We last ran our data file for Starbucks on December 26, 2018, and our Friedrich Algorithm gave a recommendation to our subscribers that Starbucks is a \" Strong Hold\" as our Friedrich Data File and Chart below shows. There you will also find the last 10 years of Starbucks’ Price to Bernhard Buffett Free Cash Flow results. \\n\\n \\n\\n\\n Main Street Analysis of Starbucks Now that we have taught everyone how to calculate our Price to Bernhard Buffett Free Cash Flow ratio, let us now move on and teach everyone how to calculate our FROIC ratio. This is how we calculate it: FROIC means \"Free Cash Flow Return on Invested Capital\" Forward Free Cash Flow = [((Net Income + Depreciation) (1+ % Revenue Growth rate)) - (Capital Spending)] FROIC = (Forward Free Cash Flow)/(Long-Term Debt + Shareholders\\' Equity) Net Income per diluted share = $4,518,300,000/1,349,000,000 = $3.35 Depreciation per diluted share = $1,305,900,000/1,349,000,000 = $0.97 Capital Spending per diluted share = $-1,976,400,000/1,349,000,000 = $-1.47 $3.35 + $0.97 - $1.47 = $2.85 Revenue Growth Rate TTM = 0% (Is zero because September 30, 2018 was also Starbucks’ fiscal year end so you can also use the results for fiscal year end 2018 as your guide on what to do) [(($3.35 + $0.97) (100%)) – 1.47 =$2.85 Long-Term Debt = $9,090,200,000 Shareholders Equity = $1,169,500,000 Diluted Shares Outstanding = 1,349,000,000 FROIC = (Forward Free Cash Flow)/ (Long-Term Debt + Shareholders\\' Equity) $2.85/$7.61 =37.45% FROIC = 37.45% Now, if one goes to my FRIEDRICH LEGEND again (on what is considered a good or bad result), you will notice that our result of 37.45% is considered excellent and tells us that Starbucks produces $37.45 in forward free cash flow for every $100 it invests in total capital employed on Main Street . On Main Street, Starbucks is doing very well, while on Wall Street it is considered a strong hold. What To Do? Going forward, Friedrich considers Starbucks a strong hold right now. Starbucks only hit its Friedrich Bargain Price once in its history and that was in July 2018. You can see what happens when a high quality company like Starbucks has its share price hit our Friedrich Bargain Price, by going to the chart below: \\n\\n\\n That clearly could have been the bottom for its shares, unless the current Bear Market in stocks were to continue. Always remember though what Peter Lynch wrote in a 2015 Worth Magazine article: “what makes stocks valuable in the long run isn’t the market. It’s the profitability of the shares in the companies you own. Corporations become more valuable and sooner or later, their shares will sell for a higher price.” In conclusion, it is my belief that free cash flow analysis is the ultimate tool when analyzing companies, and my hope is that you may add these ratios to your own investor toolbox in order to help you in your own due diligence.

Why?', 'include': ['Navios Maritime Acquisition Corporation (NNA)'], 'time': '2018-12-27T13:48:52Z', 'author': 'Morningsidepark', 'about': ['<span id=\"about_primary_stocks\"><a href=\"/symbol/NNA\" title=\"Navios Maritime Acquisition Corporation\" sasource=\"article_primary_about\">Navios Maritime Acquisition Corporation (NNA)</a></span>'], 'theme': ['<div class=\"a-themes\"></div>'], 'summary': ['NNA has plummeted 43.1% in the eight trading days since closing the merger (buy-in) of NAP on December 13th.The selloff has coincided with the general market selloff, plummeting oil prices, and the beginning of a seasonal rollover in product tanker rates.Despite a 5% rally in the stock market and almost 6% rally in oil prices on December 26th, NNA traded down 10% on its heaviest volume since the merger close.This is a clear sign that the selloff has also been exacerbated by tax selling as NNA shareholders and former NAP shareholders realize losses after a dismal year.'], 'article': ['Navios Maritime Acquisition Corporation (NYSE:NNA) is a financially troubled company that owns a fleet of VLCC crude tankers and LR and MR product tankers. It is a 44.2% owned subsidiary of Navios Maritime Holdings, Inc. (NYSE:NM), and an affiliate of Navios Maritime Partners LP (NYSE:NMM) and its subsidiary Navios Maritime Containers LP (NMCI). It is an affiliate and joint venture partner in Navios Europe I and II. Background NNA recently completed a merger, more properly a buy-in of the minority common units, of Navios Maritime Midstream Partners LP (NAP). The merger is discussed at length in these three articles that should be read as a primer to this article.  \"Vote Is In, Common Stock Only for NAP Acquisition\" \"NAP Acquisition Deep Dive - Part I\" \"NAP Acquisition Deep Dive - Part II\"  There are also a series of articles that examine NNA\\'s financial woes in depth. The merger closed on December 13th, and in the eight trading days subsequent to that date, NNA has plummeted more than 43.1%. The following table provides the trading summary for those days. Please note that NNA has approximately 9.85 million shares trading post a 1-for-15 reverse split and post the closing of the merger with NAP. Approximately 5.5 million of those shares are owned by parties other than NNA. Within the context of this level of third-party ownership, the volume traded post-merger has been relatively light.    Date Open High Low Close Volume Change %   12/26/18 $3.85 $3.85 $3.36 $3.55 217,919 -10.1%   12/24/18 $4.25 $4.25 $3.95 $3.95 54,019 -7.7%   12/21/18 $4.59 $4.64 $4.20 $4.28 90,768 -8.9%   12/20/18 $5.21 $5.34 $4.60 $4.70 160,830 -12.3%   12/19/18 $5.32 $5.55 $5.18 $5.36 83,855 0.0%   12/18/18 $5.38 $5.53 $5.34 $5.36 61,315 -3.4%   12/17/18 $5.92 $5.94 $5.53 $5.55 121,789 -7.8%   12/14/18 $6.06 $6.22 $5.96 $6.02 75,619 -3.5%   Total Volume         866,114     Total volume over the eight trading days ending December 26th of 866,114 equals approximately 15.76% of the float. NNA and NAP Price Performance The price performance of all the Navios companies during Q4 2018 has been dismal. NM was the worst performer until announcing a tender for its outstanding Series G and H Preferreds after the close on December 21st. NNA has now usurped that honor as it continued to plummet 10% on December 26th, despite a 5% rally in the market. \\n\\nNNA data by YCharts NNA\\'s full-year performance is even worse! \\n\\nNNA data by YCharts Although not listed in the above graph, NAP had an equally dismal year due to slashing its common unit distribution. The holders of both NNA and NAP both had significant losses that could be realized for tax purposes. S&P Selloff The broader market also suffered a severe selloff from the peaks in August, driven by interest rate concerns, attacks on the Fed by the Trump administration, attacks on trade agreements, threats of tariffs, and concerns of a slowing worldwide economy. \\n\\n^SPX data by YCharts As illustrated in the graph above, the US markets, as represented by the S&P 500 and the NASDAQ Composite, were both outperforming world markets until October. The concerns listed above finally resulted in the US markets cracking. The most recent crescendo of selling came after the S&P 500 experienced a death cross with the 50-DMA crossing over the 200-DMA. Trading momentum has been to the downside.\\n Oil Selloff Despite surging over 8% on December 26th, crude oil is still down almost 40% from its highs in October. Oversupply has received much of the blame, but concerns over a slowdown in growth have also been a factor. The selloff in oil slammed energy stocks as the following graph of XLE illustrates. \\n\\nXLE data by YCharts The almost 30% plunge in energy stocks since early October also had a deleterious effect on the high-yield markets as explained by my friends at C.J. Lawrence in a their market brief today. The collapse in crude oil prices finally reversed today and was the catalyst for the rally. Oil has been selling off sharply since the end of October, weighing on the credit markets. The oil industry has been financing much of its capital expenditure in the high yield bond market. December was the first month where there was zero issuance of high yield debt since the 2008 credit crisis, which is quite abnormal. Chairman Powell only added fuel to the credit market fire when he communicated being on auto pilot for 2 more rate increases in 2019. The collapse in oil prices and the general energy stock selloff also took down the tanker stocks. \\n\\nNNA data by YCharts Product Tanker Rates After a very robust spike in rates during Q4 2018, as illustrated in the graphs included in this Weber Tanker Weekly Report, clean product tanker indices began their seasonal rollover in late December. Q1 tends to be a weak period for tanker rates, particularly at the back end, so a sustained decline in rates will pressure stocks, like NNA, that have a significant exposure to LRs and MRs.\\n The Perfect Storm NNA is a financially troubled company due to its excessive leverage and severe liquidity constraints. As detailed in the referenced articles, it was significantly cash flow negative during 2018 and was forced to sell assets in order to plug its liquidity shortfalls during the year. The buy-in of NAP was designed to provide another shot of cash to possibly see NNA through its Q2 2019 coupon payments on its notes. NNA\\'s stock price had been battered throughout 2018, but it collapsed post-merger because it was being buffeted by a perfect storm of negative market forces.  Plummeting oil prices. Rollover in product tanker rates. General market selloff. Selling by NAP unitholders post the execution of the merger. Tax selling by both NNA and former NAP unitholders.  NNA was down 79% YTD. It had executed a massive 1-for-15 reverse stock split. The energy markets were in a funk. Prospects for 2019 looked grim. It is no surprise that tax selling is occurring and that it is having an outsized impact on NNA\\'s stock. The stock is plunging because there are no marginal buyers. The lack of marginal buyers is evidenced by the light volume and the steep daily price drops. Five of the eight trading days saw price declines in excess of 7%. Two of those days experienced declines in excess of 10%. Illiquid Stock NNA is a microcap stock (approximately $35 million) in a currently out-of-favor sector with motivated tax sellers, a parent in financial extremis, and no sponsorship (with good reason) amongst research analysts. As noted above, only 15.8% of the float has traded since the merger closed. The price decline in the last eight days increases the motivation to sell for tax purposes, and it is likely that the stock will continue to experience pricing pressure the remainder of this week. The only saving graces would be an even more explosive rally in the general market and in the price of oil (I am skeptical on both). Barring those two events, the stock will continue to trade down until the new year.\\n Conclusion In an article published December 12th, I wrote this: All NAP unitholders will become common stockholders of NNA at the close of the Merger. The Merger was a clever move by NNA. It will be a temporary source of funds that likely will allow NNA to survive through Q2 of 2019 (if the recent spike in MR and LR rates carries through to year-end). I continue to expect NNA to decline significantly, defined as 60 to 80% from current price levels, by June 30th, 2019. NNA closed at $6.45 on December 12th. At a $3.55 close on December 26th, it is down 45% since the article. There is still room for it to go lower from here.\\nDisclosure: I/we have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

Approximately 2/3 of the float of the stock is effectively \"locked up.\"'], 'article': ['Introduction Summer Infant (SUMR), headquartered in Woonsocket, Rhode Island, was originally founded in 1985, and has traded on the Nasdaq since 2007. The company designs, markets, and distributes branded infant and juvenile health, safety, and wellness products. It markets proprietary products in various categories, including nursery audio or video monitors, safety gates, durable bath products, bed rails, infant thermometers, related health and safety products, booster and potty seats, cribs, baby gear, bouncers, feeding items, and swaddling blankets. The top 7 customers represented 77% of sales in 2017, with Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and the bankrupt Toys R Us the largest at 25% and 17%, respectively. Additional noteworthy customers include Walmart (NYSE:WMT), Target (NYSE:TGT), Buy Buy Baby, Home Depot (NYSE:HD), and Lowe\\'s (NYSE:LOW). Major competitors include Motorola, Munchkin, GB, Graco, Chicco, Fisher-Price, Vtech, and Aden & Anais. \\n\\n\\n The company has relatively high debt and, despite the arrival of a highly talented management team over the last few years, SUMR had been hit by the double whammy of litigation expenses with prior management in 2015 and 2016, and then the bankruptcy and liquidation of its second largest customer, Toys R Us, in 2017 and 2018. These two events caused significant net losses, that masked an otherwise stable EBITDA, and underlying improvement in working capital management, cost containment, new product development, and the core business generally, that the executive team has been implementing. In more recent times, the closing of a new and expanded credit deal on June 28th (not long after the \"final hit\" from the TRU liquidation) represented a remarkable turn of events for the company. It means SUMR now has ample runway to implement its plans for margin and sales growth, expanded product placement both domestically and internationally, enhanced brand image, and the establishment of Summer Infant as an increasingly dominant and valuable brand. Importantly, this author believes SUMR is at a dramatic inflection point in its turnaround. The result will be not only significant near term stock price appreciation, but the potential for 3-5 year price appreciation of upwards of 5-10x the current price in a salubrious \"growth and de-levering\" scenario. Alternatively, the company could become an eventual acquisition candidate for a larger strategic player. A Highly Disciplined Board and Management Team Came In During the 2014-2016 Period and Started Fixing Summer Infant, Focusing the Company Strategy, and Improving Overall Operations Previously, the company had suffered a dizzying revolving door of management changes that witnessed SUMR having 4 different CEOs over a 2 1/2 year period from February 2014 through July 2016. In addition, Since May of 2015, six out of seven board seats have turned over. CFO Bill Mote (who just left the company a month ago) arrived in November 2014. CEO Mark Messner arrived in July 2016. Chief Product Officer Art Gehr was appointed in December 2016. And Kory Pomon was appointed VP of International Sales in December 2017. Each of these last three men has lengthy 20+ year records in the baby products industry, with each having previously worked at Graco, a highly respected infant products marketer and division of Newell Brands. (Messner held the title of \"Global Products Manager\" at Graco from 2001 to 2003, and is also the former CEO of the long established, high-end Italian juvenile products maker, Chicco.) The new management has been involved in an array of endeavors to improve SUMR, from cost reductions and squeezing out significant working capital efficiencies on one hand, to new product development, brand enhancement, and sales and margin growth initiatives, on the other. The company has realized a number of successes in this regard, including a new line of video monitors and gates introduced in fiscal 2017, and the implementation in 2018 of a three-year plan to support growth of direct-to-consumer sales. (These sales, which already comprise nearly 50% of total sales, are higher margin.) In addition, the company is working to boost its international sales (the CEO\\'s prior experience at Chicco\\'s is invaluable in this regard). Finally, SUMR has terminated its relationship with upwards of 200 low quality distributors who had a penchant for discounting, and instituted a minimum advertised price (MAP) policy, in order to systematically maintain a rigorous pricing discipline, which solidifies brand value, and keeps its brick and mortar customers happy. (This pays dividends for SUMR, in that it helps the company achieve stable and reliable revenue streams, as brick and mortar customers do not have to fear being undercut.)\\n The Company Realized Steady Adjusted EBITDA from 2015 through 2017, and an Improved Leverage Ratio The company realized adjusted EBITDA of $9.7 million in 2015, $10.6 million in 2016, and $10.3 million in 2017, showing the relative stability of the core business\\'s normalized cash flows. Meanwhile, the bank leverage ratio (net debt divided by trailing 12 month adjusted EBITDA) improved from 5.5x at the year end 2015, to 5.1x at year end 2016, to 4.7x at year end 2017. (The company had $57.4 million of net debt at year end 2014, $52.7 million at year end 2015, $45.9 million at year end 2016, and $47.4 million at year end 2017.) The improved leverage ratio was the accomplishment of [now former] CFO Bill Mote, who, since having arrived in 2014, increased the direct import of product 4x over (product shipped directly from the factory in China to the retail store in the U.S.), as well as boosting drop shipped product (direct from the company warehouse to the end customer). These actions dramatically reduced the need to warehouse product, allowing the company to reduce its inventories. Mote also squeezed payables and receivables, materially reducing working capital needs, as well as carefully and methodically trimming costs with a fine tooth comb. (Importantly, if it were not for Mote\\'s efforts, this author believes that SUMR would have likely been bankrupted by now.) Unfortunately, the Above Noted Improvements were Offset by Declining Sales, by Huge Legal Fees Incurred in a Fight With Prior Management, as well as Write-Offs from the TRU Bankruptcy, Resulting in Bottom Line Net Losses The company realized sales of $205.5 million in 2015, declining to $194 million in 2016, and $190 million in 2017. The cause of the 2016 decline was primarily due to a bank approved inventory reduction plan executed in 2015, that was not repeated in 2016. The cause of the decline in 2017 was a $6 million decline in sales to TRU, as well as an overall reduction of $12 million in monitor sales that year (although offset by a $10.5 million increase in safety product sales), with the flagship monitor product becoming obsolete, owing to technological advances and significant competition. The company has since fully rolled out, earlier this year, its new, cutting-edge, Baby Pixel and Glimpse Digital Video premium priced monitors, the latter of which features remote digital zoom, cutting-edge night vision, a voice activated video screen wake up, a soft glow camera night light, and is expandable to up to 4 cameras for keeping an eye on multiple children in several rooms. (The CEO referred to the Baby Pixel\\'s \"strong market acceptance\" in the company\\'s Q2 earnings conference call.)\\n On the cost side, the company suffered a whopping $6.6 million of expenses in 2015, and $2.4 million in 2016, for litigation and severance with prior management, in a brutal battle in which the board accused prior management of stealing company trade secrets. That litigation was eventually settled by both parties, but not before substantial damage (and distraction) had been visited upon the company. In addition, in 2015, the company also suffered $3 million in expenses for the write down of inventory being liquidated (including exiting the furniture category). In 2017, with the Toys R Us bankruptcy filing in September, there was a $1.5 million write-off of bad TRU debt, as well as a $1.7 million charge related to the Trump Tax Act. Finally, in 2018, the worst thing possible happened, the total liquidation of TRU, which created an additional $2.3 million bad debt charge early that year. The net effect of all of the above is that the company incurred net losses of $250,000, $8.7 million, $4.3 million, and $2.2 million in fiscal 2014, 2015, 2016, and 2017, respectively. The Net Losses from 2014 to 2017, Combined with the Additional Hit from TRU\\'s Liquidation in Early 2018, Created Solvency Fears and Sent the Stock Cratering to a 10 Year Low in April 2018 The TRU losses (TRU represented 17% of SUMR\\'s sales in 2017) made the already constricted balance sheet more precarious, and spooked the Street. The company had already been bumping up against its credit limits for a good while and was being managed for working capital, with over-advances on the working capital line increasingly the norm. By April of 2018, the market feared the TRU liquidation would bankrupt the Company, and the stock suffered a sickening swoon that sent it plummeting to as low as 72 cents (after having traded as high as $2.25 in 2017 and $4.50 back in 2014). The Company has been very Proactive and has Made Material Cost Reductions, Setting Itself up for a Turnaround The company announced, in response to the TRU liquidation (and permanent loss of a 17% of sales customer), that it was making staff reductions and taking other actions in order to generate savings of approximately $1.6 million annually. This was incremental to $700,000 in annual savings from a previously announced $1 million capital project involving realigning of the California warehouse facility (a project that was completed ahead of schedule, this past summer). The net savings of these two actions are a very material $2.3 million annually; this, at a time when the company is expected to grow both its sales and margins in 2019. Combined, these cost reductions and anticipation of higher sales and margins in 2019 are setting up the company for a dramatic improvement in its financial results in the near to intermediate term.\\n Remarkably, Despite the Net Losses and TRU Bankruptcy Hit, the Company was Able to Obtain a new Credit Deal, which Expanded Overall Liquidity by an Additional $15 Million, and Provided the Company with the Runway Needed to Execute on its Growth Plans While the Street may have been oblivious to the internal improvements going on within the company, its bankers certainly were not. After the unexpected TRU liquidation announcement, SUMR initially obtained an amendment on April 24th, which waived violations caused by the additional TRU receivables write-downs, but raised the interest rate by 200 basis points. Then, in a watershed event, on May 30th, the company obtained a new financing commitment for a $65 million LIBOR plus 1.75-2.00% line of credit from Bank of America (its prior lender) and a $17.5 million LIBOR plus 9.0% term loan from Pathlight Capital, which closed in mid June of 2018. This arrangement provided the company with $15 million of incremental borrowing capacity. The net effect was that the company, in one fell swoop, went from being over-advanced $2 million, to suddenly having $13 million in additional availability! In addition, the onerous 20% annual amortization requirement was significantly scaled back, and the leverage covenant was completely eliminated, replaced solely by a 1x fixed charge coverage ratio requirement (a covenant the company, at currently 2x, very comfortably meets). Importantly, it is clear that the reason for this improved bank deal was that it reflected lender confidence in management\\'s turnaround plans, including bankers\\' faith in the company\\'s cost reduction program, in the strength of the new product pipeline, and in the other initiatives designed to boost both sales and gross margins. For equity holder purposes, the new credit deal is noteworthy in that it not only eliminates near term solvency risk, but takes any notion of bankruptcy off the table. I believe the stock price doesn\\'t fully account for this dramatic inflection in the company\\'s fortunes, where the lenders are clearly aware that the TRU situation is \"water under the dam,\" and that the internals of SUMR are substantially stronger than meets the eye.\\n While the stock initially Soared from 72 cents to $1.98, Partly in Response to the New Credit Deal, it has since Retraced, Dropping to 80 cents, A Victim of The Recent Market Decline, and the Arbitrary Punishment Meted out to Leveraged Micro-Caps. Yet, the Company\\'s Most Recent Earnings Release and Conference Call Clearly Reveal that the Turnaround is at Hand. For Q3 2018, the company reported $43.8 million in sales, versus $43.1 million in the year ago quarter. Importantly, SUMR realized $5.1 million in sales in Q3 2017 to TRU that were not repeated in 2018. While there is no doubt that some of these lost TRU sales shifted to other outlets in Q3 2018, for the sake of argument, if TRU had not gone out of business, and the company had realized the same $5.1 million of sales to TRU in Q3 2018, its total sales would have been up roughly 14% in Q3 2018, versus the year ago quarter. Gross margins were down to 31.1% from 31.6% in the year ago quarter, but that was owing to the Amazon Prime Day sales promotion, as well as the effects of one-time closeout sales related to inventory associated with the TRU liquidation. Meanwhile, the company reported that its e-commerce business, in total, now represented nearly 50% of total sales. In the Q3 conference call transcript, the CEO indicated \"we are rather upbeat about the outlook for Q4,\" with the company \"shipping a host of fresh products this quarter,\" including placing gates at Lowe\\'s (the recent launch of gates at Target in May added \"an entirely new sales channel to one of our best product categories,\" a category in which the company believes it is the North American leader), and \"gaining additional shelf space across nearly our entire product portfolio [and] winning incremental placement in stores.\" Regarding sales to major brick and mortar retailers like Walmart, Target, and Lowe\\'s the CEO said SUMR expects \"double digit increases with many of these channel partners this year, and expect similar gains going forward.\" Additionally, \"we\\'re taking a focused approach to product distribution to protect pricing, build brand reputation, and strengthen our connection with consumers.\" Finally, \"With the upcoming launch of the Born Free brand next year and our plethora of new products hitting the market, we\\'re positioned for higher operating performance headed into 2019 (emphasis mine).\" The CFO indicated, \"We remain optimistic about overall order trends for the company and believe SUMR is well positioned for top line expansion in 2019.\" The CEO returned to say \"We\\'re feeling pretty good about the incremental placements we\\'ve gotten. As we go into 2019, we have a host of new products that are setting in the 4th quarter and feel really positive about those new placements. And Born Free [the relaunch of this brand from a feeding brand to a gear brand] will help us introduce a higher gross margin product to our mix.\" Finally, the CEO\\'s closing comment was, \"We look forward to reconnecting with you in the fourth quarter and look forward to a good one.\" Management is clearly very optimistic about the 4th quarter, and beyond.\\n The Departure of the Former CFO may Actually be a Good Sign, Reflecting the Company\\'s Transition to the Status of a Bonafide Growth Story, and No Longer Needing a \"Crisis Manager\" The departure of CFO Bill Mote a month ago, and return of former CFO Paul Francese reflects a scenario where the work of cost cutting, shrinking, aggressively managing working capital, and negotiating a new bank deal by a highly skilled \"crisis manager\" is done. As such, the CEO decided to put in a new CFO whose skillset coincides with the more \"aspirational\" growth phase that the company is now in. This strategy and vision is best reflected in a comment the CEO made in the company\\'s Q1 conference call: \"I don\\'t want to get ahead of myself here, suffice it to say, we\\'re excited about the steps we\\'ve already taken to enact what we\\'re calling a house of brands strategy, a strategy to be leaders in certain categories through the use of innovative product development and effective brand management. It\\'s a time of big change here as we shift into the growth mode and the future looks more positive every day. We have a keen understanding of our market segments and sub-segments and are much better due to extensive consumer research. And we also know how to prevent our products from over-saturating certain channels and driving down prices.\" Insiders, Including CEO Mark Messner, and 37% Holder Wynnefield Capital, Have Been Buying SUMR Stock in the Open Market in Recent Days, and for the Last Couple Years. Along With Other Large Holders, Roughly 2/3 of the Public Float is Now \"Locked Up.\" CEO Mark Messner has made consistent open market purchases of SUMR stock. Significantly, he bought 10,000 shares at $1.75 on 5/10/17, 16,500 at $1.35 on 3/6/18, 5,850 on 5/7/18 at 83 cents, 5,150 on 5/10/18 at 93 cents, 5,000 on 9/10/18 at $1.73, and 9,900 shares on 11/29-11/30/18 at $1.01. During this time period, he has increased his overall position substantially, from 95,000 shares, to 167,900 shares (includes a 20,000 restricted stock grant). During this same time period, at least 4 other directors, and the new CFO, bought shares in the open market. (Fair disclosure: The former CFO had sold stock in the open market, in September 2018, at $1.63 and $1.79.)\\n The company\\'s largest shareholder is hedge fund Wynnefield Capital, with 37% ownership. The fund, with $240 million under management, is run by legendary micro cap value investor Nelson Obus, and has owned SUMR stock for at least a decade, gradually increasing its ownership stake over time. Wynnefield had been buying the stock throughout 2017, paying as high as the $1.80s, but eventually hit its 35% ownership cap, a restriction of SUMR\\'s bank credit agreement. Intriguingly, in a move little noticed on the Street, on March 1st, 2018, SUMR blandly announced in an 8-K filing that it had quietly modified its bank credit agreement to allow Wynnefield to raise its ownership to as high as 45%. Since then, the firm has been ramping up its buying, as SUMR\\'s turnaround has begun to increasingly take hold. Wynnefield bought an eyebrow-raising 238,000 shares on 5/7/18 at 80 cents, 30,000 on 5/31/18 at $1.22, and has stepped in, of late, to support the stock in its recent swoon, purchasing 6,200 at $1.04 on 11/30/18, 23,800 at $1.00 on 12/3/18, 5,000 at $1 on 12/6/18, and 29,754 at $.94 on 12/14/18. The company\\'s largest shareholders consist of Wynnefield at 37%, former longtime CEO Jason Macari at 16%, this author at 4.7%, current and former insiders at about 4.0%, the State of New Jersey Common Pension Fund at 2.9%, and Renaissance Technologies at 2.6%. Together, these shareholders comprise 67% ownership, leaving a relatively tight float of only 6.25 million shares remaining outstanding. With ownership this concentrated, the stock has shown in the past that it can and will move quickly, on any substantive upturn in demand from the market place. The Company has been Waylaid by Exogenous Circumstances, that have Artificially Depressed the Stock Price, Enhancing the Opportunity First of all, the company was removed from the Russell microcap index at the end of May, which created forced (and arbitrary) selling pressure. Secondly, the company is only followed by one boutique firm on the Street, Roth Capital Partners. Third, the company is under-followed in the Seeking Alpha community, with no SA articles written on the company since February 9, 2016. Fourth, the obsolescence of its prior monitor (and resulting discounting) was bad for the company. Monitors have been a flagship product which historically advantaged SUMR. While the glory days of monitors are over, the fact that the company has released a completely revamped monitor product, that is highly differentiated, with many value added features, will allow the company to again earn better margins on this mainstay offering. Fifth, the dramatic rise and decline of the stock, over the last 6 months, casts a pall on SUMR and sows unnecessary and unreasonable doubt amongst investors in the \"authenticity\" of the company\\'s turnaround. Finally, I have little doubt that the company is suffering from tax loss selling, especially for buyers who chased the stock this past summer, in its run up to $1.98. (The short term opportunity would be for a \"January Effect\" rally... and a continuation of any rally with the release of Q4 results in February.)\\n Valuation and Price Targets Owing to the company\\'s levered status, and fact it effectively trades like an option, valuing Summer Infant in any near term turnaround scenario is both art and science. One methodology would be to look at the predominant trading range for the stock from roughly mid 2015 through late 2017. These were not particularly good times for the company, so if SUMR can achieve a strengthening operating profile in 2019, as expected, there is every reason to believe it can at least get back to the price range during the aforementioned time period. That range was generally $1.50-2.25, and that is one way to set a target range for the stock over the next 6-12 months, keeping in mind that the near term guidance from management is quite favorable. Another way to value the company is to look at the target EBITDA level in the proxy statement from this past March (which is provided for the purposes of determining management bonuses). Management would be rewarded with a target EBITDA level of $13 million. That is a 30% increase from the $10 million level of adjusted EBITDA achieved in each of the years 2015 through 2017. Achieving this level of EBITDA would therefore seem to easily validate the above $1.50-2.25 price target range (since a 30% increase in EBITDA should justify an even higher stock price than the 2015-2017 range). Moreover, if the company achieved $13 million in EBITDA, and were valued on an EV/EBITDA basis of 6.0x, that would value the company at $78 million, less $40 million in net debt (I assume a $4 million debt paydown during the year), would be a valuation of $38 million, which, on 18.8 million shares out, would convert to a stock price of just over $2. Over the longer term, assuming the company is able to boost its EBITDA margins to 7-8%, on an eventual $250 million sales level in 3 years, that would earn the company $17.5-20.0 million in EBITDA. Assuming the company is valued at 6x EV/EBITDA, and that debt is paid down to $30 million in 3 years, the EV of the company would be $105-120 million, less $30 million in debt, is a $75-90 million equity valuation. On 18.8 million shares outstanding, the stock would be valued at $4-5.\\n Another scenario that validates that the company could be a 5-10 bagger in as few as 3 years is in a situation where the company has deleveraged, has sales up to $250 million, and is earning, say, 3-4% net profit margins, which would be the equivalent of roughly 40-55 cents in EPS. Stick a multiple of anywhere from 12-20 on those earnings, and you have a stock trading anywhere from $4.80-11.00, or 5-10 times the current price. That having been said, a more modest net profit margin goal for the company would be something on the order of 2.0-2.5%, but even on only $200 million in sales, that gets the company back to $4-5 million in net earnings, or roughly 25 cents in EPS. Place a very conservative 10-12 multiple on that, and you\\'ve got a $2.50-3.00 stock, which is my 1-2 year target range. Risks To Upside Scenario The company\\'s products are mostly supplied from China. Trump\\'s tariffs add a degree of risk and uncertainty here. The company warned about \"gross margin effects\" for Q4 in the Q3 conference call, indicating a negative $500,000 near term impact. While the company has been very pro-active on re-sourcing goods, and raising retail prices, and the company\\'s bankers have expressed great satisfaction in the way the SUMR has handled this matter, the $500,000 is a sunk cost, and the company can ill-afford any more hits to its balance sheet. Monitors, historically, a higher-margin bread and butter category for the company, have become significantly more competitive, with Chinese makers selling and direct shipping to U.S. customers via eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY), Amazon, etc. This increases the risk that the company\\'s new monitor product will not carry its weight. With Wynnefield Capital being a 37% owner, they may very well control the outcome of any potential strategic alternatives scenario, and may act in a self-interested fashion. This having been said, they have been in the stock for over a decade and are almost certainly looking for an end-game as much as anyone is, which is more likely to be favorable than unfavorable.\\n Toys R Us was 17% of sales in 2017. If enough of those sales do not shift to other outlets (as the company is so far realizing), the company may lose market share, or be at risk of suffering a permanent diminution in sales. The company has had a vision of becoming a premium value added player in its space for a long time, but seems to perennially over-promise, and under-deliver. While this management team seems the most qualified in a long time to turn SUMR around, competition from the likes of Graco and others has essentially made SUMR a historic \"also ran,\" which doesn\\'t make significant money because of its small scale and rather high debt. Despite management\\'s optimism, the company may not get the traction needed to compete and survive, as a $200 million a year \"vanity\" infant products outfit. Ultimately, the company MUST grow, in order to cover its SG&A, achieve economies of scale, and secure its future as an independent company. The ability of the company to achieve said sales growth remains to be seen. Furthermore, while the company has just obtained an expanded credit facility, as previously noted, and has the full faith and confidence of its lenders, any further losses may destroy the confidence of lenders, and put the company into a precarious financial situation. Catalysts/Upside to Scenario The new credit deal, with its expanded availability, discontinues the disturbing practice of the company living hand to mouth, and allows SUMR to pursue more strategic projects, intended to grow the business and/or reduce costs (such as the aforementioned warehouse restructuring that was completed this past summer). The company is no longer hamstrung by its working capital deficiency. The company is more stable than investors realize. Adjusted EBITDA was constant at $10 million from 2015 to 2017, and SUMR can eventually be awarded a much higher multiple, especially if unusual items stop hitting the income statement, and material debt pay-downs occur, as seems likely. If the company turns itself around, captures a premium image in the marketplace, and begins to rapidly reduce debt, competitors in the space, who have been waiting for the company to go bankrupt and \"be put out of its misery\" will likely suddenly flip, and see SUMR as an under-priced acquisition candidate. The company could also become of interest to private equity players.\\n Sentiment on the company is still quite negative, especially for those who \"got burned\" buying the stock this past summer. The realization of a turnaround over the next quarter or two is likely to allow the pendulum to swing back rather aggressively in the positive direction it had been, as the company comes back into favor. This could be especially explosive considering the low price of the stock, and low float, where 2/3 of the outstanding shares are effectively \"locked up.\" Conclusion Summer Infant is an extraordinary investment opportunity. A company with a highly experienced and seasoned management team that is implementing a laser focused and sound strategy, it stands poised on the cusp of a noteworthy and demonstrable turnaround, which will catalyze the stock to higher prices. Tellingly, the company\\'s obtaining an expanded credit agreement this past June, only a few months after suffering the unexpected liquidation of its 17% customer, Toys R Us, shows that its lenders know that the company has a bright future ahead of it. That improved future is a reflection of 1) implementation of surgical and prudent cost controls, 2) improved working capital management (including increased use of drop ship and direct import to reduce inventories), 3) the boosting of sales through acceleration of new product introductions and ramping up international sales, 4) boosting gross margins by eliminating sales to channels that devalue the brand, increasing direct-to-consumer sales (now 50% of total sales), and increasing product differentiation, 5) enhancing overall brand value and brand image, 6) expanding relationships with brick and mortar mainstays such as Walmart, Target, Home Depot, and Lowe\\'s, who increasingly see the brand as more consistently and reliably \"premium,\" where they will not be undercut, and 7) relaunching its high-end \"Born Free\" brand in 2019, formerly a \"feeding\" brand, now being rechristened as a \"gear\" brand. On the market\\'s initial expectation, this past summer, of the benefits to accrue from the improvements noted above, the company\\'s stock price rallied to as high as $1.98, but has since lost 60% of its value, in little over 3 months, on no real change in the fundamentals, and strictly as a result of the drastic sell off in small cap stocks (especially those with higher leverage). The company\\'s financial leverage is high but manageable, and the low stock price more than compensates for this fact. Indeed, the company\\'s low .10 price-to-sales ratio, combined with the financial leverage, means that in any turnaround where gross margins improve (the company has already moved mountains in getting its costs down to rock bottom levels), the company will be in a position to generate material profitability and aggressively reduce debt.\\n The company has ramped up efforts to tell its story. The thin float will lead to a sizable stock price increase, on the buying that is to be expected from future earnings releases. In addition, the replacement of its \"crisis era\" CFO with one who is more focused on growth is a harbinger of good things to come. Finally, insider buying in recent weeks, by 37% holder Wynnefield Capital, as well as CEO Mark Messner, where both were buying shares for double the current price in the prior year, show that the company\\'s stock is mispriced, and the time is very propitious, indeed, to enter this stock now, which has essentially retraced virtually all its gains of 2018, and stands, at 80 cents, roughly 10% above its 10-year low.

Amazon investors have basically pulled in \"easy money\" over the past decade as one of the first movers in both online retail and cloud infrastructure rewarded investors with a 2,780% during that time. The current bull narrative predicts market-beating returns going forward as the company takes advantage of economies of scale, a growing e-commerce market, and continued growth from Amazon Web Services. When combined with the recent 30% price drop, the stock looks even more attractive. However, there are no guarantees in investing in even with the bullish factors mentioned above being largely true, I believe there are plenty of risks involved in investing in the e-commerce and cloud infrastructure superpower. The reasons for my cautious view will be outlined below. \\n\\nAMZN data by YCharts AMAZON 3 MONTH PRICE CHANGE  The Good E-commerce  E-commerce operating income was actually negative in 2017 as international losses outweighed small gains in the United States. However, it looks like the tide has turned as operating income in the e-commerce segment has been clearly positive in the first three quarters of 2018 and it looks like things will stay that way. That is good news because I think all of us would agree that e-commerce sales aren\\'t going to decline anytime soon. In fact, the graph below shows that e-commerce in the United States is expected to grow by 38.8% over the next four years.\\n\\nE-COMMERCE GROWTH PROJECTIONS SOURCE: STATISTA\\n Ecosystem Amazon understood the importance of the ecosystem early. In short, ecosystems are situations where products and platforms feed off each other. For instance, now Amazon Prime members get discounts on organic produce at Whole Foods. Members can also stream videos for free. Customers often feel compelled to use benefits when they are entitled so seemingly unrelated items(free shipping and video streaming) tend to feed off each other when connected through the ecosystem. Amazon\\'s most effective ecosystems come from its Prime Membership deal Alexa, the voice-activated virtual assistant. You have to be fairly big to have an effective ecosystem and the other big boys like Apple,(AAPL) Microsoft(MSFT) and Alphabet(GOOG) have them as well. However, a tip of the cap has to be given to CEO Jeff Bezos and his management team as Amazon recognized the importance of ecosystems early and used them often. Amazon Web Services If I had to pick one thing to make the bull case for Amazon, I would pick Amazon Web Services. AWS provides on-demand cloud computing platforms to individuals, companies, and governments. Amazon was the first mover in this space and built a big lead as its competitors resisted recognizing the importance of cloud technology, in part because it would cause them to disrupt themselves. Bezos was right, of course, and Amazon retains a dominant market share to this day. The number varies by the source but most reports have Amazon holding about 33% market share in the cloud infrastructure market. The good thing about being a first mover in any infrastructure space is there tends to be costs in terms of both time and money associated with switching. Therefore, all other things equal, your customers have a tendency to say put. \\n\\n SOURCE: AMAZON.COM\\n The Bad There are not a lot of straight out negatives with regard to Amazon, but there is a strong case to be made that a lot of positives are overblown and a tempering of those positives combined with an above-average valuation combine to form a significant caution flag. Here are some points I would make in that regard. E-commerce E-commerce is great, right? According to TechCrunch, Amazon now accounts for 49% of all online retail sales in the United States. So, what\\'s the problem? Well, first of all, online retail is not a very profitable business. When you back out AWS from operating results, Amazon reported $3.32 billion in income for the first nine months of this year. However, it took $142 billion in sales to get there. That leaves an operating margin of a paltry 2.3% Jeff Bezos famous tagline has been, \"Your margin is my opportunity.\" The strategy of trading profits for market share has worked in that it has made Sears,(OTCPK:SHLDQ) JC Penney,(JCP) and some other bricks and mortar retailers irrelevant. However, it has also energized the big boys to fight back. Now almost everyone offers free shipping(previously an Amazon selling point) and companies like Walmart,(WMT) Target,(TGT) and Dicks Sporting Goods,(DKS) just to name a few, are also willing to trade margin for sales volume. With free shipping being commonplace and Amazon now charging sales tax, the online retailer has lost at least some of its special sauce. While I know that Amazon accounts for 49% of online sales, I also know I personally took advantage of equal or better online deals this holiday season and purchased items from Target, Kohls,(KSS) Walmart, Tractor Supply Co.,(TSCO) DeepDiscount.com, Best Buy,(BBY) Urban Outfitters,(URBN) and eBay.(EBAY) The fact that large retailers such as Walmart, Kohls, and Best Buy have a \"buy online, pick up in-store\" option further mitigates any advantage Amazon would have from fast, free shipping. Motivated Rivals Jeff Bezos has stated that his business strategy is to be passionately customer-centric. However, it is fair to point out he is also very, very, competitor conscious. His famous line, \"Your margin is my opportunity.\" not only shows he is highly conscious of competitors, but he is aggressively coming after them.\\n While business is business and all if fair in love and war, let\\'s acknowledge that Bezos and his competitors are at war. Amazon has become powerful enough that Bezos has been called out by our very own president. The competition is heated enough that Amazon\\'s most profitable segment, AWS, has been called out publicly by both Microsoft and Oracle. In fact, Larry Ellison spent much of a recent keynote criticizing AWS and its perceived shortcomings. All this is not to say AWS is a bad or even mediocre product, but it does mean competitors are highly motivated to attack, compete, and get a bigger slice of the overall pie.  A Story Stock Amazon has been a story stock for a long time. Investors in story stocks don\\'t really care about current valuation metrics because they believe the story is so compelling and growth potential is so great that current ratios don\\'t matter. All of the FANG stocks were story stocks at one time in their history. However, as you can see below, every company \"matures\" and begins to become evaluated by traditional valuation metrics. Amazon is still being given the \"story\" premium but the story, even the cloud story, is no longer new, and within a couple years, the company could become will likely be evaluated like everyone else. \\n\\nAMZN PE Ratio (NYSE:TTM) data by YCharts FANG STOCKS\\' PE RATIOS OVER TIME Valuation Amazon does a lot of things but from a business segment standpoint, it basically competes in two areas: retail sales and cloud infrastructure. Let\\'s take a look at Amazon\\'s valuation as well as that of its competitors in each industry to see how the company compares.   Company Forward PE PEG EV/EBITDA   Amazon.com 50.32 1.53 29.38   Walmart 18 4.25 9.55   Target 10.97 1.43 6.72   Best Buy 8.77 .57 4.96   DATA SOURCE: YAHOO FINANCE   Company Forward PE PEG EV/EBITDA   Amazon.com 50.32 1.53 29.38   Microsoft 18 1.55 15.38   Alibaba 19.66 * 27.81   Oracle 11.63 1.35 11.03   DATA SOURCE: YAHOO FINANCE As shown, Amazon is much more expensive than peers in each industry based on current valuation metrics. The PEG ratio is in the ballpark of most of its peers, however, that ratio does assume an average of 44% EPS growth over the next five years. The Potentially Ugly The ugliness could come if the company loses its story stock status and comes to be valued as a relatively mature company. Things could also become ugly if Amazon\\'s formidable competitors in the cloud space either take away significant market share or ironically, use Amazon\\'s margins and their opportunity, and try to undercut Amazon in price, lowering margins for everybody. In addition, there have been several reports questioning Amazon\\'s accounting practices and the SEC recently got in on the action. If the investing world starts to question whether Amazon has been intentionally misleading with their numbers and trust becomes an issue, that won\\'t bode well for the stock price. Looking Ahead Amazon is certainly going to grow in the coming years. I don\\'t think anyone can question that. However, I do think 44% earnings growth over the next five is very optimistic. Analysts expect the company to earn $38.96 per share in 2020. If we applied a PE of 30 at the end of 2020, which would still be valuing the company as being in above-average growth mode, Amazon would be left with a stock price of $1168. Takeaway I have the utmost respect for Jeff Bezos. I think he is a visionary and maybe a genius. I am convinced Amazon will have a strong finish to 2018 and a very good year in 2019 as well. However, I also think Amazon has lost much of its special sauce in the low margin online retail space. A lot of companies can do what Amazon is doing in retail and do it pretty well. If Amazon is going to meet the market\\'s growth expectations beyond 2019, it is going to have to be an AWS story. I am sure AWS will continue to do well but with competition heating up, I believe analysts\\' expectations of 44% EPS growth are a bit much. Good company, great leader. But with this much optimism priced in, I am putting my investing dollars somewhere else. \\n\\nDisclosure: I/we have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

As of Christmas Day, GOVIX has had a -9.56% return while the Morningstar natural resources category has a -22.74% return. This was very interesting especially given the nature of the fund’s market capitalization. As you can see below, GOVIX has a significant advantage in terms of the riskier small-cap holdings as opposed to its benchmark and category advantage as well as a significant deficit in terms of the holdings in the giant-cap market capitalization.   Size % of Portfolio Benchmark Category Average   Giant 12.84 26.12 24.27   Large 39.78 43.38 29.48   Medium 27.02 25.16 34.10   Small 17.85 5.28 11.77   Micro 2.51 0.06 0.38   Interestingly enough, GOVIX’s price-to earnings measures (price-to book, price-earnings, price-to sales, price-to cash flow) were at a deficit compared to the benchmark and category average. GOVIX has a P/E ratio of 8.34 compared to the benchmark P/E of 17.78 and industry average P/E of 15.32. Investors will be very pleased with the funds’s dividend yield of 5.06. This total is more than double the average dividend yield of the category benchmark (2.31) and category average (2.22). So the question remains: What are the main holdings in the portfolio that allows this fund to be much tougher than the rest? In order to answer this question, I analyzed the top 25 holdings and found holdings that packed the right amount of punch in terms of both portfolio weight and YTD Return. It should be noted that Rio Tinto PLC, the fund’s second best holding in terms of portfolio weight had a YTD return of 1.50%. However, the following holdings have definitely spearheaded the firm’s above-average results.\\n   Holdings Portfolio Weight YTD Return   Anglo American PLC 3.57 17.18%   BradeSpar SA 3.39 12.83%   BHP Billiton PLC 3.01 13.36%   PJSC Lukoil ADR 2.50 31.91%   Vestas Wind Systems 2.03 18.99%   Gazprom Neft PJSC 1.82 46.05%   Austevoll Seafood ASA. 1.65 72.01%   Israel Chemicals Ltd 1.48 49.30%   Tatneft OAO ADR 1.27 32.78%   It also helps that only six of the fund’s top 25 holdings are in negative territory. It should be noted that there was only one small-cap holding in the top 25. Thus, we must infer that the above-average small-cap weightings that the fund has must be in holdings with less portfolio weight. Fund holders will be pleased to know that the fund manager has had a good history of performing at an above-average level in down markets in recent years as well as holding their own in down markets. Given that we are in the midst of a potential bear market, investors will be pleased at the firm’s downside capture ratio.   Fund Upside Capture Ratio – 1 Year Downside Capture Ratio 1 -Year Upside Capture Ratio – 3 Year Downside Capture Ratio – 3 Year   GOVIX 130.16 86.79 128.64 51.42   Benchmark 79.70 127.91 92.91 124.84   GOVIX is cheaper than your average fund in this category. With a rate of 0.71, the firm’s expense ratio is more than half as much as the Morningstar Category Average.  In a potential bear market, you will need a fund that can be a staunch defender in market downturns. The fund’s above-average dividend yield and cheap expense ratio certainly does help its attractiveness. GOVIX is certainly worth a look.\\nDisclosure: I/we have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

Weight Watchers updated its full year GAAP EPS guidance to a range of $3.15 to $3.25 compared to a prior range of $3.10 to $3.25, reflecting “the continued strong flow through to profitability and incorporating a lower tax rate”. The stock dropped 30% the next day! What's going on? Exhibit 1: Share price performance \\n\\nSource: Koyfin Operational leverage A year ago we posted a bullish article on Weight Watchers based on the premise that the positive impact of the operational leverage in Weight Watchers’ subscription business was underestimated by the market. The power of the subscription business is once you return to growth, you experience a strong operational leverage given the low cost to serve incremental subscribers. We felt that the earnings forecasts were simply too low. The following earnings releases confirmed this view and due to rising earnings estimates the stock rose from $45 to $70. The sentiment around Weight Watchers switched from too negative to too positive and we advised to sell. Major shareholder Artal did the same by selling 7.5 million shares in a secondary public offering priced at $69. The stock even climbed above $100 a share. But operational leverage is a knife that cuts both ways and after the disappointing third quarter figures the stock is currently around $40. Has sentiment simply shifted again to too negative or is something else happening?\\n Tax rate Earlier this year we counted on an earnings per share of $3.01 (with a tax rate of 26%). At the publication of the third quarter results Weight Watchers declared they now expect a tax rate of about 11% for the full year. At this tax rate our expected earnings per share jump (ceteris paribus) to $3.57! In the previous guidance, Weight Watchers was counting on a 15% tax rate. At this rate our earnings per share would be $3.41. The lower than expected tax rate has a positive impact of $0.16 on this year’s earnings per share. For next year Weight Watchers’ management again assumes a 26% tax rate. Despite this positive tax rate impact Weight Watchers updated its full year GAAP EPS guidance to a range of $3.15 to $3.25 compared to a prior range of $3.10 to $3.25. Given the lower than expected tax rate, the guidance should have been updated much higher if everything went well operationally. But this didn’t seem to be the case. We are forced to call the updated guidance a profit warning (in disguise) …. One of Dennis Gartman’s 19 rules of trading is the following: “Remember, there is never just one cockroach”. This means that the lesson of bad news is that more shall follow... usually hard upon and always with worsening impact…. Is Weight Watchers hit by seasonality or is it heading for another profit warning? Seasonality Weight Watchers’ management pointed to the seasonality in subscriber trends for the disappointing figures. Weight Watchers has predictable seasonal subscriber trends with the highest volumes of member recruitments occurring in winter, particularly in January. Historically, approximately 40% of the annual member recruitments have occurred during the first quarter of the year. Therefore, each year the first quarter is the peak for End of Period Subscribers and each year end is the low point. Weight Watchers went from 3.2 million End of Period Subscribers at the end of 2017 to a record 4.6 million at the end of the first quarter that moved to 4.5 million and 4.2 million at the ends of the second and third quarter, respectively. And Weight Watchers expects to end 2018 with up to 4 million subscribers, a 12% decline from the first quarter end level, but a 25% increase in level year-over-year.\\n Exhibit 2: End of Period Subscribers \\n\\nSource: Weight Watchers presentation Regardless of the seasonality, the third quarter was the second quarter in a row where year-over-year sales growth has decelerated, as has the number of End of Period Subscribers. Exhibit 3: Revenues and End of Period Subscribers \\n\\nSource: Weight Watchers presentation Will Weight Watchers be able to reach its 2018 targets for End of Period Subscribers of 4 million and revenue of $1.53 billion? Valuation and price target We now expect Weight Watchers to generate free cash flows of $223 million and $258 million for this and next year, respectively. Exhibit 4: Free cash flow projections \\n\\n Source: own calculations Based on our below consensus expected EPS of $3.34 for next year, Weight Watchers trades currently at a forward PE of (only) 12.3 Our DCF-based price target is $55. This implies a forward PE of 16.5 and assumes Weight Watchers succeeds in reaching its $2 billion revenue target in 2020. Price momentum On the graph of Weight Watchers we can clearly see that the trend turned down. Exhibit 5: Price chart \\n\\nSource: StockCharts\\n Conclusion The sentiment around Weight Watchers is very negative and this is clearly reflected in Weight Watchers’ current valuation: it trades at a forward PE of only 12.3! But the proof of the pudding is in the eating: it might be wise to wait for next quarterly results to see if Weight Watchers reaches its 2018 targets for End of Period Subscribers of 4 million and revenues of $1.53 billion. If not, Weight Watchers’ 2020 target for End of Period Subscribers of 5 million and revenues of $2 billion might be in jeopardy.

Lifetime vaccines, such as Hepatitis A, help recipients develop antibodies that will protect them for their entire life. These vaccines are long-lasting because the disease from which people are being protected does not mutate from year to year. In contrast, annual vaccines, such as the influenza vaccine, must be given every year because the infecting virus changes every year. Novavax (NVAX) is attempting to develop a single RSV vaccine that does not change even though the RSV virus changes. Researchers have found great variability in the virus strains over time. One study notes that researchers “ have shown a worldwide distribution of RSV strains with both local and global replacement of dominant viruses with time.” \\n\\n In layman’s terms, this means that the virus changes from season to season, much like the flu vaccine. That’s why one year’s flu vaccine doesn’t properly shield you from the next season’s flu strains. While it’s our understanding that the flu vaccine changes more often than RSV, the principle is the same. As a result, RSV “ reinfection is common throughout the lifespan,” as per the National Foundation for Infectious Diseases.\\n In addition, even after being infected with RSV, humans don’t achieve lifelong immunity. The American Lung Associates states, “ Because people do not form long-lasting immunity to RSV, they can become infected repeatedly over their lifetime.” \\n\\n We believe the two points above have significant negative implications for Novavax’s RSV vaccine, which is named RSV F, and we believe Novavax’s PREPARE Phase 3 trial to protect infants from RSV infections via maternal immunization is likely to fail. Novavax uses the same RSV F vaccine every season despite changes to the RSV virus Given the constantly changing dynamics of RSV, we believe Novavax’s approach to vaccine formulation is likely to prove ineffective. We note that Novavax has used the same vaccine every year. In fact, Novavax’s RSV F vaccine in the PREPARE Phase 3 trial is the same RSV F vaccine that failed in the RESOLVE Phase 3 trial – no changes to the vaccine have been made since then. \\n\\n The current PREPARE Phase 3 has been ongoing since December 2015, which means that Novavax has been using the same vaccine for nearly 3 years while wild RSV strains have continued to mutate around the world in unpredictable ways. Therefore, we believe Novavax’s vaccine is unlikely to work in the PREPARE Phase 3 trial. In fact, this was definitively shown in a previous Phase 3 trial that Novavax conducted in elderly patients. In that Phase 3 trial called RESOLVE, Novavax’s RSV F vaccine performed almost the same as the placebo arm in the primary endpoint and actually performed worse than placebo in a key secondary endpoint.\\n \\n\\n In our opinion, Novavax is now trying the same failed vaccine in a harder to treat patient population (infants) through an unproven and unestablished method (via maternal immunization). Maternal immunization provides limited help to infants Even if Novavax’s RSV F vaccine does provide immunity from RSV, we think maternal transfer immunization provides limited help to infants. First, we want to make clear that pregnant mothers are not given vaccines to protect the infant through maternal immunization. This is simply not accepted nor practiced. The FDA states, “ Currently, there are no vaccines approved by FDA specifically for use during pregnancy to protect the infant.” The two predominant vaccines, Tdap and influenza, are given to pregnant mothers to “prevent disease in the mother,” as shown in slide 10 of this FDA update for vaccines given to pregnant women. \\n\\n While some people may believe that vaccines for the mother provide fetal and neonatal benefit through the passive transfer of protective antibodies across the placenta, the antibodies from the mother don’t last long enough to provide robust protection to the infant. This is because of the short half-life of the antibodies that are transferred. Of the antibodies produced in the human body, only “ maternal immunoglobulin G is actively transported across the placenta.” However, the half-life of immunoglobulin G is only 10-21 days, which is extremely short. This has significant implications for the PREPARE Phase 3 study since antibodies disappear over time and aren’t reproduced. The only thing that remains are memory B cells which are specific to the virus strain and don’t confer immunity to different strains in the future.\\n Pregnant mothers in the PREPARE Phase 3 study are administered the vaccine in the third trimester, which is from Week 27 until birth (usually at Week 40). If we assume that the pregnant women in PREPARE are dosed after the start of the third trimester at Week 30, and that they reach peak antibody levels after 4 weeks at Week 34, we calculate that by the time of birth, the baby will have at best 25% of the peak antibody titer, assuming a 21 day half-life. If we assume a 10 day half-life, then the baby will only have ~6% of peak antibody titer. \\n\\n Moreover, we know that “ RSV does not usually occur until a baby is 4 to 6 weeks old,” and that RSV hospitalizations in infants peak at around 8 weeks. We calculate that during that key 4 week span, infants in the trial will have between 0% to 13% of peak antibody titer. We don’t believe this is nearly robust enough to provide meaningful benefit to infants from RSV. \\n\\n Novavax’s PREPARE Phase 3 trial faces a very high bar for success, which we believe it won’t meet We also believe that the bar for success is incredibly high for Novavax in its Phase 3 PREPARE trial and that Novavax has made it worse by taking actions that raise the statistical hurdle. Based on research published in the New England Journal of Medicine, Journal of Global Health, and from Novavax’s low reported RSV rates in previous Phase 2 and Phase 3 trials, we believe the incidence rate for moderate to severe RSV in infants is around 2%. A low infection rate has significant implications. Novavax has stated that the Phase 3 trial is powered with a lower bound confidence interval of 30%. With such a low RSV attack rate, that means that Novavax has to show a huge difference in the 2 arms to hit statistical significance.\\n We calculate that for the trial to hit its p-value, it needs to exhibit a 58% difference in the 2 arms for the lower confidence bound interval to be greater than 30%. In other words, we believe the PREPARE Phase 3 trial has to show a 2.5% vs 1.5% difference in the arms. That’s extremely difficult to do given what we know about the trial, which we go into next. We’ve spoken with an experienced biostatistician who has reviewed Novavax’s publically released information about the PREPARE Phase 3 trial’s “ informational analysis” conducted late 2017, and the biostatistician believes that the informational analysis was a form of interim analysis. We believe this means that the informational analysis spent up some alpha and increased the chances of Type 1 error. To account for this, Novavax has to raise the threshold for statistical significance at the trial’s final look. In addition, we know that Novavax is essentially stopping the trial early. The PREPARE Phase 3 trial was originally designed to have 8,255 patients, and, as of last year, it was supposed to run until May of 2020. Now, Novavax is stopping the trial 2 years early with just 4,636 patients, or a little more than half of the original targeted population. Fewer patients means fewer events. Accordingly, we believe that the PREPARE Phase 3 trial will have to show even greater differences between the 2 arms to hit statistical significance. \\n\\n We are short Novavax with a price target of $0 We are short Novavax. We believe the PREPARE Phase 3 trial will fail, just like the RESOLVE Phase 3 trial. This would be Novavax’s second large Phase 3 failure in RSV, which we believe will render the program worthless. We also believe the Novavax’s NanoFlu vaccine has limited utility. In our opinion, the vaccine has shown underwhelming immunogenicity data, and will require large and expensive efficacy trials for FDA approval. We may discuss this in greater detail in the future.\\n In fact, we believe Novavax’s entire vaccine platform is worthless. A close examination of the company’s history shows that despite planned vaccine announcements for malaria, Zika, Ebola, and pandemic influenza vaccine in its history, Novavax has failed to develop any of them. Moreover, we note that Novavax has a Going Concern warning from its auditors (see Note 2 in the latest 10-Q), and that Novavax has less than 1 year of cash remaining at current burn rates. Even if Novavax had adequate cash, it still has a $325 million convertible bond on its balance sheet that will become due in a little over 3 years. We believe the company will soon be insolvent and that its vaccine programs are worthless. Our price target for Novavax is $0, and we believe it is a compelling short. \\n\\n\\nDisclosure: I am/we are short NVAX. I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions.

This is a stark difference from earlier this year when prices were frequently above $65 per barrel and even briefly reached $75 per barrel. Although I’m bullish regarding oil prices in the medium to long-term, I recognize it will be a bumpy ride as they’re notoriously volatile. This recent crash is an excellent example of why every oil and gas company should always do their utmost to ensure their financial position is strong, otherwise they’re left unprepared when prices take a sudden downturn. Unfortunately for Anadarko Petroleum’s (APC) shareholders, their overly aggressive dividends and buyback program has left them in a considerably weaker position to weather this storm than the last one four years ago. \\n\\n Image Source: Nasdaq.\\n Prelude Early this year I first published an article outlining the dangers involved with their large buyback program and approximately two months ago I subsequently revisited this topic and warned these dangers still remained despite oil prices continuing to rally. Since then oil prices have fallen substantially and their situation has gone from bad to worse, which is reflected by their share price falling approximately 25% since my last article was published. Whereas my previous articles focused on the dangers of their buyback program, this article focuses on their unpreparedness if this recent oil price crash continues as well as their guidance for next year. Past Versus Present  The oil price crash of 2014-2016 was an extremely tough time for every oil and gas company, especially Anadarko who saw their share price plunge up to 70% as their gearing ratio soared ever higher. If they had one saving grace, it was entering this previous crash with a decent financial position. Although their gearing ratio of 36.69% at the end of 2014 wasn’t particularly low, it’s still substantially better than their current gearing ratio of 56.86%, which even exceeds the highest point during the previous oil price crash of 51.81%. It’s not just their gearing ratio that is concerning, their interest coverage ratio from the first nine months of this year was only 3.05, which is very low considering this was during times when oil prices were quite supportive. Aside from a stronger financial position, another benefit they had four years ago verse now was more scope to reduce their capital expenditure through improved efficiency and most notably, squeezing suppliers and service companies. Whilst it’s debatable whether they can once again improve their efficiency in a short period of time, I see little reason to believe they can squeeze their suppliers for significantly lower prices. There has yet to be sufficient time pass since the last crash for any material cost inflation to occur across the sector, evidenced by services companies like Schlumberger (SLB) still struggling to increase their earnings anywhere near 2014 levels.\\n My graph below clearly shows that despite reducing their net debt in late 2016 and early 2017, Anadarko has allowed this to creep back up to record high levels, which leaves them unprepared to handle any downturn. \\n\\n Image Source: Author. The primary culprit of this recent increase in net debt and gearing ratio is Anadarko’s debt funded dividends and buyback program. In light of this significantly weak financial position it’s reasonable to assume buybacks would be off the table, however, sadly this wasn’t the case even though they didn’t generate any free cash flow. During the first nine months of this year they generated $4.302b of operating cash flow and whilst this was a massive increase year over year, after subtracting their $4.891b of capital expenditure this left their free cash flow at negative $589m. Even if I’m generous and include the positive effects of their divestitures totalling $393m, their free cash flow was still negative $196m. Leaving aside the $365m of distributions to non-controlling interests, their further $380m of dividends and $2.476b of buybacks during this same period of time has obviously been funded through increasing their debt and depleting their cash reserves. Given the collapse in oil prices and Anadarko’s ongoing buyback program, dividends and capital expenditure, I wouldn’t be surprised to see their gearing ratio reach approximately 60% by the end of this quarter. Unless oil prices rebound strongly in the short term or they completely cease their dividends and buybacks, which doesn’t appear to the case, it’s easy to see their gearing ratio quickly heading towards a completely unsustainable 70%. In light of this situation, I see no way anyone could honestly make a case that Anadarko is well prepared for another downturn. If oil prices don\\'t recover in the short term, it’s going to be extremely difficult for them to cover their capital expenditure with operating cash flow, let alone any shareholder returns. Even if oil prices have bottomed and rally strongly, unless they change their capital management policies they’re still going to be unprepared whenever the next serious downturn occurs. I see zero reasons a company with an indebted financial position, operating in a highly cyclical industry should further increase their debt in order to repurchase their own shares.\\n Whilst on the surface their financial performance during 2015 and 2016 may seem rather impressive as their net debt actually decreased slightly from $12.933b to $12.139b, this doesn’t accurately tell the entire story. During these same two years their net divestitures (divestitures + sale of subsidiaries – acquisitions) were $3.378b and their net equity issuances (equity issued – equity repurchased) were a further $2.129b, for a combined total of $5.507b. This is a very significant amount of capital to raise, especially during a downturn when asset and equity prices were depressed and is exactly the type of actions that could have been avoided with a stronger financial position. Since they were forced to take these undesirable actions during the last downturn which they entered in a better financial position than now, it’s quite reasonable to expect this will be repeated if oil prices fail to recover in the short term. Observant readers who’ve been following Anadarko for a number of years will likely recall their equity raising was to fund their acquisition of Freeport McMoRan’s (FCX) Gulf of Mexico assets and whilst this is technically correct, I see it as a slight of hand misdirection. During this same year, 2016, their divestitures and sales of subsidiaries totaled $3.519b, which was ample to cover their acquisitions totaling $1.74b. A weak financial position is the only reason a company would issue new equity whilst their share price is depressed to fund an acquisition, whilst simultaneously divesting an even greater value of assets, not to mention they raised almost $400m more than was required to purchase the assets. Looking Towards The Future Looking towards next year Anadarko has announced a further $1b increase to their buyback program, a 20% increase to their dividend and perplexingly an additional $500m increase to their debt ‘reduction’ program. Yet again increasing an already overly aggressive buyback program whilst oil prices are crashing will only further exacerbate their already weak financial position and make it even more difficult to navigate any rough times ahead.\\n On the surface when an investor reads “debt reduction” it’s likely they’re expecting this means the company is simply lowering their financial debt and thus strengthening their financial position. Once analyzing Anadarko’s latest SEC filings and weighing this against their large buyback program, it’s clear their debt reduction will continue to be another slight of hand trick. They have been promoting this debt reduction plan for a while now, as I discussed in one of my previous articles. At the beginning of the third quarter Anadarko\\'s management promoted their debt reduction program, which was to be conducted through the use of debt buybacks. Whilst this initially sounds as though they\\'ve been lowering their debt, this has not actually been the case. Their cash flow statement, see below, clearly shows these debt \"reductions\" of $1.176b were more than completely funded by issuing new debt totaling $2.131b. The remainder of this new debt, along with depleting their cash reserves, has funded their buybacks and dividends. So in effect, they have been replacing their old debt with an even greater amount of newly issued debt. \\n\\n Image Source: Anadarko 2018 Q3 10Q Report. The positive takeaway from next year’s guidance is their capital expenditure should decrease relative to this year and sit at $4.3b to $4.7b, however, it’s worthwhile mentioning their 2018 guidance originally stated capital expenditure of $4.2b to $4.6b. This is practically the same and thus they will still require supportive oil prices to produce any free cash flow. Although their forecast oil production growth of 10% for next year sounds promising, the extent this will benefit depends on the direction of oil prices in the short term.\\n Final Thoughts I expect when Anadarko faces the next cyclical downturn, whether it’s going to be 2019 or another year, they will provide another classic example of a company buying their shares high and selling them low to strengthen their financial position. I can respect the notion their managers would have a significant amount of operational knowledge, however, the numbers in the SEC filings don’t lie and increasing debt to repurchase shares is seldom wise in the long-term. This reminds me of Warren Buffett’s famous quote that it’s “only when the tide goes out do you discover who\\'s been swimming naked”. Regardless of when the tide goes out, figuratively speaking, unless Anadarko changes direction with their buyback program they will be proven to be swimming naked. Conclusion Even though Anadarko entered the previous crash with a decent financial position, they were still forced to take undesirable actions such as an equity raising and significant asset divestitures. Since their current financial position is significantly worse than it was last time, if this current crash continues in either length or severity they will be once again forced to take these actions to shore up their financial position. It’s my belief Anadarko’s shares are only suitable for traders who are very bullish regarding oil prices in the short term. Due to their weak financial position that stems from their debt funded buyback program, I believe their shares aren’t suitable for investors as there is very little margin of safety should oil prices stay depressed for even twelve months. If this occurs I wouldn’t be surprised if they’re forced to undertake an equity raising, effectively buying their shares high and selling them low. Therefore, I will continue to avoid their shares and pursue other oil sector investments that I believe offer a superior risk to return profile, such as Exxon Mobil (XOM).

Overview Hilton Worldwide Holdings is a global hotel manager, operator of franchises, and owner of a variety of hotel chains and brands. The company's brands are some of the most well-known and ubiquitous in the hotel industry.  The company previously owned hotels, but after the spin-off of Park, a REIT that now runs a vast real estate portfolio, and Hilton Grand Vacations, a timeshare company, the company now focuses the vast majority of its attention on managing and franchising hotels.  As of the end of last year, the company owned, managed, and franchised 5,284 properties with 856,115 rooms across 105 countries. Of these properties, 565 are managed and 4,507 are franchised. When the company manages a hotel, it pays for and deals with the day-to-day operations of a hotel in exchange for a fee that is usually based on a percentage of the hotel's gross revenue. When the company franchises a hotel, it licenses out its operation system to a the franchisee, who then pays Hilton a licensing fee based on a percentage of gross revenue.  This business model is attractive for obvious reasons. By mostly licensing out its operational systems through franchises, the business has dramatically decreased the capital needed for expansion. Whereas, previously, it would have had to buy land and buildings in order to set up a hotel, it now has hotel franchisees that want to open up Hilton hotels come to it and charges them a fee. The required capital expenditures decrease rapidly and the exposure to things like real estate risk also decrease. In many ways, this business model is akin to software companies who license out or sell their software. They invest resources into creating a product that is easily and cheaply producible, and when they go to market, they have a reliable, low-cost source of cash. \\n So, overall, the company is able to make use of its strong brand, efficient, capital-light structure, and decades of experiences to rapidly expand its network of hotels and increase cash flows and revenue.  Income On almost all fronts, the business is growing. In 2017, revenues were $9.1 billion, up from $7.4 billion in 2016 and $7.1 billion in 2015. Operating income increased from $900 million in 2015 to $1.37 billion in 2017. Franchise fees have grown from $1 billion in 2015 to $1.38 billion in 2017, mostly as a result of increases in room rates and new managed and franchised properties. Two key metrics that are important in Hilton's business are ADR, or Average Daily Rate, and RevPAR, or Revenue per Available Room. ADR measures the average rate that Hilton hotels are able to get for one night in a room. RevPAR measures something similar, but weights ADR based on the proportion of available rooms that are actually occupied. In 2017, room occupancy across the system was 75.5%, up 1.2% since 2016. ADR was up 0.9% while RevPAR was up 2.5%. According to these important measures, then, the business is doing well. These measures, however, don't account for growth in rooms. For example, ADR and RevPAR could stay the same from year to year, but if Hilton increases its portfolio of properties, it's grown the business. And, that is happening. Part of the reason that revenues increased in 2017 is because of increased in franchised and managed hotels, as mentioned earlier.  And, based on the company's development plans, there is plenty of growth on the horizon. As of the end of last year, there were 2,257 hotels and 345,000 rooms in the developmental pipeline across 107 locations. As of the last quarter, there were 371,000 rooms in the pipeline. Room growth is almost certainly the most direct way for the company to fuel growth. If all 371,000 rooms are completed and produced revenue that is equal to the 2017 RevPAR average, the current pipeline can fuel revenue growth of over 40%. And, as mentioned earlier, all that growth will come with very little capital investment. \\n So, in the future, total revenues could be roughly $12.5 billion, with operating income being roughly $1.9 billion, a substantial increased compared to last fiscal year.  Cash Flow As mentioned earlier, cash flows are an especially important metric of evaluation for Hilton because their business is designed in a way that facilitate cash generation, since the company's revenues are almost wholly fee-based. The company's operating cash flow, however, has decreased over the past few years, as shown by the graph below. \\n\\nHLT Cash from Operations (Annual) data by YCharts The decrease in operating cash flow in 2017 was a result of the spin-off of the company's timeshare units. The decrease in operating cash flow in 2016 was a result of an increase in taxes of $202 million. So, overall, operating cash flows aren't doing as poorly as the the pure figures show.  Capital expenditures decreased from 2016 to 2017, going from $317 million to $58 million. The decrease was mostly a result of a decreased costs due to the company's spin-off of Park and HGV, two businesses that were both asset heavy and required large capital expenditures. The new figure is more in line with what the company can experience in the future.  With these numbers, the analyst could try and estimate free cash flows in the future. Conservatively, let's assume that operating cash flow will stay at roughly $900 million moving forward, slightly less than the 2017 figure. This figure takes into account the decrease in operating cash flow after the timeshare spin-off, but it also doesn't take future growth into account either. Capital expenditures could conservatively be estimated to be roughly $70 million, a conservative premium over the figure for last year, which accounts for the decrease in capital expenditures after the recent spin-offs while also accounting for any future increases. \\n So, overall, free cash flow moving forward could conceivably be estimated at roughly $830 million. This puts P/FCF at roughly 23, which is relatively high.  Competitive Landscape and Market Environment Hilton's a name brand with a large global footprint, and as a result, it definitely has a competitive moat. Any hotel owner in the world knows that they'll make a safe bet if they operate under the Hilton umbrella. It's hard to imagine a new hotel franchiser entering the market and putting up a fight against big name brands like Hilton and Marriott. As a result, it's safe to say that Hilton's business will be protected in the long-run.  Another thing to consider is how business will be for Hilton moving forward. Most investors believe that the global economy, and especially the US economy, has been doing relatively well over the past few years and since the financial crisis. This recovery will not last forever, and eventually the economy will experience a downturn. Some believe, based on the performance of the market over the past few weeks, that that downturn has begun.  How will this affect Hilton? If there is a recession up ahead, it's almost a certainty that Hilton will be negatively affected. People will travel less for business and pleasure, and occupancy and room rates will go down. In the long-run, however, it's likely that Hilton, along with the rest of the hotel industry, will be fine. People will, in the long-run, travel more and use more hotel rooms, which will be a benefit to Hilton.  Share Repurchase Program  The company repurchased $891 million of stock in 2017. In the first quarter of 2018, the company bought $110 million in stocks. In the second quarter, repurchased $1.3 billion of stock, which included shares repurchased from HNA Group and Blackstone. In the third quarter, the company repurchased $122 million in shares.  Not all share repurchase programs are created equal, and in my opinion, Hilton's repurchase program is not exemplary. Share repurchases ought to be done with capital allocation in mind. Repurchases are a great idea when it's obvious that a company's shares are undervalued and that there aren't any better uses of capital than investing in the company's own shares. \\n In Hilton's case, it's really unlikely that shares are selling at a steep discount with a P/FCF ratio of over 20. It's more likely that Hilton's share repurchase program is created to check a box in a way. Company's with a share repurchase program are considered to be shareholder-friendly on the whole, so having one even when it's an inefficient use of capital is a good idea because it pleases investors at a very basic level.  In my opinion, this is a bad sign. Other companies use share repurchases efficiently and mindfully, but that doesn't seem like the case for Hilton.  Valuation and Conclusion In my view, Hilton isn't undervalued at all. It's hard to tell whether it's very overvalued, but with a P/FCF ratio greater than 20 and likely headwinds in the short-term, the stock definitely isn't undervalued.  The company does have a lot of positive qualities, however. It's asset-light, growing, and generates good cash flow. However, all these qualities are easily appreciated by the market. And as a result, it's hard for the company to ever by steeply undervalued. However, the business is definitely one to keep an eye on. \\nDisclosure: I/we have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

This places it earlier, or higher-up, in the world\\'s supply chain than consumption-driven economies, and suggests it and its markets could be a leading indicator. Indeed. a look back at the large iShares China ETF (FXI) from 2007 onward shows that several times, when FXI has fallen 20% from its high, it has led significant corrections in the S&P 500 (SPY) as well the Great Recession\\'s horrible bear market. (In addition, China has a huge internal economy; it is far from \"just\" an exporter.) With that background, on October 10 I noted some issues in China and wrote Is China Breaking? Some Evidence And Potential Implications. The article pointed to a local survey, The CKGSB Business Conditions Index, which had turned down sharply. It remains in negative territory, but is off the bottom. I drew bearish implications for stocks and commodities from this and other data, and a bullish implication for Treasury bond funds (TLT). That information fit with my longstanding call for market turbulence in the US in Q3-4 related to the reverse taper of the Fed\\'s quantitative tightening program (which I think is better called reverse QE, or rQE).  There are a few new matters to consider regarding China. Beginning with the latest CKGSB commentary from Professor Li Wei, China may be moving even more toward less Communism and more free market. China - freer markets ahead?\\n This is interesting. The moderate improvement in the index was effusively attributed to a greater commitment both to freer markets and lower taxes. This sounds as if someone could have been talking about one of the last several Republican presidents rather than the President for life of China:  Why has there been such a dramatic shift this month? The most important reason is a change in policy. Recently, the government made public a series of concrete, large-scale offers to support private enterprises, especially the hardest-hit, private SMEs. President Xi Jinping... pronounced that private enterprises had “ contributed more than 50% of tax revenue, 60% of GDP, 70% of innovations, 80% of urban employment, and 90% of enterprises.” In addition to giving a much needed confidence boost to private business, President Xi Jinping offered six specific proposals to support the development of private enterprises, including: 1. A reduction to corporate taxes and fees. Xi called for “increased tax reduction efforts, and substantial cuts to taxes included [including] VAT...\" 5. Build a new, more cordial relationship between government and business, and promote the healthy development of the non-public economy and the healthy growth of non-public entities.  It may be difficult to perceive whether these policy initiatives will be carried out in full, or even substantially, but it is possible that the Chinese entrepreneurial spirit may lead to another period of faster economic growth for this country. (Note, there is a good deal more in this commentary than I have presented.) The bottom line, though, is that this one survey remains below 50, and we have bad news on profits, from China\\'s news agency Xinhua. Corporate profits drop year-on-year Another interesting point is how, in the way of publicists everywhere, Xinhua headlines the good news, with the bad news buried as shown:  China\\'s industrial profits up 11.8 pct in first 11 months BEIJING, Dec. 27 (Xinhua) -- Earning growth at China\\'s industrial firms in November increased in the first 11 months with improved profitability and lower costs... In November, combined profits at industrial firms with annual revenue of more than 20 million yuan (about 2.89 million U.S. dollars) fell 1.8 percent year on year to 594.75 billion yuan, compared with an increase of 3.6 percent recorded in October... NBS official He Ping attributed the slowdown in November to slower growth in industrial production and product prices, as well as a high comparative base last year. \\n I\\'m not clear on how the assertion of greater profitability fits with declining profits yet higher sales yoy. A more hard-headed, market-oriented report on this comes from Bloomberg, which ran the headline: China\\'s Industrial Profits Drop for First Time Since 2015.  Zero Hedge shows this chart, which is relevant to US cycles: \\n\\nZH also shows a chart casting doubt on whether profits have fallen as little as reported, or matters are worse than China says. Accepting the data at face value, look how the black profits line has led the US economy and markets. It dropped to negative around mid-2014, and was mostly negative until about the end of 2015, then surged. Meanwhile, US economic data and markets acted similarly, but with a lag. Thus I look at the November drop to negativity as being consistent with at least a period of slower growth in the US, just as occurred beginning in 2015, with the SPY topping and dropping into Q1 2016. Reuters reports on this same data, suggesting difficult times ahead for China:  “Soft economic indicators such as producer prices, industrial output and orders all point to further pressure on corporate profitability,” said Nie Wen, a Shanghai-based analyst at Hwabao Trust, adding that firms’ revenues have been hit by shrinking demand. “Industrial profits next year might very well post a 5-10 percent decline on average.”  Note: detailed information on November data is found at China\\'s NBS. China\\'s markets suggest caution Given all this, I look at the chart of FXI with some fear of a falling knife in the US markets: \\n\\nFXI data by YCharts\\nThe above 10-year chart shows China leading the US markets coming out of the Great Recession, then tracking it. The greater strengths of the US probably account for the outperformance of the SPY from 2012 onward. That said, in 2015, FXI peaked ahead of the SPY, and its subsequent and rapid drop into bear market territory gave warnings of a weak market performance for the SPY. This year, FXI is down about 20% while at $246, SPY is down about 9%. Might that tend to imply more challenges in 2019 for the US economy and the SPY? I think it\\'s worth following this relationship. Summary The large, diverse Chinese economy may be liberalizing. If so, China could become an even more potent force in the global economy. But change could come more slowly than President Xi hopes, if at all. For now, China\\'s economy appears to be under challenge. Given some tendency to lead the US a bit, the sharp sell-off in US markets can be seen as part of a continuum. Also, some early signs of a US economic slowdown seen in such metrics as December\\'s Richmond Fed manufacturing index and the K.C. Fed manufacturing index may also be best seen in context of a global phenomenon that inextricably involves China. Submitted Thursday pre-market, SPY $242.20, 10-year Treasury 2.75%.

As healthcare spending grows, so too will demand for the company's buildings and its ability to grow.\"], 'article': ['HCP (HCP) is a $12.8 billion dividend aristocrat that focuses on real estate serving the healthcare industry. The company currently offers investors a very respectable dividend yield of more than 5.5% and that should only grow going forward. As we will see throughout this article, the company\\'s operation in a growing industry and strong financials make the company a strong investment. \\n\\n HCP Investor Presentation HCP Portfolio Overview HCP has an incredibly strong portfolio, which is the source of its cash flow. \\n\\n HCP Overview - HCP Investor Presentation HCP has an incredibly strong diversified portfolio with 19 million sq. ft. of medical offices and 7 million sq. ft. of life science properties. On top of this, the company has an astounding 29,500 senior housing units. Overall, the company\\'s astounding 775 properties give the company a $21 billion enterprise value and a $13 billion market cap. The company is a member of the S&P 500 and has a 5.4% dividend yield, with 33 years as a public company. The company has an incredibly strong investment grade balance sheet with a stable outlook.\\n \\n\\n HCP Market Position - HCP Investor Presentation Overall, the company has a $21 billion slice of a $1.1 trillion healthcare real estate market. Public REITs control roughly $150 billion of the entire market. This shows how HCP has a small slice of an incredibly large market, which shows HCP\\'s growth opportunity going forward. More so, this shows how the company has ample room to grow, which will allow the company to provide shareholders with additional cash flow. HCP Strategic Repositioning Now that we\\'ve seen how HCP operates in a huge market, let\\'s continue by discussing the company\\'s strategic repositioning. The company has had some difficulties recently, as the largest operator of its properties has struggled, and the company has worked hard to come back from those difficulties. \\n\\n HCP Asset Sales - HCP Investor Presentation HCP spun-off its riskiest SNF and HCR ManorCare assets into a company called QCP or quality control properties. That spin off, while initially seeming like a poor decision, was acquired earlier this year by Welltower Inc. (NYSE:WELL). The $4.4 billion acquisition was a large one and rewarded shareholders with a significant double-digit premium. In 2017, the company sold additional assets and focused on debt sales and repayments to improve its financial position. In 2018, the company continued additional steps to sell assets and improve its financial position. Overall, since 2016, the company has significantly refocused and improved the strength of its overall asset portfolio.\\n \\n\\n HCP Portfolio Change - HCP Investor Presentation In terms of additional updates, HCP is under contract to sell the massive Shoreline Tech Center in Mountain View for $1.0 billion. The company has also closed on a $605 million JV transaction and completed transactions from Brookdale to new operators. The company\\'s large JV with Brookdale means the ability to undertake new opportunities. The company has sold a variety of assets worth billions over the past years. The company should realize another $400 million from selling the remainder of its U.K. holdings in 2019. This overall shows the company\\'s focus on refocusing and improving the strength of its portfolio. HCP Growth Potential On top of this strategic repositioning, which should improve the company\\'s position, the company has strong growth potential going forward. \\n\\n HCP Organic Spend - HCP Investor Presentation At the same time, HCP has focused on organic development spend. Organic development spend should enable the company to significantly improve its portfolio and growth going forward. The company is targeting 2019-2021 spending of $300-400 million per year. That large amount of spending is equivalent to 5% of the company\\'s market cap. That means, as projects regularly come online, the company\\'s cash flow should start increasing at a regular clip of 5%. Currently, the company has an active development pipeline valued at more than $800 million. The company\\'s portfolio here is almost entirely spread through California and contains more than 1.2 million leasable square feet. The company has already managed to lease 83% of the properties, meaning cash flow should be reliable.\\n These projects have startup dates ranging from next year to year-end 2022, with the year-end 2022 project the only one not fully leased already. These projects together should provide the company with $63 million in steady annual cash flow, representing a 7.5-8.0% yield on the company\\'s assets. That\\'s a strong yield that the company can turn into shareholder returns. \\n\\n HCP Internal Development - HCP Investor Presentation More so, the company also has significant potential in earnings from redeveloping its current portfolio. The company anticipates that its portfolio has approximately $100+ million per year in redevelopment potential over the next few years. The company is targeting average cash-on-cash returns of 9- 12% on these projects. This significant redevelopment potential should provide the company with fairly unrisked $9-12 million in annual cash flow. The company\\'s current dividend obligations are roughly $350 million, which means redevelopment will be enough for the company to increase its dividend by 3-4% annually, not counting new projects. \\n\\n HCP Oyster Point Development - HCP Investor Presentation A good example of the company\\'s ability to create value is the company\\'s development known as \"The Cove at Oyster Point\". The total development was an astounding $789 million and created almost a million square feet in leasable space. Phase 3 and 4 of the projects are still under active development but are 100% leased.\\n Phase 1 and 2 of the project are already fully occupied. Together, all 4 phases are expected to bring in an astounding $63 million in annual cash flow. For a project with $789 million in costs, that is an incredibly strong annual cash flow generation for the company. HCP Financials On top of HCP incredible portfolio, strategic repositioning, and growth potential, the company has improved to an incredibly strong financial position. \\n\\n HCP Debt - HCP Investor Presentation HCP has $5.8 billion in total debt with an incredibly low 3.9% weighted average interest rate. That means the company\\'s interest expenses are fairly minimal at $230 million per year. The company\\'s weighted average maturity is 6.0 years, with most of its debt not due until the mid-2020s. That means that the company has ample room to refinance its debt. Alternatively, the company comfortably has room to pay down its debt in a few years should it choose too. \\n\\n HCP Historic Dividend - NASDAQ Looking at the company\\'s dividend history, HCP was forced to cut its dividend in 2016, due to difficulties, and since then, the company has kept its dividend constant. However, I believe that the company will soon resume its history of increasing dividends, with the goal of becoming a dividend aristocrat again. Given the company already yields more than 5% when it starts to resume increases that should reward shareholders well. HCP Valuation Now that we\\'ve discussed the strength of HCP overall, let\\'s continue by discussing the company\\'s valuation.\\n \\n\\n HCP Historic Yield - Macro Trends Valuing HCP as a company is hard, however, to value the company, it\\'s important to keep in mind why you\\'re investing in it. The appeal in investing the company comes from its dividend yield. Up until the company\\'s SNF issues that led to the QCP spin-off, the company was a dividend aristocrat; however, the issues resulting hurt its yield. However, minus that the company\\'s yield has normally hovered around 5%, if not a bit lower. That means that the company\\'s current dividend yield of 5.3% is a bit above the average, showing that the company is trading at a fair valuation. We also discussed the company\\'s plan to invest 300-400 million/year which will lead to $30 million or so new cash flow annually. That means going forward, the company\\'s cash flow will be increasing enough annually to increase its dividend by the mid-single digits, a respectable increase, and well above its historical rate of dividend increases when it was a dividend aristocrat. Overall, we can see that the company trades at a fairly low valuation based on its growth potential. More importantly, the company is in a strong spot meaning it\\'s incredibly likely a 2016 dividend cut situation happens again. This undervalued nature of the company helps to highlight it as a strong investment decision going forward. Going forward I would expect the company\\'s stock price to drop some, putting its dividend yield back to the 5% average range. I expect mid-single digit increases for the next few years as the company gets back on track, subsequently changing to high-single digit yields. These things show the return potential of HCP for those who invest today. Conclusion HCP has had a difficult time since 2016, as one of its largest tenants ran into a tough financial position. The company spun off the non-performing assets in QCP, which was acquired earlier this year at a 65% premium, rewarding shareholders who had held on to the company.\\n Currently, the company has stopped increasing its dividend, however, its cash flow is growing going forward. The company\\'s financial position is strong, with low-cost debt, and the company should be able to increase its dividend going forward. As a result, these things make the company a great investment.\\nDisclosure: I am/we are long HCP. I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions. I am not receiving compensation for it (other than from Seeking Alpha). I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article.']}\n"

I also observed the stock from a technical perspective, arguing that the selling was not yet done, and there was still more downside to go. In this article, I discuss why Nvidia\\'s technical setup and depressed valuation now make the company\\'s stock a strong, long-term buy at these levels. I will also highlight comments from the company and a few of its peers to determine why a trough could soon be in the cards. Reviewing the Technicals Back in late November, I had taken a look at Nvidia from a technical standpoint, noting a number of negative indicators that had accumulated in the month of October, preceding the majority of the stock\\'s decline. On the day of my article\\'s release, the stock had closed at $153, and my overall assessment was that NVDA had run into technical support at $140, which could open up the possibility for a near-term bounce. However, I was of the view that there was too much negative sentiment in the stock for that support to hold, and ultimately I believed NVDA would find its way to $120.\\n \\n\\n Chart used in my last article on NVDA, dated November 23, 2018. (Source: Seeking Alpha; originally from StockCharts.com) My assessment looks to have played out nicely so far, as the stock managed to run up to prior technical support (now resistance) at $175 before the bears came back in. I\\'ll say that being correct leaves somewhat of a bittersweet taste, considering I\\'m currently long the stock. \\n\\n (Source: StockCharts.com) So NVDA is currently trading at just over $133, having gone for as low as $125 in today\\'s trading session. It\\'s possible the stock still has a bit lower to go after its most recent technical breakdown. There is also a lack of near-term name-specific catalysts to take the stock higher, with the next one being the company\\'s Q4FY19 earnings report in February of 2019. I do, however, remain confident in Nvidia\\'s long-term prospects across a range of rapidly growing industries including gaming, datacenter, and autonomous vehicles. As such, I still believe that the $120 level will offer a strong floor of technical support for NVDA, and that after a massive 54% decline, the vast majority of negative sentiment has already been priced in. Overall, the viability of this support level remains contingent on whether the company can correct the near-term inventory buildup issues it had reported in its most recent quarter, as well as on Q4 results coming in above consensus estimates without a decline in forward guidance expectations.\\n \\n\\n (Source: StockCharts.com) Before pulling the trigger to buy NVDA, I would watch to see if the stock can find meaningful buyers and form a base as it approaches the $120 level as confirmation of technical support. My ultimate indicator of when to turn bullish would be to see the stock break out above the downtrend line it formed at the start of October. In the event of a weak Q4 report and a definitive break below $120, I would look to lower my target to the next level of technical support at around the $95-100 price range. Valuation Update Since the stock\\'s peak on October 1st, NVDA has experienced a monumental 54% decline in the span of less than 3 months, turning what was an YTD gain of 50% to a loss of over 31%. The stock\\'s valuation metrics have taken an even worse beating, as highlighted in the chart below: \\n\\nNVDA data by YCharts I had pointed out in my last article that a relatively small drop in expected future earnings growth, due to the oversupply of inventory that the company reported in its most recent quarter, was the main culprit in Nvidia\\'s precipitous decline in price and valuation. For much of 2018, Nvidia was trading at P/E multiples in the 40s and 50s, but is now trading for just under 17.5 times earnings for the first time since 2015. I feel that the stock is now attractively priced, especially considering the company\\'s forward earnings growth, which is reflected by a PEG ratio of just 1.23.\\n Peer Comparison I had also discussed in my last coverage of Nvidia how the company\\'s stock was in the midst of a re-rating of its valuation that would bring it more in line with that of its major semiconductor peers; in this case, Intel (INTC), Texas Instruments (TXN), and Qualcomm (QCOM). I\\'ll mention again that the latter had historically traded at multiples similar to those of its large-cap peers prior to its legal battle with Apple (AAPL). On the P/E side, while the chip sector as a whole has experienced a significant deflation in valuation throughout much of the year, the decline for Nvidia has been especially steep. The company now sports a P/E ratio lower than both Qualcomm and Texas Instruments; this despite seeing much higher growth in expected earnings for next year than each of its aforementioned peers: \\n\\nNVDA PE Ratio (TTM) data by YCharts\\n\\nNVDA EPS Estimates for Next Fiscal Year data by YCharts The company\\'s P/S ratio still remains higher than that of its major peers, even after a ~60% decline from its peak in early 2018. However, this is not much of a concern due to the company carrying larger profit margins on its sales. \\n\\nNVDA PS Ratio (TTM) data by YCharts\\n\\nNVDA Profit Margin (TTM) data by YCharts\\n Overall, based on the company\\'s valuation metrics, I am convinced that Nvidia offers quality and long-term growth at a now very reasonable value. Nvidia\\'s compelling valuation, coupled with its improving technical picture, leads me to believe that the stock is a strong, long-term buy at these levels. What the Company and Its Peers are Saying For some clarity regarding a possible time period for a bottom, I would point to what Nvidia and a different group of peers, namely Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), Applied Materials (AMAT), and Micron (MU), have been saying in their recent quarterly earnings reports. Similarly to Nvidia, these companies have experienced significant drawdowns in their stocks over the last few months: \\n\\nNVDA data by YCharts Looking into commentary from each of the four companies in their most recent reports, there appears to be much consensus with regards to the direction of the overall chip market in 2019: Nvidia - CFO commentary, Q3FY19 earnings: Revenue was $3.18 billion, up 21 percent year over year and up 2 percent sequentially. Three of our market platforms - Professional Visualization, Datacenter, and Automotive - posted record revenue. Gaming revenue was short of our expectations, and our fourth quarter outlook is impacted by excess channel inventory of midrange Pascal products. We believe this is a near-term issue that will be corrected in one to two quarters, and remain confident in our competitive position and market opportunities. AMD - CEO Lisa Su, Q3 earnings call: So, the first half of the year was very strong for graphics. I think the first half of 2019 will not be very strong for graphics. But we have a number of product launches coming up, and we\\'re pretty excited about some of those product launches. And so, I would view that - we need to work off some of this channel inventory that\\'s in place, and then go back to sort of a more typical seasonality, which would see the second half stronger than the first.\\n Applied Materials - CEO Gary Dickerson, commentary on memory chip market conditions in Q4 earnings call: In recent months, however, we\\'ve seen several factors negatively impacting industry spending. These include elevated macroeconomic risks, global trade tensions and specific to our industry, a pullback in memory investments. Recent commentary by memory makers has painted a consistent picture. Overall demand in the server, PC and mobile markets is weaker than it was earlier in the year and memory prices are softening in the near term. Our customers tell us they expect demand to pick up and pricing to stabilize in the second half of 2019. Micron - CEO Sanjay Mehrotra on last week\\'s Q1 earnings call: Looking beyond fiscal Q3, as we enter the second half of calendar 2019, we expect a healthier demand environment alongside an improved industry supply picture, which should contribute to improved financial performance. I\\'ll point out that Applied Materials and Micron are more on the memory side of the chip sector as opposed to Nvidia and AMD which are more in the GPU space. However, the four companies serve very similar end markets, and thus are highly correlated with each other. For this reason, I find it notable that the managements of all four companies seem to be indicating that the chip cycle will hit its trough by the end of 1H19. \\n\\n NAND Flash Price Change, 2017-2018. (Source: FlashBay) \\n\\n\\n (Source: Statista) I would expect the bottom for the stocks themselves to come in sometime before that, however, as expectations for improved future guidance would provide a bullish catalyst for the overall sector. As such, I would estimate that a decisive bottom for the broader chip sector, and therefore Nvidia, would turn up in early- to mid-1H19. Conclusion Just as investor sentiment in the stock of Nvidia had overshot to the upside as it approached $300 in late September, I am of the view that sentiment is now overshooting to the downside with this decline. As NVDA approaches $120, I believe that the market is pricing in very low expectations for the next two quarters, without looking out beyond to the company\\'s longer-term growth prospects. For long-term investors who are willing to stomach near-term volatility, Nvidia offers a very compelling risk/reward at these levels, and ideally I will look to add to my position (currently at a cost basis of ~$102) in early 2019.\\nDisclosure: I am/we are long NVDA, AMAT, INTC, TXN.

Furthermore, as a result of having officially been part of the UK government for almost 497 years, it continues to take advantage of the infrastructure that was established on its behalf during this period and also the confidence that has been built up in its services over the centuries. This fact, combined with the company\\'s innovative attitude since being privatised suggests that the group is a great investment for anybody with a long-term mindset. A National Institution All Royal Mail stamps still consist of an image of the Queen. This may seem trivial, but it certainly begins to demonstrate that Royal Mail has maintained its link with the state, albeit with the added benefits of being a private company. One way in which this link with the government is useful is the fact that Royal Mail is embedded into the laws of the country. For example, the Electoral Commission entitles candidates in British parliamentary elections to mail a manifesto leaflet to local voters, free of charge. Who is the company statutorily responsible for posting these campaign mail-outs? Royal Mail, of course! Additionally, government agencies almost exclusively use Royal Mail for official purposes. The Home Office, for example, uses Royal Mail to securely post passports and other documents to their owners.  This dependence of the government on Royal Mail will ensure steady profits for many years to come, even if letter volume as a whole is falling. Royal Mail was the company traditionally used before it was privatised and the government currently has no reason to change to an alternative and potentially untrustworthy postage provider. \\n It\\'s not just the state which depends on Royal Mail. Companies in the UK are also very aware that the facilities offered by Royal Mail (e.g. letterboxes all around the country) allow their customers to contact and transact with them more easily. Many companies have even purchased \"Freepost\" addresses to enable customers to contact them without having to pay for postage. No Lack Of Innovation Despite having previously been part of the infrastructure of the UK government, there is no lack of innovation within the culture of the newly privatised Royal Mail. The company recently announced that it would be deploying electric trucks and vans across the whole country in order to reduce its carbon footprint. It\\'s also investigating the use of letter boxes for posting parcels. One application of this would be that online sellers would no longer have to visit a Post Office in order to post their products to customers. They could instead choose to post them at a network of more than 100,000 postboxes around the UK (another example of the vast infrastructure owned by Royal Mail as a result of its past links to the government). The company has also shown its innovative side by developing partnerships with large postal carriers around the world and has worked with these partners (which include USPS and Japan Post) to allow items sent abroad through their network to be tracked and monitored - even when the items are overseas. Powerful Dividend Companies in the UK typically do pay higher dividends than those in the US and Royal Mail is no exception. An added bonus of buying shares in Royal Mail is that the company currently has a dividend yield of 8.66%, partially due to its currently depressed share price - some have attributed this to temporary Brexit uncertainty. \\n\\nROYMY Dividend Yield (NYSE:TTM) data by YCharts\\nLow Valuation Based On Fundamentals Royal Mail has a price-to-earnings ratio of just 10.83x, low when considered alongside the wider UK market with P/Es closer to 14x. The company also has a price-to-book value of 0.63, meaning that it is trading at less than asset value, and that there is therefore a considerable margin of safety were anything to go badly wrong with the company in the future. The company\\'s balance sheet also shows that it has very low levels of debt and a healthy amount of cash which it can use to fund further research and development. Conclusion When buying shares in Royal Mail you are effectively buying a stake in a UK government agency (although really you are buying shares in a private company). The fact that the government is so dependent on Royal Mail as a result of their historical relationship means that Royal Mail is an excellent investment opportunity over the next 5-15 years and I would certainly promote the idea of establishing a position in this British company.\\nDisclosure: I/we have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

(See my most recent article.).\\n        This proposal addresses these regulators’ concerns.\\n        '], 'article': ['Whatever the reasons, since the transition of market trading from voice to electronic trading, the existing stock EMFs, Intercontinental Exchange (ICE), Nasdaq (NDAQ), and CBOE global markets (CBOE), and dark pools (financial institution-owned trading platforms) have seemingly reached a state of arrested development. This arrested development shows in the absence of new products. Platforms for trading existing financial instruments are proliferating, but since the advent of ETFs, there has been little innovation in the instruments themselves. The marketplaces for securities trading are basically numerous clones of Joshua Levine’s Island trading platform. As a result of dark pool competition, the market share of the major EMFs is in decline. Here, I suggest a joint innovation: an exchange that both lists and originates instruments designed by the exchange itself; a way the exchange can originate instruments of its own choosing. This form of exchange permits a market sector to decide for itself the structure of the instruments the sector needs for risk management purposes. Marketplaces have gotten stuck. We have reached a kind of plateau in improving the structure of financial markets. Most new marketplaces are dark pools, designed originally to seduce the buy-side with the promise of protection from high frequency traders (HFTs), a promise honored largely in the breach as frequent litigation demonstrates. Later, the dark pools became one of the ways broker-dealers process orders received from internet retail brokers like TD Ameritrade (AMTD), promising improvements on the prices of the Securities Information Processor (SIP), the SEC’s poor reflection of current market prices. SIP prices are so poor that these broker-dealers can pay fees for the business sent to them by retail brokers, improve on the SIP prices, and still make a profit. Firms like Virtu (VIRT) are rapidly expanding their fee-for-execution services into markets other than common shares.\\n But there is room for improvement in the things we trade.  The trading of common shares has been revolutionized by market index mutual funds, market index exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and stock market index futures. While these developments are not the final answer to the implementation of the revolution in stock market risk management based on the work of Markowitz, Sharpe, and others, there is nothing new on the horizon of efficient trading of stock market portfolios. But debt trading languishes in the past. While there are debt ETFs and debt mutual funds, they have not enjoyed the success of stock index-based instruments. There are multiple reasons. For example, large debtors are not always blue-chip borrowers. Nonetheless, there are several successful passively managed bond funds, mostly Vanguard products. These funds meet customer needs for diversified-risk, low-cost, bond investments; where the change in market value is most important. What is wrong with the debt market? One key problem in the debt market is that the purposes of debt acquisition are not, as with stock, always the balancing of risk and return. Insurance companies, for example, buy bonds because they seek a predictable series of receipts to match their predictable series of policy payments. Thus, bond issuers, through their investment banking advisors, market to two primary constituencies: investment companies like Vanguard that seek to design bond index funds used to manage risk and return; and insurance companies, pension funds, and other wholesale institutional money managers that seek predictable income payments. This second class of bond buyers is limited to buying individual issues – thus saddled with all the vagaries of the decision-making process of a single issuer. See this article on General Electric (GE) debt for a cautionary example of a stumbling issuer. To list the basic needs of bond traders:  A single instrument that simultaneously serves as an index of bond risks and returns for some investors; and as a fixed series of low-risk predictable payments for others. An instrument with yields exceeding Treasury debt but with lower risk than any single corporate long-term debt issue. An instrument whose payments may not be held hostage by a single issuer. \\n How to fix the debt market. This article provides a summary description of a new kind of financial instrument with a new kind of exchange upon which to trade it. A more lengthy explanation is available here. (Look on the Financial Market Microstructure page, \"A PowerPoint presentation of Exchange Originated Instruments.\") Liquidity is achieved in the stock market, and to a lesser degree with debt index funds, by dramatically reducing the risks specific to a single issue. That method works almost flawlessly in the stock market since the lion’s share of publicly held corporations issue a dominant single common stock with a price that reflects corporate success. Thus, combining individual shares, weighted by their share of total market value, produces a portfolio that reliably reflects the value of the entire stock market, with very little need to conduct expensive transactions to keep the portfolio on track. The bond market is more complicated than the stock market since a large corporation usually issues multiple bonds. These bonds are also managed in the interest of the stockholders of the issuing corporation. Bonds are often retired, for example, when their coupon yields exceed market yields. Individual bond values are affected by such specifics as seniority. There is a bias in the bond market against the bondholder – in favor of the bond issuer. If a change in bond policy benefits the issuer, it will invariably work against the bondholder. As a result, issuer decisions often work against the interests of bondholders. In other words, the unpredictability of the payments to be received from a bond is an enemy of the bond’s value to the bondholder. To improve the predictability of a bond, these improvements would be useful:  Let bondholders determine the terms of the bond. Have an intermediary that represents bondholders create modified issues that meet bondholder needs. That change would assure that the resulting modified bonds wouldn’t be altered to suit individual issuers. For example, bondholders could delegate the daily composition of the assets supporting a bond to an investment manager, an agent of the exchange, without affecting the bond’s payments. The debt issuers that support a given bond could be selected daily by this agent. The issuers would logically be the highest quality names, widely diversified, to be altered daily at the agent’s discretion. Let traders that choose to take bond ownership (buy and hold) receive a known set of payments that would be unaffected (except for seismic events in the market for debt as a whole) by decisions of the manager of the debt instruments supporting the bond. Let traders that choose to go long the bond, seeking to obtain the bond’s portfolio risk and return properties, gain access to a derivative instrument that is immune to liquidity problems of the underlying debt. This could be accomplished through the use of futures exchange-like margining methods. Margin payments and receipts would produce the risk/return profile of any desirable bond index with lower expense ratios than the bond index mutual funds. \\n The performance of these bond-like instruments would be designed to meet bondholder needs, not original issuer needs. Bondholder representation. The biggest barrier to developing a space in the bond market designed for bondholders instead of corporate issuers is a deadly combination of buy-side lethargy and sell-side aggressive protection of its historical turf, the financial marketplace. Johnny-come-lately firms such as the HFT/fund management firms, like Citadel and Virtu, pose a threat to sell-side turf in their early years; but are soon co-opted by the established broker-dealers. One alternative that would not be so easily co-opted by sell-side money would be a new, different, exchange. Such an exchange could return to the ethos of the Twentieth Century exchange – a membership organization that could choose its own membership and reassumes the self-regulatory habits of the exchanges of this earlier time.

Other competitors are trading at 10-209x sales, so HEXO should be trading at more than 32x sales. Keep in mind that the revenue growth of HEXO seems larger than that of other competitors. With that, once the shares trade on the NYSE, many more investors will assess the company. There should be an increase in the amount of liquidity in the market, which usually leads to an increase in the share price. \\n\\n Source: F-10 Filing Business Founded in 2013, Ontario-based HEXO seems to be a very early entrant player in medical cannabis industry, which investors should appreciate. HEXO commenced selling medical marijuana in May 2015 and was the first licensed producer in Quebec. With the industry being young, those companies, like HEXO, which produced and sold cannabis from the beginning should have accumulated a large amount of know-how. It will represent a barrier to the entry of new competitors.\\n As of today, the company bills itself as a vertically integrated consumer company, not only producing medical cannabis but also operating in the new adult-use cannabis market. The company has two brands, \"HEXO,\" which is the adult-use cannabis brand, and Hydropothecary, the medical cannabis brand. The company\\'s website presents these two marks with the lines shown below: \\n\\n Source: Company\\'s Website \\n\\n Source: Company\\'s Website The amount of facilities equals approximately 310,000 square feet, and it should own an additional one million square feet of greenhouse space by the end of 2018. In addition, the expected annual production estimate is equal to 0.108 kg. The lines below provide further details on this matter and on the manufacturing facilities: \\n\\n Source: F-10 Filing HEXO is also pursuing other business opportunities that should help the company grow. It entered into a joint venture with Molson Coors Brewing Company (TAP) to develop non-alcoholic, cannabis-infused beverages in Canada. The market should appreciate this new initiative very much. Keep in mind that additional products should increase the revenue line and business growth.\\n Those investors, who don\\'t know HEXO, should take a look at this name. The fact that it traded over-the-counter in the United States should not worry the market. Take into account that the company expects to have forward sales that are comparable to that of American companies like Canopy (OTC:CGC) and Aurora (OTC:ACB). This means that HEXO is poised to become a very serious competitor and have well-known stock after the shares trade on NYSE. The image below provides further details on this matter: \\n\\n Source: F-10 Filing Large Market Opportunity Only in Canada, the target market size seems to be very large. According to Statistics Canada, Canadians acquired approximately 760,000 kg of cannabis worth CAD 5.7 billion in 2017. Most of this material was purchased from illegal sources. In addition, research published by New Frontier Data notes that domestic Canadian cannabis market should reach CAD 9.2 billion by 2025. In addition, New Frontier Data notes that medical marijuana market in Canada should be worth CAD 2.35 billion in 2025. Solid Financial Situation As of October 31, 2018, with an asset/liability ratio of 22x, cash of CAD 23 million, short-term investments of CAD 148 million, and total assets of CAD 383 million, the amount of liquidity seems very beneficial. It will be very useful for the construction of new facilities and the development of new products. The image below provides further details on this matter: \\n\\n\\n Source: 10-Q The amount of total liabilities is very small, equal to CAD 17.4 million. The image below provides further details on the list of liabilities: \\n\\n Source: 10-Q Income Statement The revenue growth is quite impressive. For the three months ended October 31, 2018, the company reported CAD 6.6 million, 502% more than that in the same time period in 2017. The gross margin seems also quite overwhelming. The gross margin before fair value adjustments was equal to CAD 2.83 million. In addition, HEXO reported an increase in the value of its biological assets, which made the total gross margin equal to CAD 7.2 million. Investors should not expect this level of gross margin in the future as the market price of the company\\'s inventory may not increase in every quarter. The image below provides further details on this matter: \\n\\n Source: 10-Q The company expends a large amount of money in marketing and promotion, CAD 11.7 million, which represents 53% of the total amount of operating expenses. The stock-based compensations equal to CAD 4.6 million should not worry investors. Most emerging companies in the cannabis industry are making use of their stock to pay expenses. The loss from operations was equal to -CAD 14.7 million and the net income losses were equal to -CAD 12.8 million. The image below provides the bottom line from the income statement: \\n\\n\\n Source: 10-Q Use Of Proceeds HEXO is expected to sell shares up to an aggregate of $800 million in the next 25 months. It seems beneficial that HEXO will not use the proceeds to pay existing shareholders. The proceeds will be used for general corporate purposes, paying the company\\'s international expansion among other purposes. The lines below provide further details on this matter:    The Company may from time to time during the 25-month period that this Prospectus, including any amendments hereto, remains valid, offer for sale and issue up to an aggregate of $800,000,000 in Securities hereunder.   Among other potential uses, the Company may use the net proceeds from the sale of Securities for general corporate purposes, including funding ongoing operations and/or working capital requirements, to repay indebtedness outstanding from time to time, capital projects and potential future acquisitions, including in relation to international expansion.\"  Source: F-10 Filing   Valuation As of October 25, 2018, the company reported 197 million shares with 34 million warrants and $14 million options. In this regard, the number of convertible securities does not seem large. Other emerging companies in the cannabis space show many more warrants, options, and convertible preferred stock. With that, shareholders should be careful as these securities could create stock dilution and push the share price of the stock down. The table below provides further details on this matter: \\n\\n Source: Business Presentation As of December 23, 2018, assuming 246 million shares at $3.18, the market capitalization should be $782 million. Deducting cash of $134 million, the total enterprise value should be $648 million. With $4.8 million revenues made in the three months ended October 31, 2018, assuming forward revenues of $20 million seems reasonable. With this figure in mind, the company trades at 32x sales.\\n Other competitors trading on the NYSE seem to have a large valuation as compared to HEXO. As shown in the image below, they trade at 10-209x sales:\\n\\n Source: YCharts - EV/Sales Taking into account the most recent increase in its quarterly earnings, HEXO should be trading at a higher valuation. While most competitors reported revenue growth of 37-186%, revenue growth of HEXO is higher. The image below provides further details on this matter: \\n\\n Source: YCharts - Revenue Growth It is obvious that HEXO should not trade at 209x sales like Tilray, Inc. (TLRY), which seems to be the most expensive competitor. However, HEXO should now trade at 32x sales with Aurora trading at 74x sales and Cronos trading at 209x sales. With this in mind, HEXO seems undervalued at $3.18 per share. With that, a very serious stock catalyst is expected soon. If the company can sell its shares on the NYSE, many more investors will review and get to know the company. Keep in mind that many funds cannot acquire shares in Canada or trade in the OTC Markets. As a result, the amount of liquidity for HEXO should increase, which usually leads to an increase in the stock demand and a price increase. Because of this reason, it seems a great moment to study HEXO, before more market participants in the United States do it. Conclusion With massive revenue growth and trading on the NYSE in near future, HEXO seems to represent, right now, an interesting opportunity. The company seems undervalued at 32x sales with other competitors trading at 10-209x sales. Once the shares trade on the NYSE, many more investors will assess the company, which should increase the amount of liquidity in the market. With this in mind, buying HEXO right before NYSE investors are able to grab shares seems an appealing investment strategy.\\n With the market declining in December, acquiring shares of HEXO could be a bit risky right now. Keep in mind that cannabis companies usually show large share price volatility. That\\'s the biggest risk on this name.\\nDisclosure: I/we have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

Group revenues rose 16% to $7.91 billion but missed analysts\\' forecasts of $8.02 billion. But the real damage came from Micron’s guidance. Micron said current quarter sales would slump to between $5.7 billion and $6.3 billion and noted that gross margins would narrow to between 50% and 53%. David Zinsner - SVP and CFO of MU during the company\\'s earnings call noted: \"As we enter calendar 2019, we are seeing weakening demand from our customers. As a result, we are taking decisive actions, including a meaningful reduction in our fiscal 2019 CapEx plan, in both DRAM and NAND that will materially reduce our supply bit growth.\" But we knew this would happen, didn’t we? Anyone who read my February 20, 2018 Seeking Alpha article entitled “5 Warning Signs The Memory Super Cycle Is Ending,” would have seen this coming. In the article, I noted that several factors: “...will result in a reduction in increases in ASPs of memory chips as supply-demand dynamics change. The surge in stocks for memory companies in 2017 was due to tight supply and high demand. As supply increases, the rampant increases in average selling prices we saw in 2017 will slow. Forecasts show that ASPs of NAND already have started dropping and ASPs of DRAM will begin in mid 2018. Because of the correlation in memory chip pricing and stock pricing, a correction in memory stocks is anticipated.”\\n In reality, Micron’s financial performance was not bad, just overblown by analysts with a series of downgrades from Needham and RBC Capital, as well as the Wall Street Journal’s Heard on the Street. Table 1 breaks out the company’s financials. According to the company’s 10-Q, \\n\\n Most importantly, Micron was profitable, with Gross Margins of 58% and Operating Profit Margins of 48%. MU’s overall gross margin percentage of 58% for FYQ1 2019 increased from 55% for the FYQ1 2018, primarily due to the introduction of products featuring advanced technologies, including 1Xnm DRAM and 64-layer 3D NAND, thereby enabling manufacturing cost reductions. The headwinds MU is currently facing and reported in the company\\'s recent earnings report should last only through 1H 2019, which I detailed in a December 3, 2018 Seeking Alpha article entitled “NAND And DRAM: An Upturn Is Closer Than We Think.” Comparing MU’s financials to Samsung and SK Hynix The following six charts present quarterly analysis for MU through FYQ1 2019 with those of Samsung Electronics (OTC:SSNLF) and SK Hynix (OTC:HXSCL) through their guided and consensus CYQ4 2018 financials. Chart 1 presents DRAM revenue data in graphical form. In the past three years shown in the chart, MU maintained its share of DRAM revenue, and stands to gain further in the recent quarter.  MU’s DRAM revenues dropped 9.1% Samsung’s are forecast to drop 12.4% and SK’s are forecast to drop 10.3%.  MU’s drop reflects decreases in average selling prices (ASPs) from challenging market conditions in enterprise and cloud server markets and graphics markets, partially offset by increases in sales of mobile products. \\n\\nChart 1\\n Chart 2 presents NAND revenue data in graphical form.  MU\\'s revenues dropped 0.5% QoQ while SK Hynix’ revenues are forecast to increase 1.1% and Samsung’s revenues are forecast to drop 30.8%.  \\n\\nChart 2 Chart 3 shows that Samsung gained significantly in DRAM bit shipments over SK Hynix and MU until the forecasted quarter. For the recent quarter,  MU\\'s DRAM bit shipments showed no change SK Hynix’ shipments are forecast to decrease 1.9% and Samsung’s shipments are forecast to decrease 4.0%.  The DRAM market has significantly shortened the over supply period compared to the past due to the oligopoly of supply and diversification of demand. After a short down cycle to 1H19, I expect the industry to re-enter the up cycle in 2H19 due to limited supply and demand improvement. \\n\\nChart 3 Table 2 shows DRAM Supply/Demand data for Q4 2018 and CY 2019. With cutbacks in capex spending that is projected to drop 26% in 2019, DRAM output will increase 16.7%, down from 20.7% growth in 2018. In 2018, the DRAM oversupply ratio will be positive, increasing to 0.6% from -0.7% in 2017. Because of cutbacks in capex, an undersupply situation will occur in 2019, as demand outstrips supply by 0.8%. \\n\\n\\n Chart 4 shows that NAND bit have been growing as new 3D NAND structures have developed. For the recent quarter,  MU\\'s NAND bit shipments increased 13.0% SK Hynix’ shipments are forecast to increase 22.4% and Samsung’s shipments are forecast to decrease 3.0%.  MU’s bit shipments of NAND products for the FY Q1 2019 increased 13% from the fourth quarter of 2018 despite declines in sales of SSD storage products as a result of pricing decreases, partially offset by higher shipment volumes of managed NAND products into mobile markets, which increased more than 50% due to our execution in delivering products featuring advanced 3D NAND technologies combined with strong customer acceptance. \\n\\nChart 4 Table 3 shows NAND Supply/Demand data for Q4 2018 and CY 2019. With cutbacks in capex spending that is projected in 2019, NAND output will increase 36.5%, down from 48.4% growth in 2018. In 2018, the NAND oversupply ratio will be positive, increasing to 2.8% from -2.7% in 2017. Because of cutbacks in capex, an oversupply situation will still occur in 2019, as supply outstrips demand by 3.2%. \\n\\n Chart 5 shows that MU’s DRAM operating profit margin improved in successive quarters compared to SK Hynix and Samsung, but in the current quarter, Micron’s operating profit is forecast to lead both companies. For the recent quarter,  MU\\'s DRAM operating profit margin was 63.2% SK Hynix’ OPM is forecast to increase to 60.9% and Samsung’s OPM is forecast to decrease to 62.6%. \\n Global DRAM demand will increase 18.4% in 2019 as demand for Server DRAM increases 35.7%, Smartphone increases 16.8%, and Notebook PC increases 6.0%. \\n\\nChart 5 Chart 6 shows that MU’s NAND operating profit margin improved quarterly, overtaking SK Hynix in 3Q 2017. For the recent quarter,  MU\\'s NAND operating profit margin (OPM) was 14.8% SK Hynix’ OPM is forecast to decrease to 11.0% and Samsung’s OPM is forecast to decrease to 36.4%.  Global NAND demand will increase 36.0% in 2019 as demand for SSD increases 45.6%, Smartphone increases 25.3%, Tablet PC increases 24.2%, TV increases 34.1%, and USB increases 27.6%. \\n\\nChart 6 Investor Takeaway After a two-year boom in the market, oversupply is weighing on DRAM and NAND flash chip prices amid weak consumer and business demand for phones and computers. Weaker memory demand than expected is causing a supply excess, resulting in falling memory chip prices. However, I pointed out in my previously mentioned Seeking Alpha article that semiconductor market conditions will start improving from the second half of 2019 at the latest. The oversupply of memory chips is resulting in decreased average selling prices, but price erosion will improve in Q4 2018 for NAND and Q1 2019 for DRAM. Although chip prices are dropping, bit growth of the memory chips is resulting in high revenues and margins for manufacturers. Although demand for smartphones is flat, and capex spend for cloud servers is slowing, increased memory content per device is growing strongly.\\n\\nDisclosure: I/we have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

Here is some of my commentary/analysis of the table from the initial article:    Given the initial data I wrote about earlier concerning the fact that Carnival didn\\'t appear to be particularly overvalued, under normal circumstances, I probably would have skipped it and just written about a different stock instead. But, even with only 30 years of data, there were a couple points with Carnival I noticed that were too interesting to not write about. The first is how each successive downturn took longer for Carnival to recover from. And the second is how each successive downturn Carnival dropped farther than it had in previous downturns... ...There was another interesting thing I noticed about Carnival during the course of this research and that is that Carnival usually leads the market lower a couple of years before a recession strikes. \\n Other than wanting to warn Carnival shareholders of the deep potential downside of the stock, one of the reasons I chose to write about Carnival at the time was that I found the tendency for Carnival stock to serve as a leading indicator for a bear market/recession very interesting. During each of the past three recessions, it had done so. In the original article, I also performed a risk/reward analysis for Carnival in which I forecast out three years\\' worth of expected price appreciation and dividends, then included the expected price decline if a recession occurred at the end of that time period. Here is some of that analysis:    After about three years, we can expect a total gain, including dividends, of about $49.44. If we add that to Carnival\\'s current price, we can expect a price of around $109.58 per share (over a 23% gain per year). Now the question becomes how far we might expect Carnival\\'s stock price to fall. Before the last two recessions, the stock price had been a bit overvalued on a historical p/e basis, and that doesn\\'t seem to be the case now. However, Carnival does seem to be suffering from deeper drawdowns. For these reasons, I\\'ll just provide a range that we might expect between 50-70%. That would give us a range between $32.87 and $54.79 if we have a bear market after three years. Since the entire range is below where the stock price trades today, I would avoid Carnival even though it doesn\\'t look especially overvalued at the moment.  Given the poor risk/reward for Carnival at the time, I suggested that investors would be wise to rotate out of Carnival and into SPLV: I think PowerShares S&P 500 Low-Volatility ETF (SPLV) would be a good alternative to Carnival, especially given Carnival\\'s slower growth rate during this recovery. The SPLV should be able to capture significant upside if the market moves higher, while also protecting against the downside. Here is how Carnival has performed against SPLV since the publication of the article. I have included (SPY) for reference as well:\\n \\n\\nCCL Total Return Price data by YCharts SPLV returned -2.17% while CCL lost -26.5%. An investor who got more defensive and rotated out of CCL back in April can now rotate back into Carnival and achieve an ~33% gain in shares at no extra cost. This is slightly above my target back in April: I think SPLV should contrast itself well against a stock like Carnival that is subject to big drops, and if a fan of Carnival stock were so inclined, they could rotate back into Carnival near the bottom of the cycle, and I think they would have the opportunity to own ~30% more shares. At this time, I consider this a completed successful trade for rotational investors. Now, let\\'s look at what might be a couple of good entry points for those investors who are waiting in cash or some other defensive investment (as I am). Weightings & Strategy For my cyclical investing strategy, I use a medium-term investment time frame, which has a maximum holding period of five years in most cases. For that reason, I usually only invest in companies that have a history of recovering from their price declines within five years. Due to the fact that Carnival struggled for over a decade to recover from the Great Recession, I put Carnival in the \"too hard\" in my previous article. Since then, Carnival bulls have convinced me to take another look at whether Carnival might have started a new secular bull era. Part of their argument is one of a generational shift where many GenXers who prefer more, let\\'s call them \\'organic\\' travel experiences, are being eclipsed by Millennials who have no qualms about handing over their travel experience to a corporation so long as they are getting a good value for their money. Mike Taylor\\'s discussion with Daniel Shvartsman in this SA podcast helped tilt my thinking in that direction.\\n Additionally, I have to say that virtually everyone I encounter who has gone on a cruise loved it. Just three weeks ago, I received even more reinforcement of this while staying at the Hilton in Galveston, Texas, which is a cruising departure port. I encountered several people, including families, who were preparing to leave on a cruise and a few who were returning. The excitement of those preparing to leave was palpable, and everyone returning had smiles on the faces. It\\'s hard to deny that more and more people enjoy the experience. Also, I\\'ve watched three interviews with Carnival\\'s CEO since my original article, and I\\'ve been extremely impressed. He knows his business well and seems to possess all the qualities I would want in a CEO. And, I think there is some quantitative evidence that Carnival might have started a secular bull. Carnival\\'s earnings are fairly volatile over an entire cycle, but what I want to do here is use F.A.S.T Graphs to focus on the earnings growth they had during the previous cycle leading up the Great Recession, from trough to peak. And then compare that to the current cycle\\'s uptrend. \\n\\nIn 2003, Carnival earned $1.66 per share for the year, and by the end of 2007, earnings had grown to $2.96 per share. This includes the entire upcycle for Carnival during this period. Now, let\\'s look at the current upcycle for Carnival that started in 2014: \\n\\n Interestingly, Carnival\\'s earnings per share actually bottomed at $1.58, lower than the previous cycle. But look how much stronger earnings were in the upcycle, whereas last cycle earnings peaked at $2.96, this cycle they have reached $4.26 per share (and we don\\'t know for sure, yet, if those are peak annual earnings). So, we\\'ve had much stronger growth off the bottom with regard to earnings. I think this does offer some evidence that a secular bull for Carnival might have started. While this doesn\\'t mean that it isn\\'t still cyclical. It is. What it does mean is that whereas before I didn\\'t think it was investable, even at cycle lows, because of its slow recovery time. I think this at least offers some evidence that the recovery time for the stock might not be as long going forward.\\n All that said, I still plan to require a good margin of safety before buying the stock, and historically, buying after a -50% decline from its peak price and a -70% would have done so, so those will be the entry points I\\'ll backtest. The table below shows the results one would have had they invested after a -50% decline in price during Carnival\\'s previous downturns. The returns in the table do not include dividends. I annualized the returns and then compared them to the S&P 500 if bought and sold on the same dates, annualized. The goal is to see if historically buying after a -50% decline would be an alpha-producing strategy, so the last column is the alpha produced by the investment annualized relative to the S&P 500. All the percentages should be treated as estimates and are based on the approximate months held. If one buys after a ~50% decline and sells after the stock makes a full recovery, it produces a ~100% simple return, so that is the simple return for each of the investments in the table below.   Year the Decline Began Purchase Date Sell Date Months Held Annualized Gains S&P 500 Annualized Gains Alpha to the S&P 500   1987 10/29/87 1/26/89 15 80.00% 15.34% 64.66%   1989 9/28/90 10/1/91 12 100.00% 27.14% 72.83%   1999 3/2/00 8/15/03 41 29.27% -8.28% 37.55%   2005 10/9/08 2/23/17 100 12.00% 19.18% -7.18%   Investing during the downturns in the 1980s and 1990s would have produced great alpha, but during the downturn that began in 2005 investing after a -50% decline would not have produced alpha and would have taken over 8 years to recover the 2005 highs. I prefer cyclical investments to take less than 5 years to recover and to produce alpha versus the S&P 500. Now, let\\'s look and see if making a second investment after a -70% decline would have helped the performance in 2005 decline. Investing after a -70% decline then selling after a full recovery produces about a 230% simple return, so that will be the simple return for the table below. I\\'ll also include a column that shows what the combined time-weighted alpha of both purchases would have been.\\n   Year the Decline Began Purchase Date Sell Date Months Held Annualized Gains S&P 500 Annualized Gain Alpha to the S&P 500 Combined Time-weighted Alpha to the S&P 500   2005 3/6/09 3/15/17 96 28.75% 31.13% -2.38% -4.83%   Even investing after a -70% decline, which would have almost bottom-ticked the Great Recession, Carnival still had such a weak recovery that it wasn\\'t able to produce alpha or shorten the holding period much. I think part of the explanation for this is that Carnival made a partial recovery in 2011, but failed to make a new high. \\n\\nCCL Total Return Price data by YCharts I think if Carnival could have turned around just a little bit faster in 2012, the stock price could have easily risen another twenty percent and outperformed the S&P 500, but a two-year delay in earnings growth created a five-year delay for the stock price. If the bulls are right, and Carnival is now in a secular bull market, it is entirely possible the stock could rebound faster during the next downturn. Conclusion Rotational investors who like Carnival\\'s long-term prospects can now rotate back into Carnival and gain ~33% more shares than they had in April at no extra cost. Investors on the sidelines waiting to get into Carnival (or looking to add to current positions) should consider taking a 1/2 position (1% portfolio weight) after a -50% decline from highs around $36.35 per share, and, should the price fall far enough, a second 1% weighted purchase around $21.82. As for me, if the price gets low enough, I\\'m much more interested in taking a chance on Carnival than I was in April, but I\\'m going to take a closer look at the business before buying. So, I\\'ve moved it from \"too hard\" to the \"on the fence\" pile. If the first buy price hits, I\\'ll write an update article with my final decision.\\n\\nDisclosure: I/we have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

Sales increased year-over-year. But the average sales per selling square foot metric still warrants concern.\\n        The retailer's new CEO, a well-respected industry influencer, hasn't had time to make his mark yet. Still, there are factors deserving of some level of discernment.\\n        Familiar words and familiar actions are like looming clouds - to be watched, to see if they do indeed become storm clouds.\\n        \"], 'article': [\"I wonder if the old adage about ducks applies to storm clouds? You know the adage I'm talking about – if it walks like a duck and talks like a duck, it's a duck. I haven't been able to ignore the clouds hovering over one of my favorite retailers. Though, in full disclosure, I have to admit this retailer didn't earn any of my Christmas spend this year. I'm watching the skies over Kirkland's (KIRK) closely. And, I'm getting more and more suspicious the looming clouds may actually be storm clouds. Kirkland's Kirkland's is a home décor retailer. In an October, 2018 investor presentation at the B. Riley FBR Consumer & Media Conference, the retailer described its merchandising model as providing “affordable, high quality, on trend home décor” and “premium seasonal decorating”. Other focuses include gifting and entertaining. In its 2017 annual report, the retailer noted it was attempting to “serve more home décor shoppers” (emphasis added).\\n\\nSource From fiscal 2009 to the third quarter of fiscal 2018, annual sales have grown year-over-year due to both organic growth and geographic expansion. The retailer now operates 432 stores in 37 states. \\n\\nSource: Author-created from company data\\n However, the average net sales per selling square foot metric has been under pressure. In fiscal 2016 and fiscal 2017, the average slipped below $250. By my estimations, it will come in below the $250 mark for fiscal 2018 as well. Helping to offset this pressure, Kirkland's online presence is growing. It more than tripled from $20 million in 2013 to nearly $66 million in 2017. To date in 2018, e-commerce sales total $53.2 million and comprise 12.35% of total sales. Another offset to the pressure is the adoption by Kirkland's consumers of its recently-introduced BOPUS (Buy Online, Pick Up in Store) service. This service improves margins for the company and sets up the consumer for add-on purchases during the pick-up transaction. But, the reality of slowing traffic and a decreasing average sales per selling square foot metric is still a looming cloud. As well, increasing expenses contributed to net income decreasing in fiscal 2017 to less than one-third of fiscal 2014. This is concerning because net income in fiscal 2014 was less than half of net income in fiscal 2010. With the pressure mounting, in April 2018, Kirkland's veteran CEO of 18 years, Mr. Michael Madden, announced his resignation. In September, the Nashville Post reported Mr. Madden's resignation was directly related to the retailer's need to “turn around performance”. Passing the Baton In late October, Steve “Woody” Woodward took the baton as Kirkland's new CEO. He is considered a giant in the home décor industry. In 2016, Better Homes and Garden named him an influential style maker. Mr. Woodward joined Kirkland's from his most recent position as Crate and Barrel's President and Chief Merchant. His career also spans executive positions with Pier I (PIR), Illuminations, The Bombay Company, and Fossil (FOSL). At Crate and Barrel, he was responsible for merchandising, product design and assortment selection. Mr. Woodward is a champion of omni-channel retailing which marries brick and mortar locations to online shopping.\\n “Our approach needs to be a blend — we have to reach out to our customers the way they want to be reached — and then be there when they are ready, whether buying at home or in one of our stores.” The industry would consider Kirkland's blessed to have Mr. Woodward at its helm. Still, it is a looming cloud as the majority of unexpected CEO transitions should be. Personally, I did not consider Mr. Woodward a natural fit at Kirkland's due to both his industry experience and his own personal lifestyle (described in more detail here). Signs So Far Kirkland's reported fiscal 2018 third quarter results on November 29th. Sales improved 6.6% year-over-year to $154.6 million including same-store sales growth of 1.4%. The retailer did report a net loss in the quarter, not necessarily a surprise for a third quarter. The retailer affirmed its full-year guidance for adjusted earnings in fiscal 2018 should exceed fiscal 2017. In fairness, Mr. Woodward had only been on board one week of the quarter and around six weeks when results were released. So, the third quarter results didn't actually point to clouds. Rather, the clouds popping up were relative to Mr. Woodward and appeared during the earnings call. Within seconds of his introduction, Mr. Woodward acknowledged the disconnect between his experience and Kirkland's strategy. “I want to be clear at the outset that my strategic focus will be to reinforce Kirkland's as a source for customers looking for home design ideas, while staying in the lane of affordable home décor.” The disconnect surfaced again during the Q&A portion of the call.  “Analyst: But, just to clarify, it sounds like you're not planning on pulling the rug out from under the existing customer, pun intended. Mr. Woodward: I'm not a rug-puller-out there. I love that comment. But, because I honestly respect the current customer - she has been loyal to Kirkland's, we want to make sure that she is engaged in part of our, what I would not call a turn-around, but a refresh of the Kirkland's brand. I love the DNA of this company. It's very value-driven and I want to stay with that proposition because there's a lot of white space, I believe, above the big box value players but below the specialty players.” \\n So, while his words certainly appear appropriate, there were also comments that rang an all-too-familiar bell. When Mr. Woodward joined Crate and Barrel in 2015, his goal was to “increase the quality of products” and “edit down the items in the store”. “We're supercharging the aesthetics and the theatrical appearance in our stores. We're selling much clearer stories.” In the earnings call, he shared some of his first impressions of Kirkland's. “I believe that we are not quite as clear as we need to be when the customer walks into the store. Our store should be the maximum expression of our brand. And, we had just a little too much going on to really be clear about what the statements that we're trying to make are. So, we want to use some slight editing and, I think, it gives more clarity to the customer when they walk in about what we're really trying to stand for going forward in the product.” If his approach is the same at Kirkland's as it was at Crate and Barrel, does that mean the quality of “affordable” ends up being abandoned? Whether Mr. Woodward will deliver on his commitment to Kirkland's existing customer and whether his editing will work at Kirkland's as it did at Crate and Barrel remains to be seen. There's simply not been enough time pass for actions to bear out the words. But, there were actions mentioned in the earnings call deserving of discernment. As detailed in my last Kirkland's article, Mr. Woodward will be compensated at a higher rate than Mr. Madden. However, his is not the only executive compensation increase. In the third quarter call, Kirkland's mentioned it had also hired a director for direct sourcing, a CIO and a vice president of store operations. Perhaps Kirkland's truly had gaps in these areas and some of its struggle comes from the need to fill the positions. Or, perhaps, it's just another instance where a new leader plumps the executive team as he commences his tenure. Francesca's Holdings (FRAN) comes to mind as a foreboding example. When Mike Barnes joined Francesca's in December, 2014, he almost immediately added “additional strength and experience” at greater costs. When Mr. Barnes took the helm at a struggling Francesca's, it was trading in the $11 to $12 range. When he left in mid 2016, it dropped to the $10 range. It now trades under $1.00. It could be argued the greater expenses directly contributed to Francesca's ongoing flailing and failings.\\n For me, Kirkland's director of direct sourcing position is specifically quizzical. Direct sourcing will be one of its alternatives to mitigate the possibility of tariffs increasing from 10% to 25% at the beginning of 2019. Direct sourcing will definitely provide a strategic path forward. During the gap between Mr. Madden's resignation and Mr. Woodward's start, President, Mr. Mike Cairnes, acted as CEO. In the earnings call, he provided this update on direct sourcing. “We've begun laying out the process of the product category plans. Woody and I are already talking to some agents. We've built a roadmap. Woody and I both have deep experience in direct sourcing. And the obvious implication is the opportunity on margin and cost reductions on the product. But what we're probably even more excited about is the opportunity to have a broader net of product opportunities and manufacturing options. And I think that's where you can sometimes get greater value. We expect that impact to start to really take root more second half of next year and the greater impact 2020 and 2021. So, my question is why not wait and let the savings from the activity fund the new position? As Mr. Cairnes shared, the company already has “deep experience” between himself and Mr. Woodward. Once their efforts are proven, a position dedicated to this activity could be justified. It just seems adding the expense before the positive impact is experienced could prove dangerous. Familiar words and familiar actions are like looming clouds - to be watched, to see if they do indeed become storm clouds. Execution As already mentioned, I didn't give Kirkland's any of my Christmas budget this year. It's not that I didn't visit the store. I just didn't contribute significantly to the company's top line. I bought one ornament. But, I did see the company's plan for its holiday season in action, at least to date.  “In the first part of the season, we have another great assortment of Christmas product for decorating the home. Clearly that product is resonating as we're coming off a very encouraging Black Friday weekend and our holiday product is selling through nicely. Then the customer shifts her mindset to gifting. What will be different this year is that we're following up with a terrific line-up of themed gift products available in-store and online. Then comes the third stage, post-Christmas. Last year, we relied on clearance to carry us through January. This year, you will see new relevant products, such as decorative storage, trend-right floral and inspiring modern farmhouse home décor product to fill the gaps when the Christmas decorations come down. This will help drive traffic while maintaining margins.” \\n So, in honesty, Kirkland's seasonal activity operated at a faster pace than my own. When I was ready to look for new Christmas decorations, my local Kirkland's inventory had been picked over and was low. It actually looked more like the week after Christmas. The store was apparently already in the “gifting” phase of its merchandising strategy. Granted, if this delivers a better performance for the company, the new schedule may deserve some of the credit. The difficult analysis will be deciding which factor to give credit – the best holiday spend by consumers in years or the change to Kirkland's merchandising flow. For Kirkland's shoppers like myself who were late to the game, we'll either adjust next year or go elsewhere like we did this year. Investment Considerations The day before Kirkland's reported third quarter results, a nervous market dropped the share price to a 52-week low of $6.78. Even in a nervous market, that price level seems a bargain. On November 29th, after the retailer reported, the share price jumped 34% higher and closed just above $10. As the calendar year closes out, it seems Kirkland's share price will settle in the $8 to $9 range. I do suspect the market will now give Mr. Woodward a couple of quarters to establish his influence. As a Kirkland's shopper, my curiosity is still piqued, even more so than it was when Mr. Woodward's appointment was announced. I am anxious to see where Woody's influence takes Kirkland's, fully realizing it could fall off my favorites list. But, as an investor, my interest is waning. Although, it is refreshing to see the fourth quarter's strategy executing as planned. As well, I'm pleased Mr. Woodward acknowledged the disconnect between his preferences and Kirkland's merchandise offerings. On the other hand, I'm concerned he will be employing, what now appears to be, his standard approach to a “refresh”. There still exists the possibility that simplifying and editing will not resonate with the Kirkland's loyal. I'm also concerned about the hasty additions at the executive level, especially in a capacity where his own experience runs deep.\\n However, if the market were to again drop the price below $7.20 before Kirkland's reports fourth quarter and full-year results in March, 2019, it would definitely be tempting to consider starting a small position.\\nDisclosure: I/we have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will follow at that time. [Operator Instructions]. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to introduce your host for today's call, Mr. Richard Ramlall, Chief Communication Officer. Mr. Ramlall, you may now begin. \\nRichard Ramlall\\nThank you. Good afternoon and thank you for joining us today. I'm joined by Pete Aquino, our Chief Executive Officer; and Jim Keeley, our Chief Financial Officer. Pete will be making brief prepared remarks, then we will move quickly to take in your questions. We encourage you to ask questions particularly modeling questions as we would like this forum to be efficient both for you the audience and for management and to be helpful to all of our analysts and investors including those participating on the call today and those who listen to the replay.\\nThe press release we issued this afternoon is available on our website on both the Newsroom section on our main page and the Press Release section on our Investor Relations page.\\nDuring this call, we will present both GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are included in today's earnings press release.\\nManagement believes that our presentation of non-GAAP financial measures provides useful supplemental information to investors regarding our results of operations. And our non-GAAP financial measures should only be considered in addition to, and not as a substitute for, or superior to any measure of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP.\\nToday's call contains forward-looking statements, as described in our press release, which we urge you to read. These statements are not guarantees of future performance. Because these statements are based on certain assumptions and involve risks and uncertainties, there are important factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements. We discuss these factors in our filings with the SEC, which are available on the SEC or on our IR website. We undertake no obligation to amend, update or clarify these statements made as of today, December 18, 2018.\\nNow, let me turn the call over to Peter Aquino. Pete?\\nPeter Aquino\\nThank you, Richard. Thank you, everyone. I hope you all received the press release, I apologize for such a short notice but we thought it was important to get out an end-of-year letter, given the volatility of the market and the concerns and we wanted to make an additional communication, during this downtime before we report the fourth quarter. Many of you on this call have been talking to us over the last several months -- certainly last several weeks given the equity raise and some of the other things we’ve been doing, I appreciate all of your comments, and we’ve taken a lot of meetings, we’ve done a few conferences in between, and our goal at the end of the day is to communicate as best as possible and to be -- to fully disclose what we’re doing. \\nFrom a guidance standpoint in 2018, the original guidance we put out at the beginning of the year and what we have today for the most part is on track. We’ll be going through some of those talk points today to help you to think through the fourth quarter, first quarter, and 2019, so that at the end of the day all of our models are aligned and are on track. There’s a lot of confusion certainly with INAP, primarily driven by the closures of our data centers, which has been on the table for almost two years, since we’ve been here. \\n\\nSo, with that today, I’d like to go through a couple of quick points, again the press release is quite detailed and I will take the questions to make sure we got it all. \\nSo for 2019 the outlook really is a strong projection also what I would call new base line active datacenters are closed and together we closed about six datacenters that were either underperforming or losing revenue. At the end of the day, taking those out will save a lot of rent, will probably improve this flagship that's nearby in terms of its capabilities and penetration. This is a good business decision. We call this basically the year of an enhanced portfolio of a new baseline that we can grow EBITDA even further, I think, to some of the estimates I've seen because we expect to exit the fourth quarter very close to 40%, and we have a path to get there. So over the last two years the management is really trying to get this portfolio shaped up. We've had a lot of assets spread across the world and we believe 4% to 6% organic growth off of a solid baseline is doable for us. \\nNow keep in mind we've discussed this many times that I had this little bit different than a hybridscale datacenter company, our peer group is pretty light in terms of -- that comps. ph[Everyone] that you read about that's public is probably [a REIT] and doing hyperscale investments. The average capital investments that I've been looking at year-over-year for hyperscalers has been 72% of revenue, many of them well over 100%. So from a lead perspective our 13% capital intensity is very close to what I see in the public or the -- I'm sorry, the private tier group. So the tier point is 6 terra and reflect central -- they look more like us we're more retail in nature, we're all trying to score bigger wholesale deals and we’ll put capital to work to get us a wholesale deals. The other advantage we have at INAP as you know is we have some excess space, and we've been working our way through, doing pretty good at it and certainly [sucking] up the power in high density sales but again at end of the day, we have really good datacenters and trade markets. So we’re going to leverage that and we're going to leverage the ability to take that extra square foot that's available and benefit best if I am having a lower capital program all in.\\nNow the recent equity raise, which we talked a lot about one-on-one in conferences and so on, provided a couple of great things for us. One, it also involves a market such as we have it gives us a cushion against any covenants that were even closer to being an issue. So that covenant freedom is good, it buys us time for a debt re-financing without a gun to our head and we expect and hope that capital markets will turn [updation] in early next year and we will enter the market, do it with every financing.\\nThe credit facility we have today is quite tight in lot of areas, the same credit facility we've bought two years ago and it's not very flexible at all. We've been positioning to get Peter to do this refi. The equity could help turn [indiscernible] but it’s also going to help in growth, so the flexibility we're looking to get through the new deal is not urgent but certainly on top of our list and something we want to do and we think it will be great for the company. So as soon as Credit Suisse gives us green light, we’ll get into the market. \\nThe EBITDA range for 2018 is on track as our revenues, revenues are a little bit more pressured because of closures and we accelerated everything to get out of those deals by the end of the year, so a little bit more pressure on revenues within the range EBITDA's running a little higher. So the good news is our cost cuts and the profitability push we have is what we really want. EBITDA and conservative capital programs going into '19 will produce free cash flow. And that’s the position we are in I would say almost finally so that we could grow this company profitably and produce cash. \\n\\nSo getting out of those non-core and underperforming data center assets were the medicine we said we are going to take, and good news is they are done.\\nThe repositioning of the company into '19 literally starting end of the first quarter would be realization that the $10 million of revenue associated with disclosures has to feather in now. So we'll take some of that revenue decline, some of it came through the year anyway and it’s transferred to the [G&A]. But for the most part fourth quarter and then a full brunt of it in the first quarter will be realized of that $10 million. So the impact is going to make its way through the first quarter. And again if you look at the outlook for the year it’s not a huge step-down but relative to the analysts’ forecast and I saw before it looks like none of them really contemplated the $10 million difference. So our outlook incorporates that. We are taking that medicine right away like I said and it will be effective basically end of fourth quarter and into first quarter as we grow the new baseline.\\nSo the other huge benefit is cash. The cash rent savings is literally going to drop to $2.5 million a quarter that we have been carrying throughout '18 to basically zero, as that $10 million cash savings on just rent from those facilities that were dragging us down. So that cleanup was necessary and, again, in terms of new stuff. \\nSo our outlook for the full year of 2019 on a base case capital program of $40 million, put a $10 million aside in case we find a wholesale deal that we can land. So we are advocating a $40 million to $50 million capital program again earmarked for not only retail and success base, but some really important projects that we have now in Toronto, Montreal, Phoenix, Santa Clara and UK through our partnerships with COLT. These target markets are INAP markets for us to do well and we want to have capital for that.\\nThe margin expansion as I mentioned before and EBITDA is what pays the bill, what keeps the cash flow going. And we think we are going to be exiting very close to 40% this year. I would say it’s almost going to be on the straight-line from where we are in the fourth quarter to end the year and we have a path to get there like I said. One thing I mentioned on many calls before, it’s pretty obvious that the international portfolio today is not contributing as high in terms of profitability as the US portfolio, it’s pretty typical when we look at data center platforms but in our case it’s primarily due to less colo inventory in international. We believe the COLT facility is going to help in that regard. We think the market in the Montreal is going to help and Toronto as well.\\nOur outlook for the full year for the new baseline of revenue is $325 million to $335 million, again if you take the $10 million out that’s really the difference in some of the forecast, but some of the analysts have asked really the run rate, the baseline, again the good news is EBITDA is probably going to accelerate, so our average for the year we’re contemplating about 37% on a calendar basis, that’s a 120%, 130%. Again inside of this machine, 4% to 6% organic growth on a 13 plus or minus percent capital intensity program, is the suite that we’re in, and we think that’s a very good baseline to run from.\\nSome last minute points, some of the Board initiatives, we just finished the Board meeting last week, we asked for a couple of things, we said; one, given the stock price today and reading about how others are looking at this opportunity from the standpoint of -- that this opportunity that undervalued we should have a stock repurchase program on the shelf ready to go. Regarding our debt facility, today it’s quite safe, we don’t have a lot of capacity before that but whatever we have, we asked the Board for an authorization of the $5 million to repurchase our shares, opportunistically as we go through the year. So, the new credit facility in the next few quarters or so will look to expand that capacity in the future, again if the volatility persists, at least we’ll have that opportunity to explore.\\n\\nThe other thing we’re going to do is we’re talking to certain banks today, and we’re going to actively pursue the sale of certain non-core assets and these could be data centers on the lower end, be data centers not core to our personal strategic plan but maybe to somebody else’s, we know we’ve very good ones to offer, so we’re talking to a bank right now to basically matchmake a direct sale. Now dealing with the volatility may be an issue, I am not sure but we’re going to be more active in this regard because at some point, it’s going to be win-win between the two CEOs.\\nThe other thing that we’ve done through the board in our discussions is we decided to realign management in our structure today probably for $300 [billion] plus, but one would argue maybe little bit top heavy regarding having two general managers running two segments that we consolidated under Andy Day and we promoted him to Chief Operating Officer, he will be in that sense one general manager, running three product lines, colo, cloud and network and that will be the umbrella and we’ll still have the two segments U.S. and international. Streamlining I think will help, good team work will also help with execution, and communication even within our plan. \\nCorey Needles who was the General Manager for US is leaving at the end of year. We also hired a recent Head of Sales, Rich O'Dea, out of Equinix. He was a successful leader in the Northeast, selling to fintech, he came into the company few months ago and was doing great as a leader. It gave us more confidence to align under Andy and Rich O'Dea will be our Global Head of Sales, putting everybody again, under its umbrella. Last but not least, we’ll continue corporate development, it’s really a smart thing to do along with organic growth in many cases, we have some holds in certain markets, including Northern Virginia, Chicago, Toronto and some parts of Europe. \\nWe have opportunities, we're looking at deals all the time we just want to make sure we do a smart deal when necessary to fill gap and really have and we've been really careful overlooking at a lot of deal flow to the extent because the accretive and [time grade are those are the markets producing]. Our customers need to have our inventory. \\nSo as we continue improving this portfolio as probably something that we will always do, we look for opportunities, we have been working with banks and advisors that help us get through 2019 as smart as possible and I think at the end of the day we are well positioned to take on not only weather this storm but to take advantage of still very hot and growing market in infrastructure services. The final note for at least from an accounting perspective this will probably be the first year out of three that we are not changing the [sites,] so no worries there. \\nSo operator at this point we like to take questions. \\nQuestion-and-Answer Session\\nOperator\\n[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Dan Kurnos with Benchmark.\\nDan Kurnos \\nGreat, thanks. Good afternoon and Peter appreciate you doing this and getting sort of all the information out publicly and I know there has been a lot of stuff floating out there. So let me just kick it off by kind of asking you and addressing some of those rumors obviously the stock fell almost back to where you started when it was a growing concern I think there are concerns that you can't do the refinance or you'd have to raise more. I know you addressed that in your prepared remarks, but with the stock kind of trading where it is maybe if you just want to talk about your ability to continue to win new deals or if there is any impact on your ability to get the refinance done given the equity price action lately?\\nPeter Aquino\\nThanks, Dan. This is probably in category of a soft [fall] in a sense that to the extent there are rumors or growing concern that's a little disturbing to me because we’re nowhere near that issue and frankly even not only the operations performance of the company in the current credit facility that we have but the equity raise really took that card away too because the extra $40 million to help with some of the ratios just gives us the runway we need. \\n\\nNow that being said, we still treat it as an urgent matter, the fact that we communicated that we want to do a debt refinancing opportunistically should not have signaled that we have to do it at any cost right now because we have a gun to our head. So, thank you for putting that out there because that is just wrong. \\nAnd I think also unfortunately some posters have been calculating some of those ratios has been -- and I've heard everything from using the wrong amendments, the wrong numbers to -- and since it's very confusing so I understand that and the communication today was meant to help maybe simplify but from the standpoint of imminent danger and I don’t take that lightly because capital markets are very hard to predict and I don’t do that for a living. I think many people on this call tried. But my goal is to keep the company safe and although that equity raise felt horrible I did fear that the future ability to raise money was only getting worse and execution aside which all of us have comments there. We think we had to get that in while we can so that we can protect the company from this type of concern. \\nSo therefore having people still rumor it is a little confusing to me because I would think that would have been taken off the table. But that being said we still treat it as an urgent matter just as practicality and being conservative. We will use Credit Suisse to help us with this, they’re professionals, they are guiding us wisely. And then we will be added as soon as the market opens and certainly December was not the time to do it, even though we frankly were ready to do it then.\\nRegarding the stock price and the concern that customers will look at single-digit stock prices I would say one thing. I understood it at the industry, too, and I watched 25 to 30 stocks every day and I know lot of CEOs are like me looking at single digits stock prices right now that probably have the same concern I have but we are not singled out, out there. Now that being said everybody is concerned that single digit stock prices cause fear, doubt, and uncertainty so we don’t like being here and certainly don’t want to be here very long. So hopefully the markets that are from a broader perspective come back in favor and a lot of us frankly can't wait but in the meantime we got to run our business every day and in some way do best we can to alleviate concerns even by our customers to the extent they have them. So putting out of this public release certainly sooner rather than later so people are guessing and wondering and doubting was our intention to communicate better. And many of you on this call and I have had these discussions probably over the last like I said months or so and I’ve gotten a lot of good advice in coaching and feedback on what would you do if you are me and communicating better and more often and putting the numbers out there was certainly the coaching I got. And hopefully this helps in the narrative.\\nDan Kurnos \\nSo then just on kind of the business trends since you have given the guidance, in terms of the organic growth for next year. I think maybe the DC exits, granted yes, we didn't have it in the numbers, but the size of it maybe a little bit larger than anticipated but it sounds like you are making up for some of that. Just can you talk about underlying churn ex the voluntary DC exits and just sort of maybe I know you don’t want to go probably too much into Q4 but how backlog is trending in your visibility and to new business wins that gives you confidence in the forward forecast?\\nPeter Aquino\\nYes, I think look the forecast we put on the tables one that we have been modeling. This business is very bulky in nature in a sense that there is a lot of lead times on bigger deals. The last lead deal we scored was the big deal seven figure contract value that takes time to install. We did three big ones last year in '18. I hope if we can double that and that’s why Jim and I put 10 million to the side and said, “let's swing a little bit more for defenses, the RPs that we are dealing with now are more wholesale in nature.” We are trying to get bigger deals in. But the suit that we are in relative to the private guys and you guys know this because they have [public] debt, is that, the 46% organic growth is the right size for 15% capital intensity, that’s the match, now if you want to do more, if you want the interaction and go 14% a quarter, and you’re talking about 75% to 100% capital program which means you’ve to have a big wholesale deal in your hand and put that capital to work and then you get that growth. And frankly while we grow up which I don’t know if it’s year three or or four, is I want to be both, I want to be retail which gives us a lot of diversity in customer base, for sure and it gives us an opportunity for those customers lot of them are grown to give us runway and some of them are bigger than a bread basket in a sense that they’ve a hybrid environment while they might have some soft layer, they might have some Amazon, they may have colo with digital, they’re big enough, they might be all over the place to the extent we can earn more consolidation and that riddle I think would solve the connectivity and that’s unique to us. We’re talking to customers now that are in five data centers of ours, and want to connect it on the SD-WAN, that’s something that is going to be unique to us and frankly an advantage, a competitive advantage because a lot of data center companies don’t do that. So my sense is we got to keep adding methodically, if we want to grow faster than 46% it’s literally a different model, and will be more wholesale in nature; I am not going to talk about hybrid scale per se, but good model to look at I think is an interaction to that at 20 years, is the hybrid of both retail, which that addressable market is lot bigger than the hybrid scale market. I feel sorry, to a certain extent for the hyperscale guys especially in Ashburn here where we’re because when Amazon won -- has one deal to offer, there’s six guys fighting for that tooth and nail, it’s not really our model, our model is more like Cyxtera, and flex and probably to your point where we have an addressable market that is an enterprise market. I mean in some ways you get everybody else but hyperscale, but we could get our customers to them, through connectivity and we could entertain a hybrid cloud environment between public and private.\\n\\nI just really like the cards we have and the portfolio groomed and positioned, I think it is going to be fine. Now, how do we grow faster? May we get lucky to a certain extent then I would say this luck is got to be still at market to score bigger deals, and if we can score not 1 megawatt deals but twos and threes and frankly Phoenix can handle it, Atlanta can handle it, Secaucus can handle it, and we get some big customer demand in there, and it could change the profile. What we put on the table today from an outlook perspective is more business as usual and progressively improving. But we’re working and to do more and hopefully we can get in the position to do more.\\nDan Kurnos \\nAnd then just last one from me, because I’ve taken a decent amount of time here, just on the modeling, just two kind of two quick questions, it sounds like just mapping it out, it’s sort of a 2 million ish sequential step down, I don’t know if that the timing of it is more heavily weighted into Q1, bigger step down than Q4 of this year depending on where the exits were, but that seems to be kind of the right map to get you to sort of right around the mid-point-ish for next year is that fair mostly coming out of colo and does your guide next year include any benefit at all from revenue from the new fiber rings?\\nPeter Aquino\\nIt has some fiber rings revenue next year and working backwards the ranges that we have for '18 includes basically the fourth quarters inside of that, what we signaled today is that we accelerate to get these done. So some of the revenue came off a little bit faster in the fourth quarter although still in the range maybe at the lower end of the range. Now the new bad words that I learned in the last month or two is called midpoint, okay, I don’t love midpoint. We're offering a range I know many of us on the call are talking about this appoint, but it’s a range between I don’t really know until we’re there if we’re at the middle end up or down because some of these deals frankly especially on the closures I have three squatters right now that I can't get out of the datacenter, so there's timing issues associated with that were really helping the reader say when I give a range I really mean the midpoint, I am telling you now that may not be the case. When I say range it’s probably a range and there is some flex in there that to the extent we can help get you closer and we probably will but it's very hard for us at the end of the day to basically have you assume that a range meet midpoint, I only say that can because in the fourth quarter for example we are signaling couple of things we're accelerating the closure. And we are saying it could be within the range, it should be within the range we've put out our guidance that -- but all that said it is at the lower end of revenue range borrowing something I don’t know right now sitting here in December '18 which could be non-recurring, it could be somebody does squat and doesn’t leave because our revenue will stay, if he doesn’t leave your revenue is there. So I would signal for you for now fourth quarter revenue the lower end of the total end-of-year range at six. From a EBITDA perspective probably doing better I said that too. I think EBITDA is better. EBITDA frankly we can control more because it involves cost cutting and guess what, we are pretty good at that. But we don’t want to cut cost to the bone, we want to cut cost that are associated with these non-core assets and those we have found in spades like I said as we name six but we’re probably up to 10 in nature but they are not as big, they’re just loose change, they’re a pop here and there. You saw us negotiate another portfolio of datacenter asset in international. This stuff we still could do, that's why I think 40% literally coming at a 35% plus or minus in the third quarter is almost the straight line to 40% in the fourth quarter next year. Every quarter is sitting here now I'd see opportunity either through profitable revenue growth for additional product cost, basically real-estate clean-up that we’re still doing. It's not as big as before. I think we said 10 million was basically the number of these six that these six datacenters that 10 in the category of something we've been working on literally for two years, but that’s done now. Going forward, we are optimizing the portfolio as we see it. So for guidance purposes or modeling purposes maybe better said is that we're at 35% we're going to 40% you can almost take a straight line and get us back. You can be conservative in the fourth quarter, knowing that the full brunt of the 10 is going to hit the first quarter and we are going up from there. And that’s kind of the outlook for revenue you can probably can model pretty well. The reason why also the revenue range is still 10 million wide but wide enough is I'm not really sure what's going to happen with wholesale scores this year. if we just do the three like we did last year it would probably be at the lower end of the outlook. If we do six or seven, it could be great. So that being said all else equal that’s the opportunity at hand. If you look at our pipeline or backlog 20 million every quarter is kind of where we are. If we can put more on that bag that would help us too.\\n\\nSo we are pushing on every angle like I said I think the sales team is constantly improving leadership from Rich is really helpful right now because we are doing a lot of things well. He can help us do thing great. So now we just got to get lucky and score some of these deals.\\nOperator\\nOur next question comes from George Sutton with Craig Hallum.\\nGeorge Sutton\\nPete, I wanted if you could given that we talked from an earnings call perspective 45 days ago what sort of caused the desire to close things more quickly? Just curious what changed in your view in the last 45 days that really accelerated this move? I understand the stock I understand the potential refinance scenario, but I'm just curious if there's something fundamental that changed that caused this.\\nPeter Aquino\\nThat’s a great question, George. Literally you were here with us the reason why it was in the category of acceleration is because we notified and worked with customers for you can imagine six to nine months maybe more explaining that this is happening. What you have and if you ever experienced that I'm not sure maybe with other company, exiting colo is not one of the top things that the customer wants to do, okay. It is like the worst thing you could ask the customer to do is to take their colo environment and move next door, move upstairs it’s not fun. They got spaghetti wires going through those servers, and they don’t want to touch them. So the acceleration came in such a way what I said as well. If they’ll move we are going to turn the power off and then their business is going to shutdown. It was a little bit of tough love because maybe they can stay. And we said it’s not an option because the savings of 2.5 million of these rents a quarter that we have been paying that we still have to drag along is something you have got a straggler because sometimes if you have 25% of a hall occupied you just can't get out. That last 25% is a killer. But you have to give it back to the landlord in some condition. This -- everything is timing. So we felt to a certain extent that we had to get the last few to move and we had to do something little bit more dramatic potentially than I was planning for. And also to start off frankly with ‘19 as clean as possible knowing there was no reason why this could be done by now other than a little bit more elbow grease. But in my customer’s defense I understand this is not great, that’s why we wanted to do it and rip the band aid off and get it done because this is not something that data center companies should do, if they don’t have to. These partner sites that we’re in, were not good; and the ones we’ve selected were hostile, at best. So the medicine that we have to take, the faster the better, acceleration caused a little bit more revenue drop faster than maybe we planned, but still again within the guidance we put. And if you talk to my team knowing that revenue is precious, declining revenue in a bad partner site is a melting ice cube that doesn’t help headwinds regarding what we’re trying to do with this company which is to grow it, and trying to outrun, negative trends in a particular site, and knowing that you can save so much money if you were in there so EBITDA is much better off, I don’t want to do that too long, so we put pedal to metal and it cost us little bit more in revenue, but we’ll have a cleaner ‘19.\\nGeorge Sutton\\nA common question I get relates to your current capital position alongside your desire for corporate development activity in key metro areas where you don’t have capacity yourself, so northern Virginia’s, Chicago’s as examples, can you talk about that push and pull from a capital versus a corporate development goal?\\nPeter Aquino\\nIt’s probably much like every CEO’s issue where you can grow organically certainly, ‘a time to rest’. If I could repurpose some of the cash, from the sale of market A, and you issue a triple net lease in a good market or buy property in another market, there’s still lot of single tenant really great buildings to get, rather than buying a portfolio from a sale process, at some very high evaluation. Frankly, none of those deals will happen now as you know. The key to our portfolio moving -- our customers have been asking for more inventory in Chicago, Northern Virginia, London I think we saw in Toronto, and we’re also maxed out in Montreal which has low power cost, and we’ve to do something about that, which we can control that one. If we could find a way in those markets, it could be a partnership deal like COLT, that gave us a lot of inventory in London, or could be a partnership deal maybe with the REIT in a sense that we get a good deal on the fall or something and maybe get 3 megawatts to offer. We’re looking at everything, but the main thing is customers driving us there demand, in certain markets are hotter than others, no pun intended, Santa Clara is hot, Phoenix is hot, Dallas is hot, and we’ve really good footprints there and to the extent we could free it up. Again, in the case of Santa Clara we’ve some floor space that we could put customers rent it out, so we said it, what we’re going to do is we’re going to augment the power, we’re going to make an investment through the capital program and power upgrades so we can free up that space. I think potentially misinterpreted by somewhat that really meant but it means fits very simply spend $2 million to $3 million and put more power, equipment and supply into Santa Clara and that other 47% becomes available, full stock. Why would he do that? The reason why we couldn't do it sooner is because the municipality didn't -- you had to get on a waiting list for two years, the waiting list finally popped we get in and that's how we’ll solve the problem and in Santa Clara it's very hot in terms of that you have the capacity there, you can attract great customer. So we want to go crazy with deals that require I think some folks on the call and I think I heard it last time I don’t want you to do a deal, you know I don’t want you to raise equity to do a deal. Look, at the end of the day we get it I'm a big shareholder too, I get it like you do. How do we get it, however, with the push and pull of a portfolio to the extent we can be smart about it and do within our what we can afford in our own suite, maybe we could sell an asset, buy down some debt and pin down the asset that we are looking for on the other side and why we are looking at all of these ideas and we're now trying to just make it hard we are trying to find opportunities and be smart about it. And to the extent we have runway and timing, we can be smart about it. We have a lot of people out there working for us in one way or another whether they’re commercial real-estate guys are in our camp we're participating in our RFPs and in some cases it's participating in RFPs without having inventory to market but we winning the deals is like everybody else I'll find the inventory in the market because that's probably pretty fast deal. So we are trying to do things smart George and we are trying to move this company to a point where we’re positioned to be a player in the metro market that we are in and our competition in these markets are more retail like in nature, so we probably see Equinix frankly in where were the opponent in those deals, our price and flexibility, on connectivity and kind of one-stop shop in lot of ways especially in the public cloud or the private cloud rather service. So we want play in and if we are smart about it so we can maybe have our cake and eat it too. Capital markets are part of that story so that is difficult in the next three months or so and it was literally we have no flexibility in our current credit facility sitting here today to do anything. I don’t think I can do anything else. Even our stock repurchase plans of $5 million that's what I got and so we've got a couple of things that are very important to do, they take a little bit of improvement in the market for sure, we have really great advisors to tell us when to pull the trigger and we have an idea of what it takes to keep INAP safe and growing for the long-term. We are in the game and I think we’re in the right place. \\n\\nGeorge Sutton\\nOne other question and you had mentioned kind of a match making scenario relative to some of your non-core assets. I assume you are referring to historically define non-core assets like Ubersmiths and Funio, I'm not sure if it extends to iWeb, I'm just curious how you're defining non-core assets?\\nPeter Aquino\\nNon-core assets could include those businesses, for sure. I don’t want to be too bold and say everything is for sale but there are some data centers that frankly if I traded at one market because it was good for another CEO even if it’s a healthy and growing market and I redeploy that capital and make it up Santa Clara for the second floor because I can build the second floor in that building. I want to grow in Santa Clara let’s say I blow out the 47% when I put the power in where do I go after that. Well I can go to second floor. If we can sale an asset another data center maybe in a market that’s somebody matches up with better maybe I can trade. So as you know, I know all the CEOs in my space that are our size for sure and I know the CEOs that are running public company that has our data center sizes in size. So it’s a small neighborhood really. In the industry, the biggest player is only $3 billion digital is $2 billion and everybody is under $1 billion after that. So that’s a very small neighborhood regarding who I can talk to and to the extent I can get some help to match make if the CEO doesn’t call me him or herself then. Two years ago, I couldn’t have that conversation because we were distressed. Today, we are a healthy company, stock price aside I can have that conversation because the company is healthier the assets that well be getting are healthier and if we can trade good for good versus win lose then that’s the way to keep this portfolio moving and we are having those discussions.\\nOperator\\nOur next question comes from Frank Louthan with Raymond James.\\nFrank Louthan\\nJust a couple of details for the model. Can you give us some updates on what your colo square feet available will be in utilization and that sort of thing after we make this cut and sort of magnitude to the base we are looking at?\\nPeter Aquino\\nIf you take the third quarter chart, the -- some of the pro forma for BofA and Coke is probably in there. Santa Clara is pretty much updated. That’s not a bad starting point Frank. There is not too much going on after that. In the case of some of the triple net lease footprint we know in advance where we did deals that for example Coke who have a whole building is going to exit some of the footprint and free it up for us to selling that’s why we got out of the downtown partner site you know the name of the company. So that is kind of an in and out maybe the timing issue. We would have liked that but because we are in there already and Coke squatted for a whole year. they have the whole building. BofA little similar Bank of America is an anchor. They have a little bit of footprint that’s going away is part of our outlook. It’s been included day one we’ve known it forever. And we will probably put SingleHop footprint that’s in the IO in Bank of America. And it connects the capital move. So if you move them in and move and that cloud pod into BofA then we can edit the I/O which is going to be another EBITDA cost savings. So Jim’s put a capital program in place to do that, which shouldn’t be that much money.\\nSo on the edge of that Frank, this portfolio is pretty much it, Montreal which is capped out at 95% we’ve a capital program in place to build out another floor in existing data center, that’s in the outlook for 2019, Montreal is great market, as you know, power costs are low, like I said, so we’ll fix Montreal, Dallas is going to probably be occupied a little bit higher than we see here in the third quarter 57% because Blade took down. [indiscernible] one shot, so that 57% is going to go up in case of Dallas. Seattle, these are guys are calling me to find more capacity in Seattle, I think we sold out downtown, so we’ve a couple footprints there, and on average it’s just 61% but in couple of footprints that they -- customers wanted, on both, we’ll have to look it down a little bit for augment perspective. Boston is going to be corrected if you will because there’s 48% occupancy, that includes some of the building next door which I am getting out of, I think Boston is going to be very productive, one of the customers that moved from [indiscernible] growing, growing pretty largely. So I won’t be surprised if Boston performance improves dramatically in ’19. Houston is a little flat right now. Chicago doesn’t have a lot of capacity, the only capacity we see in Chicago, there really is SingleHop sitting in Digital Realty, so we’re talking to [indiscernible] to see if we can get more space in Chicago with them. The other markets literally are targets, we can do more in the Amsterdam, we can do some consolidation in Amsterdam, SingleHops and another building we’ve consolidated there. We could do more in London, I am really excited about the COLT relationship, they may want to do more with us. We get a lot of pressure to put a pod, cloud pod in Singapore, I’d like to sign a contract and then make the investment, so us and the customer are talking about that, very actively. Northern Virginia is a little weird because it’s a hyperscale market if you’ve been in the market, 70% of all Internap traffic goes through the air, and the campuses are large, and they’re mostly hyperscale but certain customers want retail space there, literally because it’s in almost everybody is here. So, I can probably do that with a contract first, and a triple net lease in the next segment, somebody else has some [right here]. So that’s a fast go through, again third quarter chart in the press release Frank, it is pretty helpful and we can talk offline if I missed any other factors.\\n\\nFrank Louthan \\nAnd then when you look at the refinancing, are you looking beyond, the current lending group, you have, or you’re looking to stay with the same folks?\\nPeter Aquino\\nWell, that’s a loaded question, in my discussions with our advisors I like a lot of our lending group we’ve Angelo Gordon, we’ve Carlyle Group, we’ve Edinbaum. That's one. We’ve a pretty good group and they’re very supportive, certainly we’ll be talking to them. I think while I was here we did one, two, three, four amendments to credit facility save for the first one which was very contentious because that's a prior life. Once we got past that and got this lender group that's in place have been very supportive. So I don’t really have any complaints but we haven’t crossed that bridge quite yet. \\nOperator\\nOur next question comes from Jon Peterson with Jefferies. \\nJon Peterson \\nSo I'm curious on the guidance I know you've gone through the revenue side of things on the EBITDA side, you guys are certainly calling for some pretty significant margin expansion. Wondering if you can kind of breakdown where the cost savings are coming from, and how much of that is coming from the four datacenter exits and just the not having to pay rent there anymore and how much of that is coming from other places where you are able to rationalize cost?\\nPeter Aquino\\nYes, Jonathan I mean if you think about 35% to 36% current stake the only way you move that is really three levers for pulling, maybe four. The first one is we still have some cost -- in this that is that our part of the timing issue it could be a lease that signing out, could be renegotiation of a portfolio of assets under one vendor, it could be a major contract renegotiation that we are dealing with so, in the category, there’s still some wood to chop that's related to timing and opportunity and we still have that. The second is, as long as we sell more profitable deals and that's certainly has been one of our goals will get EBITDA out of that and to the extent it's colo the EBITDA margins at colo is 68% plus. Because it's typically will either be your center which is very high or maybe a site like Digital Reality where the margins are less but, not by much. So selling colo in the U.S. is very profitable. Selling their metal servers more so on an advanced platform of SingleHop, we’ve just begun this item with that because SingleHop was growing on it's own, a fairly small company, now they're selling across our whole base. And the investments in pods in London, Toronto, that Jennifer Curry has put up right now and maybe Singapore could be a new growth engine, that’s very profitable as well because basically with a pod you invest in 1 or 2 million to set it up and then kind of the gift that keeps on giving in terms of profitability. So we have been asked by customers to go to those markets as capital program is driven and that's a very targeted EBITDA growth. There’s two more, last but not least, there's still some realignment we can do inside the company that's more of an organization improvement that's on the edge of incremental benefit. There is always some room there for improvement and then finally, if you look at the contribution margins for international, they are about 33% versus 45% USA. The reason why international's lag like I said before it's pretty common across a global portfolio that has both international trends to be dragged along because the U.S. customer needed that too, less deficits actually on the international footprint. But we don’t have a lot of colo inventory international. We have mostly international plays mostly made up of iWeb and some SingleHop platform in Amsterdam. So it’s not as big portfolio of business so to speak. We need more colo. If we can get colo in Toronto now we are building Montreal in this COLT deal in London that’s colo inventory that’s very accretive. If we can get the international margins from 30s to 40 that probably does it all by itself. And don’t forget we still have INAP Japan. INAP Japan incrementally is doing much better with single-digit EBITDA. Now they are double digits and growing it’s a management issue really and there are opportunities to grow, it’s pretty significant. They are in Toronto and Osaka. There have been a little bit captive in inventory. It was an NTT-INAP partnership that really was not really taken care of, I would say, prior to us. And we have a great team there. We can give them more and be successful. Those are the four levers on the elevator pitch I can tell you John that we would pull to get to 40 and we should. These are the things we should be doing anyway. The private peer group does fell low 40s to mid 40 and I know their profile and they are in tier 2 markets and maybe the network helps too. So we had the right tools, the question is can I get it done over the next four quarters. I would say we are committed. So, that’s how we’re going to get there. Frankly it’s a model that you may not have many of them model that because a lot of those things are kind of inside basically.\\n\\nJon Peterson \\nAnd then I know you touched on this a lot but I guess in terms of clean up the portfolio. I'm just trying to think about how we should be thinking about these four data center exits and kind of how do we re-categorize them in terms of the overall long-term business plan of Internap? Could you talk about how you might -- there might be some opportunities to sell assets in the future to be opportunistic maybe to raise some capital to get yourself into some better markets? But it sounds like you [indiscernible] as soon as you exit or more just kind of non-core stuff that we are I guess part of the long-term plan to get out of those facilities because they were never going to be all that profitable. So maybe if you can help me break down how many data centers are left in your portfolio that are more like the four that you just exited where it kind of over the long-term years waiting for those leases to expire or whatnot because it makes sense to get out of them. And then like how much -- I don't know if you can put a percentage on the portfolio that you think would make the -- I guess more valuable to somebody else or there might be an opportunity to raise some capital?\\nPeter Aquino\\nYes, I know you are new to the story to a certain extent but this has been the pretty consistent narrative. We exited six and we identified at least five when I got here three years ago. These were data centers that you were here with us who would say show me a list of data centers and their profitability and you were bottoms up in the first five six were circled. Now because they have contracts and term we have to be smart about when they do it. A lot of these contracts are still in place and will be in place into mid ‘19 which means we still pay the cash for that, so it drag is down on a basis that declining but we’ve to take medicine to do that, so we had probably 50 plus data centers in our portfolio, when we started, we distinguished the data centers, making two categories, one our flagships which are our data center, we don’t own the land, we don’t own the shelf, we rent the shelf, we put all the critical infrastructure in and we have about 14 of those today that we love, they’re highly profitable and they’re flagship high net data centers. The balance of the data center portfolio is sort of a declining tail because some of them are bigger than a bread basket like we’ve Phoenix with Digital Realty, we’ve very big customers in say a 10,000 square foot footprint, maybe a hall or so. We’ve probably 10 that look like that. And then it declines more because you’re in a -- you’ve a colo footprint but it’s in a very small location. So, from the standpoint, are there any more like the six? Not really that are just horrible in our eye, but of the 14 if I wanted to sell one or two of them, that aren’t in the strategic plan of INAP going forward, or I convince myself, I’d rather sell them, get down to 12 and take that money, pay down debt, and maybe pin down in Chicago, that’s what I am talking about doing. And those are opportunistic, I can -- if I -- I know which ones I want, I know which ones I’d love to sell, and I know the price I want, it’s just the function of getting that done in a timely manner with two people in the room, except me talking to myself, but INAP has been going through a transformation in two years. The portfolio has been improving I would say everyday that I have been here and the EBITDA and revenue generation from the remaining assets going into ’19 is a very strong platform. So, what we want to do is continue to [indiscernible] that platform and get it to really behave like a platform in a metro market at 40% EBITDA margin and free cash flow positive on a 50% program, we’re knocking on that door. So, is it a three-year turnaround and done? In some ways we got to where we’re by working really hard in the first two years, doing a lot of stuff that folks would ask me to tell that what inning are we in, what inning are we in and turning this company around? I’d say look from my perspective sitting here, we’re in a good seventh inning. Is it perfect? No there’s still some things to do. For our size an organic growth, things that we could do in our body, getting pretty close to what we could be when we grow up without affecting the portfolio there. So does that help Jon?\\n\\nOperator\\nThank you. [Operator Instructions] We do have a follow-up question from Dan Kurnos with Benchmark.\\nDan Kurnos \\nJust in light of your last comment Pete maybe it's silly especially with the stock price where it is now but I know historically you've talked about making the company a lot larger we've heard from a lot of the private players that you’ve become a lot more competitive, the sales force is a lot more organized. I don't know what the ultimate exit plan is but assuming things improve would you also consider selling the company here?\\nPeter Aquino\\n It’s $64,000 question, stock price is high, my position has always been and I've said this to many of you as they get bigger for scale or get out and get bigger regarding scale maybe one deal away in terms of transformation, so like I said even after Digital and Equinix and maybe I don’t know with $700 million I guess, Cyxtera is$700 million. Syrus 1 is not that quite yet, it’s a very small neighborhood, so if we get one deal with one or size we could be 500 million or 600 million in revenue and I think that scale would be helpful in an industry literally is still sub a 1 billion. If we did that for some time as this industry grows I am confident we could be a player. Now just as that could happen for us, the person on the other side of the table is thinking the same thing, if they could have us inside they can be number four in the industry, 5. pick it right? So I'm open-minded and I'm trying to increase value in this company for our shareholders I'm not emotionally attached to which way we go, I am very concerned about increasing the value of the company and certainly not selling it for stress, so keeping it healthy again raising that equity, looking at refi , keeping the engines running hot here is all we get in position to have a conversation potentially through M&A that is the best answer for shareholders and I've done this, this is my third rodeo in a public company and both of those companies were subscale, we've added assets to all of them along the way and then there was an exit for the shareholders at a hopefully at a premium I think they improved it that they enjoy. Today, it feels like 2008 to me and it's depressing for me and 7 other CEOs that I talk to constantly. But if we are running a healthy company and we're staying in position and in discussion over M&A is the right answer when we are not the stress either together or collectively then I want to be in position and I have that conversation I want to pass diligence which this company could not have done and as you many of you know did not do two to three years ago, could not pass diligence. So my job here I think is to make sure we can pass diligence get in position and then run this company for the long-term whether we do it ourselves or we are the best fit if somebody who wants to get bigger I want to be in position to be worthy acquire or [acquire]. I know this didn’t answer your question exactly but that's what I am thinking. \\nDan Kurnos \\nNo, it's good to get your thoughts and you're positioning on go forward here given, what you talked about in terms of turnaround innings and then just on -- just quickly on the non-core assets without putting a specific size on it and without addressing what you have already touched on, is there the potential if you do unlock something like an Ubersmith to have incremental capital to put towards either debt pay down or share repurchase or go after incremental growth or largely any incremental asset sales we should view as likely to be reinvested in the business?\\nPeter Aquino\\nWell some of the smaller assets in Ubersmith is on the smaller side relatively speaking, will not be enough ammunition to do much with, but the other assets we have are. Ubersmith is a unique niche player and its reputation is getting better every day. But to sell that company and think that we could do really big things with those proceeds probably not right. So, it’s not for sale so to speak. But I'm thinking bigger and if we get in a position to go bigger again with market conditions may be improving for the other side they got to pay for it. Maybe bigger is better for me because we get both, we get a little debt pay down, and we pat our coffers for growth. And we will see. We are working on it.\\n\\nDan Kurnos \\nSell the cloud, reinvest in colo Pete? It's been a while since we had those conversations, right?\\nPeter Aquino\\nWell originally, cloud was iWeb long ago. So that was original thought but iWeb is improving too. And iWeb at the end of day is going to be iWeb SingleHop and something called INAP cloud is going to be all improved on the same platform that SingleHop brought and it’s going to be moving up, moving up the line from SMB up to media and business or better. So we have work to do. And it’s not always obvious. But good deals are done when we have two CEOs that are trying to accomplish something at the same time and if it’s win-win we could help each other. So we are just trying to do that.\\nOperator\\nWell, ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in the question-and-answer portion of today's call. I would now like to turn the call back over to management for any closing remarks.\\nPeter Aquino\\nWell, thank you operator and thank you everyone for this call today. I wish you all a merry Christmas, a happy Hanukkah, a happy New Year, happy holidays and in any event and safe travels stay healthy. Thank you very much.\\nOperator\\nLadies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference. This concludes the program. You may all disconnect and have a wonderful day.\"]}\n"

Such was not surprising given the extreme oversold condition in the market. More importantly, throughout market history, the biggest bull rallies have occurred during bear markets. \\n\\n Yesterday\\'s relief rally was simply that. As shown in the chart below, following the breakdown of the market from its consolidation pattern in October and November, the market plunged 20% from its previous all-time highs. Despite the massive surge in stocks yesterday, all the market managed to do was recoup 2 days of losses. \\n\\n From the previous peak in early December, the market has yet to even achieve a 38.2% retracement of that decline. It would not be surprising to see this rally try and recoup a full 61.8% of the decline over the next several weeks. However, that may not even be enough to solve the biggest risk to the market currently. In 2010, as Ben Bernanke was preparing to unleash the second round of \"Quantitative Easing\" upon the economy, he noted specifically the goal was to increase the \"wealth effect\" in order to assist the nascent economic recovery that was underway. What exactly does that mean? The wealth effect is a theory suggesting that when the value of equity portfolios are on the rise because of accelerating stock prices, individuals feel more comfortable and confident about their wealth, which will cause them to spend more.\" - Investopedia This targeting of the \"wealth effect\" became known as the Fed\\'s \"Third Mandate\" which remains alive and well today as recently noted by Bill Dudley during a speech at the BIS Annual General Meeting:\\n As I see it, financial conditions are a key transmission channel of monetary policy because they affect households\\' and firms\\' saving and investment plans and thus influence economic activity and the economic outlook.\" Over the last decade, successive rounds of both monetary and fiscal policy in the U.S. has created an inflation of asset prices to historic levels. \\n\\n The problem, as I have shown previously, is that it failed to translate across the broader economic spectrum as intended. Instead, it simply boosted the wealth of the wealthiest 10% of Americans. \\n\\n This was also shown in a recent study by the World Economic Forum on negative wealth. To wit: With respect to assets, we ask respondents how much money is in their defined contribution plan(s) - including 401(k), 403(b), 457 or thrift savings plans - and Individual Retirement Arrangement accounts, which cover the most common channels through which Americans save for retirement. We also ask the respondents about their total savings and investments, such as money in their checking accounts, stocks, and other financial instruments they may possess. Homeowners are asked to self-appraise the current value of their home. Finally, we ask for self-appraised valuations of any additional land, businesses, vehicles, or other assets the respondent\\'s household may own. The measure of total assets is then the sum of financial wealth, retirement wealth, home value, and other assets.\"\\n So, what did the results show after a decade of booming asset prices? The chart below displays, in the leftmost column, the average and median asset and debt levels for households with non-negative wealth. The next three columns display the same statistics separately for each tercile of negative-wealth households, for example, the second column illustrates the data for those with the least negative wealth and the final column reflects households with the most negative wealth. The very low median levels of assets for all negative-wealth households are readily apparent, as are the large average and median debt amounts among households with larger negative wealth.\" \\n\\n The lack of distribution of wealth across the economy explains why growth, outside the short-term impact of natural disasters and deficit spending, has remained so weak. \\n\\n  More importantly, if we assume that inflation remains stagnant at 2%, as the Fed hopes, this would mean a real rate of return of just 0.5%. Economic growth matters, and it matters a lot. As an investor, it is important to remember that in the end corporate earnings and profits are a function of the economy and not the other way around. Historically, GDP growth and revenues have grown at roughly equivalent rates.\"  Wealth Effect Runs In Reverse Of course, the problem for the Fed, who are now in the process of reversing a decade of monetary stimulus, is when the \"wealth effect\" reverses. As noted by my friend Doug Kass:\\n  The prospects for economic and profit growth are waning in the face of the rapid drop in stock prices. According to Wilshire Associates, the U.S. stock market fell by $2.1 trillion last week. That loss in value is more than 10% of the 2017 U.S. Gross Domestic Production (GDP) of $19.3 trillion. (Our domestic GDP represents approximately 31% of world GDP). The loss in value from the September 2018 market top is well in excess of $5 trillion, representing about 25% of projected 2018 U.S. GDP. The fixed income\\'s message of slowing economic and profit growth has been resounding - and until recently has been dismissed by most who were intoxicated by rising equity prices and favorable (but lagging) economic data. Given the steady drumbeat of disappointing high-frequency economic data that suggest consensus growth expectations are too optimistic and underscore the fragile state of the domestic economy, this is a particularly untimely period for stocks to crater. The economy - from a rate of change standpoint - is now at a critical point. No doubt a lot of damage to forward 2019 economic growth has already occurred and will result in a reduction in consensus profit forecasts.\"  Of course, Doug is absolutely correct and we have already been consistently warning about the downdraft in forward earnings expectations which still remain way too elevated. As shown below, the forward estimates for 2019 have already fallen by more than $13/share and will likely hit our target of $146 by early next year. \\n\\n By the way, that decline will wipe out the entire benefit of the \"tax cuts.\" But that decline in profitability should not be surprising given the decline in confidence among consumers. Our friends at Upfina recently penned an interesting piece on this point:\\n  The consumer expectations index minus the current situation index in the consumer confidence report is signaling a recession is coming. We are reviewing where consumer spending is headed by showing the differential between expectations and the current situation. As you can see from the chart below, the current differential is worse than the last cycle but still higher than the 1990s cycle. Recessions come after this indicator bottoms, and there isn\\'t much room for it to fall further.\"  The chart below is a slightly different variation of Upfina\\'s which shows the composite index of both University of Michigan and the Conference Board measures of confidence. However, the results are virtually the same with the difference between forward expectations and current conditions ringing in at levels that have normally preceded recessions. \\n\\n Given that GDP is roughly 70% consumption, deterioration in economic confidence is a hugely important factor. Rising interest rates which bite into discretionary cash flows, falling house and stock prices, and job losses weigh heavily on spending decisions by consumers. Reductions in spending reduce corporate profitability which leads to lower asset prices, so forth, and so on, until the cycle is complete. \\n\\n None of this should be surprising, of course, as we head into 2019. We saw record low levels of unemployment and jobless claims. Record high levels of sentiment on many different measures. However, as I wrote in August of this year:\\n \\'Record levels\\' of anything are \\'records for a reason.\\'\" Remember:  Bull markets END when everything is as \"good as it can get.\" Bear markets END when things simply can\\'t \"get any worse.\"  Currently, we are in the early stages of the transition from \"bull\" to \"bear.\" As investors begin to understand the magnitude of their losses in \"dollar\" terms, the impact to confidence will become an important headwind for the market. With higher rates already curtailing home and auto purchases, falling asset values will likely start to weigh more significantly on other purchasing decisions. This was a point made by Bloomberg yesterday: The outlook [for additional rate hikes], however, is likely to be tempered by market volatility as falling stocks hurt consumption by reducing household wealth. Business confidence is damaged as volatility rises, the cost of capital increases, and uncertainty over government policies - be it a trade war or an assault on the Fed - forestalls investment.\" Confidence drives everything. Which also continues to suggest the risk of a recessionary onset in 2019 has risen markedly in recent months. In other words, it is quite likely the recent roar of the \"bear\" is not the last we are going to hear.\\n']}\n"

Looking forward to 2019, the REIT should continue to benefit from favorable demographic trends, and strong market fundamentals in its major markets. In addition, it has several development projects that should reach completion in the second half of 2019. The company pays a sustainable 3.2%-yielding dividend. However, its shares are slightly overvalued. Given the uncertain macroeconomic conditions in 2019, we believe investors should patiently wait for a better entry point. \\n\\n EQR data by YCharts Recent Developments In Q3 2018, Equity Residential delivered normalized FFO of $0.83 per share. This was an increase of 3.8% year over year. The difference is due primarily to an increase in same-store net operating income, lease-up NOI but offset by higher interest expense. In Q3 2018, the company’s SPNOI increased by 1.7% and its average rental rate increased by 2.1% thanks to healthy demand in its major markets. Reasons why we continue to like Equity Residential in 2019 Market fundamentals in its major markets are very strong Equity Residential is focused in seven markets in the United States: Seattle, San Francisco, Southern California, Boston, New York, Washington, D.C., and Denver. Except Denver, most of its properties are located in the major urban and suburban markets in the Pacific West Coast and Atlantic East Coast. As can be seen from the map below, these 6 major markets represents 99% of its net operating income in Q3 2018.\\n \\n\\n Source: Investor Presentation These markets have much higher population growth rate than other markets largely due to strong job growth. In fact, employment growth rate in almost all of its major markets are projected to be higher than the national average through 2022 (see charts below). \\n\\n Boston Market (Source: Investor Presentation) \\n\\n New York City Market (Source: Investor Presentation) \\n\\n Washington, D.C. Market (Source: Investor Presentation) \\n\\n Seattle Market (Source: Investor Presentation) This favorable market fundamental is also evident in PwC’s recently published report on the prospect of 2019 real estate markets in the United States and Canada. In the article, PwC surveyed different real estate developers on the prospect of major cities/markets in the United States and ranked them by investor demand in 2019. As can be seen from the table below, Equity Residential’s major markets (highlighted in the table below) are among the top markets in the list.\\n \\n\\n Source: Emerging Trends in Real Estate 2019 Favorable demographic trend In PwC’s latest report, the organization also observed the trend of younger generation population that seems to prefer rent to owning homes. As can be seen from the chart below, homeownership rates by age of household in the United States have gradually declined in the past two decades. PwC believes that this has to do with many people, whether retired or millennial, who prefer to live in “high-end, highly amenitized, connected, urban-chic communities.” We believe Equity Residential’s focus in high-density urban and suburban markets will benefit greatly from this new demographic trend in the United States. \\n\\n Source: Emerging Trends in Real Estate 2019 Several development projects should reach completion in 2019 Equity Residential has several projects currently under developments. As can be seen from the table below, two of its projects should reach completion in the second half of 2019. This should help grow its rental revenue in the second half of 2019. These projects should help increase its total rental units by 0.5% (including the project in Washington D.C. that should reach completion in Q4 2018). \\n\\n\\n Source: Q3 2018 Financial Report Healthy balance sheet Equity Residential has an investment grade balance sheet. The REIT has credit ratings of “A3“ and “A-” from Moody’s and S&P respectively. Over the past 5 years, the REIT has reduced its net debt to EBITDAre ratio from 6.8x in 2013 to 5.3x in Q3 2018. Its interest coverage of 4.5x is also quite good. \\n\\n Source: Investor Presentation The REIT’s weighted average debt maturity of 8.2 years is better than the average of 7.6 years of its peers (see chart below). This lengthy debt maturity year is advantageous as it reduces the risk of increasing its interest expense sharply in a rising interest rate environment. \\n\\n Source: Investor Presentation Valuation Shares of Equity Residential have traded between $55 and $72 in the past year. The company is expected to generate funds from operations of $3.15 per share. We project its 2019 FFO to be about $3.30 per share. At the current price of $67.22, its price to 2019 estimated FFO ratio is about 20.4x. This is towards the high end of its five-year historical range of 14.4x ~ 22.8x. Hence, we think its shares are slightly overvalued. 3.2%-yielding dividend Earlier in 2018, Equity Residential increased its quarterly dividend to $0.54 per share. This is equivalent to an increase of about 7%. In the past five years, the company has increased its dividend by about 6% annually. Its current dividend yield is about 3.2%.\\n \\n\\n EQR Dividend Yield (TTM) data by YCharts Risks and Challenges Asset recycling program Equity Residential has done well in the past to sell its properties and purchase new properties at higher capitalization rates. However, this strategy may become more challenging as capitalization rate has compressed considerably in the past few years. Macroeconomic risk Although people always need to find a place to live, it will be challenging for Equity Residential to raise rental rates in an economic downturn. This is because layoffs will likely result in lower demand for apartment rentals. Elevated supply risk Strong demand for apartments in the past few years has resulted in elevated supply in many markets in the U.S. If these markets are not able to absorb the new supply (e.g. lower demand due to lower economic growth rate), it may become challenging for Equity Residential to raise its rental rate. In fact, supply is expected to be higher in 2019 in most of Equity Residential’s major markets except Boston and New York. \\n\\n Source: Investor Presentation Investor Takeaway We believe Equity Residential should continue to do well in 2019 thanks to favorable demographic trend, and strong market fundamentals in its major markets. However, its shares are slightly overvalued. Given the recent market volatility, investors may want to wait on the sideline and patiently find the right entry point. Note: This is not financial advice and that all financial investments carry risks. Investors are expected to seek financial advice from professionals before making any investment.\\n\\nDisclosure: I/we have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

Amazon’s (AMZN) Indian business comes under FDI classification. While the company was given permission for marketplace model only and FDI was never permitted in inventory based model in India; Amazon was bypassing certain rules citing the lack of clarity and investing in third-party sellers, effectively allowing it to follow an inventory based model. Amazon has mentioned its ownership of indirect interests in third-party Indian sellers in its risk factors.    For www.amazon.in, we provide certain marketing tools and logistics services to third-party sellers to enable them to sell online and deliver to customers, and we hold indirect minority interests in entities that are third-party sellers on the www.amazon.in marketplace. Although we believe these structures and activities comply with existing laws, they involve unique risks. There are substantial uncertainties regarding the interpretation of Indian laws and regulations, and it is possible that these governments will ultimately take a view contrary to ours.  Source: Amazon 10-K The company has mentioned that it believed that these structures were in compliance with the existing laws. But after the Indian Government’s clarification, I don’t think there is any ambiguity and Amazon’s view was wrong. Below are the relevant contents from the policy document.\\n     FDI is not permitted in inventory based model of e-commerce. An entity having equity participation by e-commerce marketplace entity or its group companies, or having control on its inventory by e-commerce marketplace entity or its group companies, will not be permitted to sell its products on the platform run by such marketplace entity.  Source: Press Information Bureau, Government of India In addition to not allowing minority interest in vendors, Indian Government has also prohibited vendors from selling more than 25% of their goods through a single marketplace entity. If a vendor sells more than 25% of its goods through a marketplace entity; it will be deemed that marketplace entity effectively controls that vendor’s inventory and is following an inventory-based model. This will force vendors selling on Amazon to look at other possible channels adversely affecting Amazon business. Here is the relevant text: E-commerce entity providing a marketplace will not exercise ownership or control over the inventory i.e. goods purported to be sold. Such an ownership or control over the inventory will render the business into inventory based model. Inventory of a vendor will be deemed to be controlled by e-commerce marketplace entity if more than 25% of purchases of such vendor are from the marketplace entity or its group companies.  One of the biggest sellers on Amazon India is Cloudtail India. It is a joint venture between an Indian company Catamaran and Amazon. Last year, Cloudtail’s sales were Indian Rupee 7,149 crores or slightly more than $1 billion on Amazon India. Cloudtail has been a major contributor to Amazon’s growth in India and derives its majority of sales from Amazon’s platform. After recent clarification, Amazon will not only have to exit Cloudtail but also ensure it winds down Cloudtail’s sales from its platform to conform to 25% rule. This is going to be a headwind for the company’s business which is still in nascent stage in India and faces tough competition from Walmart (WMT) owned Flipkart.\\n Like Amazon’s relationship with Cloudtail, Flipkart also used to have a similar arrangement with WS Retail. However, over the last few years, Flipkart made a conscious effort to wind down sales from WS Retail to ensure compliance with the Indian law. Winding down of WS Retail’s sales from Flipkart’s platform was one of the major reasons behind Amazon’s outperformance in India and its Gross Merchandise Value surpassing Flipkart. Now with Government’s clarification, Amazon will be in a disadvantageous position versus Flipkart. Further, Government is also taking steps against deep discounting and promotions and asked e-commerce entities to maintain a level playing field and not directly or indirectly influence the sale price of goods or services. E-commerce marketplace entity will also not be allowed to enter exclusive deals with vendors/manufacturers to sell on their platforms. These steps highlight increased risks for the company. Amazon has already invested ~$ 5 billion in India and is incurring significant losses. The Government’s new regulations are a massive blow for the company’s India business which is also facing stiff competition from Flipkart. India is not the only country where Amazon faces regulatory risks. Similar risks exist in China and the company has outlined them in its 10-K filings. Most of them relate to interpretation and enforcement of the law. Ongoing tariff war between the U.S. and China also increases the potential of adverse outcomes in China. Despite a ~30% pullback in shares of Amazon, it continues to be priced at a level where setbacks will be punished. I believe investors are pricing in not just years but decades of high top-line growth and everything going in the right direction. However, of late, there are several risks emerging for the company. In a previous article, I described how the company’s efforts are not paying off for its grocery business where all Brick and Mortar grocers are coming together to fight off Amazon. Regulatory risk in India and other countries, especially China, is another thing investors should watch out for.\\n\\nDisclosure: I/we have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

These weak margins were not expected and are attributable to a one-off clearance event that occurred towards the end of 2Q and beginning of 3Q to clean out unproductive inventory. The focus on investment in the salon segment and the low-margin prestige brands also contributed. We like the ULTA story – it’s a best in class retail growth story which offers a differentiated experience for its customers. We also do like the fact that ULTA is relatively e-commerce proof due to its control over distribution. As ULTA continues to roll out new stores, we think comps will continue to be stable. However, we’re concerned on margins as continued investments in stores/ labor, and infrastructure costs could drag near-term. We’re long-term fans but, with valuations at~22x trailing PE, there’s no rush to initiate a position, and we remain on hold. Decent operational performance was offset by lower than expected gross and EBIT margins; yet, the growth in profitability continued in 3Q18 as EPS beat consensus ULTA total revenues for 3Q18 were in-line with consensus with a 16.2% growth yoy reaching $1,560m. EPS came at $0.02 ($2.18) above consensus as a result of a lower tax rate for the company. The focus on investment in 2018 coupled with a clearance event at the end of 2Q and beginning of 3Q led to lower than expected gross profit for ULTA in 3Q18 as it missed consensus by 1.1% reaching $572.3m (a 16% growth yoy) with margins of 36.7% versus the consensus of 37.0%. Moreover, the company’s EBIT was slightly better than its gross profit, albeit missing consensus by 0.7% to reach $169.2m during the quarter, a 4% growth yoy.\\n Profitability continued to improve as a result of a lower tax rate of 23.1% versus the consensus of 24.1% which resulted in better than expected net income of $131.2m, a 1.1% above consensus and 25% growth yoy. This translated into earnings per share reaching $2.18, 0.9% above consensus and 28% growth yoy. Segment results: All segments witnessed strong sales growth in 3Q18 and, in particular, E-comm sales. ULTA had strong sales growth in all segments with sales of E-comm leading the way by reaching $170.7m for 3Q18, a 42.5% growth yoy. Moreover, retail sales and salon sales also witnessed growth during this quarter reaching $1,315.3m and $74m, respectively, which translates into a 14% and 10.6% growth yoy. Double-digit comp growth in prestige products; such as prestige skincare, prestige boutique brands, and prestige cosmetics were critical contributors to the broad-based growth.  \\n\\n (Source: Author) When looking at store sales, the ability of ULTA to generate traffic to new stores was reflected in the 20% yoy increase in new stores’ sales reaching $113m. At the same time, adding new brands and products drove comp store sales up by 16% yoy to $1,447m. \\n\\n (Source: Author) The strong sales and market share growth and reaping the benefits of the investments during the coming years will boost ULTA’s margins and profitability Since the start of 2018, ULTA focused on investments in low-margin prestige brands and the salon segment. This led to new stores and beauty products sales growth and the capturing of more market share. Also, ULTA’s ability to introduce differentiated shopping experience to its customers was the catalyst for attracting the younger and more diverse customers to its Kylie products which is a big boost for future growth.\\n Besides, the anticipated launch of four Kim Kardashian West fragrances during the holiday season and the start-up investments in Glam Street and QM Scientific emphasize the company’s focus on innovation in the near to long-term future.  Improved liquidity provides a solid basis for future investments  During 3Q18, ULTA improved its operational cash generation and reduced its capital expenditures which led to a total of $296.9m of cash and cash equivalents on its balance sheet. Its CFO came in at $154.2m, a 39% increase over 2Q18. Also, free cash flow, although lower than 2Q18, still grew by a whopping 212% over 3Q17. This puts the company in a strong position for future expansions and investments. Disappointing 4Q18 comp guidance ULTA management gave comp guidance for 4Q18 of 7-8%. Although it might seem like healthy and robust growth, it came below consensus (+8.3%) and implied a midpoint deceleration of 180bps on a two-year basis. The slowdown was disappointing given the positive events taking place in 4Q; such as the launch of Kylie cosmetics, which makes us believe that management is taking the conservative side with this guidance. Although current margins were below consensus, it is mainly due to a one-time clearance event that took place towards the end of 2Q and the beginning of 3Q and the management’s focus on investments during this year. Thus, with the solid backdrop of growth in beauty products, prestige brands, and the new Kylie brand, ULTA will be able to sustain its growth story in the future and capture more market share. Conclusion Although we do like the premier retail growth story on offer, we’re concerned about margin pressure. More specifically, we’re worried investments in stores/ labor, and infrastructure costs will continue to be a near-term overhang to offset strong comps. At ~22x trailing PE, we like this long-term, but we don’t think there’s any rush to initiate a position, and we remain on hold.\\nDisclosure: I/we have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

I believe we\\'re years away from seeing the true, transcontinental, trans-systemic value of these coins. So when I hear people talk or write about a global recession bringing Bitcoin prices back near their all-time high, I just shake my head. Bitcoin will need to prove its value beyond being NOT a national currency.  Let\\'s look at some reasons here. For one, any correlation that people assume between the traditional market and Bitcoin has been shown not to exist. Here\\'s a chart matching BTC prices with the S&P Performance trailing 180 days before Dec. 2. \\n\\n What we see is that there\\'s zero correlation between the S&P and Bitcoin. So we can\\'t continue with a narrative of an inverse correlation or have any realistic hope of seeing it beyond a wish.  In reality, as this article points out, Bitcoin is likely to behave closer to how other markets might as its buying advantage hinges on wealth having been created and looking for a diversification route.  As Christoper Brookins, a managing partner at Pugilist Ventures wrote, \"First, BTC and other \\'name brand\\' cryptos will decrease demonstrably in value initially due to capital flight to \\'safe assets\\' and likely rising real interest rates.\"\\n Further, as this article points out, hurt investors from a global recession are unlikely to race toward a riskier, less centralized currency option. This was furthered as an argument by Dan McArdle, the co-founder of crypto analysis site Messari, who pointed out that Bitcoin exists as a \"speculative asset.\" Moreover, his first point is that Bitcoin is a \"hedge against inflation and loss of confidence in fiat\" which is different than a plummeting market of traditional asset investment.  He goes on to point out, \"We saw this with gold in 08/09 (it tanked). What subsequently led to gold\\'s 2011 all-time-high run was people wanting to hedge European (ans other) fiat-collapse scenarios.\" The Optimistic Case Still, there\\'s an optimistic case to be made for investment bodies to consider investments in Bitcoin or other currencies, especially if traditional markets aren\\'t providing returns.  As author Anthony Pompliano points out, \"Bitcoin has an asymmetric return profile — there is much more upside than downside in owning the asset. The downside (loss of capital) is capped at the total amount of capital invested, yet the upside is ~100X+ (if Bitcoin only becomes gold equivalent).\" This is true. We\\'ve seen the high side of Bitcoin and we\\'ve seen BTC be as low as less than a cent (which has made Bitcoin an outstanding asset if you bought some in the beginning, which very few did).  Pompliano\\'s article says that pension funds should buy Bitcoin. And he makes a case for it (linked with his name). Still, for funds to do so, they\\'ll want and, in most cases, need regulations and protection. These do not exist for Bitcoin and countries have yet to come together to work toward them in a serious way. As such, Bitcoin is just a risk that some investors are willing to take, but most are not.  Still, to suppose that Bitcoin will usurp centralized control is a long-term pipe dream at this point. It certainly could happen, but a global recession is unlikely to be the unlock that some are speculating. It\\'s likelier to be a healthy government or central bank that uses some of its reserves to bank in Bitcoin as a hedge against its wealth. That\\'s years away. \\n What Needs To Happen First And before all of that, investors — whether they be individuals, institutions, or banking firms — need to have a proper on-ramp into crypto. This has been the Achilles Heel of the market for years now and even if Coinbase can boast a friendly UX, it doesn\\'t instill investor confidence in its holdings. So, the launch of Coinbase\\'s partnership with financial companies like Wealthfront is a move in the right direction. The launch of Bakkt, with tie-ins to the Intercontinental Exchange (ICE) is another one — should it ever launch.  Bitcoin may have come down from the stratosphere, but there’s still an abundance of opportunities in cryptocurrencies.

Those that have read me for a long time know that I’m not a fan of Keynesian theory, nor am I a fan of the government micromanaging the stock market and basing monetary policy off of small moves in the market.  \\n\\n^DJI data byYCharts  While the market did see a 20% pullback over the last couple of weeks, Steve Mnuchin\\'s proposed solution of publicizing talks with banks to confirm their liquidity was probably the worst possible idea he could’ve come up with. Further, bringing the plunge protection team into the discussion only wound up making investors panic further and talk about the drop more then they would have if he kept his mouth shut and just let the market done what it needed to do. Not only did this grave mistake, in my opinion, cost the market another 600 points on Christmas Eve, it also drew ire from the president, reportedly, who is now \"unhappy\" with Mnuchin. \\n\\nThe fact of the matter is that markets are supposed to go both up and down and panicking on a 20% pull back after the market has nearly tripled after the last crisis is a ridiculous thing to do.

There’s one thing though, Apple is not dead, and even more bizarre, the calls of its death are in fact, literally, illogical. Story So many stories have come out about Apple’s iPhone demand from suppliers, both in earnings calls and the media, that we have to give some credence to the data. It does appear iPhone sales this holiday season will slow and could be lower than where estimates stood before just a few months ago. But, some conclusions have been drawn that are not just wrong, they are, in fact, illogical. But before that, we can get into some more positive news. Remember Android Switchers? Apple CEO Tim Cook has noted Android switchers, those people switching from an Android phone to an iPhone, for quite a while. His allusion to these switchers points to the fact that the smart phone market doesn’t actually have to grow in the United States, Apple still has about half of the market it can reach to — those on Android phones. CNBC has reported that a report by Consumer Intelligence Research Partners found that in the 30 days after the iPhone XR was released, 16 percent of U.S. iPhone buyers upgraded from Android phones. To put that number into context, we have this snippet (our emphasis added): After the iPhone 8 and 8s were released in Sept. 2017, 12 percent of iPhone buyers upgraded from an Android phone, and when the iPhone X was released in Nov. 2017, that number was 11 percent.\\n So, it does appear that those Android switchers are accelerating, meaning Apple is adding yet more people to its massive active user base. The Illogical Conclusion Apple made a splash, the bad kind, in its last earnings call when it announced it would no longer share iPhone unit sales (nor iPad). That was a move to less transparency and likely a move to hide the reality that unit sales have stagnated and will stagnate. The company moved higher by showing large increases in average selling prices (NYSE:ASP), but that strategy obviously has an end, at some point. Apple countered the negative narrative on the last earnings call, which was some truth and some spin. Apple has clearly moved away from being just a phone company — or at least it wants the world to feel that way. The CFO did say rather clearly that iPhone unit sales have had essentially no correlation with the stock price for the last year. The point here is that Apple is now an ecosystem company and within that ecosystem it sells phones, tablets, personal computers, laptops, various wearables, and several services. The unit sales of a particular piece of that ecosystem are not truly meaningful — what is meaningful is the actual total sum revenue number and earnings numbers. To that point, Apple will be more transparent than before with respect to the second biggest piece of that ecosystem, which is Services. Apple also noted that it continued to see strong growth in paid subscriptions reaching over 330 million. But here’s where the illogical conclusions from the bears come. The argument goes that if iPhone until sales growth slows, or even worse, shrinks, then the Services business too will shrink, since those users are mostly iPhone owners. Now stop for a second and see if you can spot the illogical conclusion. Apple’s unit sales growth is slowing because people are upgrading their phones much less often. So, let’s say Apple sells 200 million iPhone phones this year, perhaps next year it sells just 170 million — that would be shrinkage, right?\\n No, not right. That would be shrinkage in growth. If Apple sells 170 million iPhones next year, irrespective of how many the company sold last year, that is 170 million more phones. That is, some will be Apple users upgrading to newer phones, and some, obviously, will be Android switchers. While the growth in units will shrink, the user base will almost certainly grow — and grow substantially. Wall Street has gotten its underwear turned around and drawn an equivalency between slowing growth and losing users. That is not the case. And, how do we know this is not the case? How about data?… Data Is the Truth While Apple’s unit sales last quarter were essentially unchanged from last year, here’s what happened to Services, straight from the last earnings call: We set new Q4 records in all of our geographic segments and new all-time revenue records for the App Store, cloud services, AppleCare, Apple Music and Apple Pay. We also got these gems:  * Our installed base is growing at double digit[s] * Apple Pay is by far the number one mobile contactless payment service worldwide. * Apple Pay generated significantly more transactions than even PayPal Mobile with over 4 times the growth rate. * We generated record Q4 earnings [from] services, and wearables drove our momentum and we produced strong double-digit revenue growth in all of our geographic segments. So, you see, slowing unit sales does not mean Services is doomed, or that it has peaked. Slowing growth does not mean fewer iPhone users — quite the contrary.  It’s a good reminder that when the bear market arrives, logic tends to depart. Let’s not be those people. Conclusion The reality is that Apple has become less transparent and that is not as good for investors. But, that’s all that happened last quarter — that was all of the “bad” news. Apple is crushing it in almost every area, and if the company needs to start hiding unit sales to change its own focal point internally — fine, let it do so.

It\\'s easy to become a Seeking Alpha contributor and share your best investment ideas. Active contributors also get free access to the SA PRO archive. Click here to find out more » The future of Bitcoin and other digital coins, as well as their expected value, seems to be based as much on reason as on faith, and there are strongly opposed views. In contrast, even among those who are skeptical about the different coins, many argue that the underlying blockchain technology will become pervasive and is sound. I\\'ll argue it is not. The reasoning in favor boils down mostly to three premises: (1) that just as with the internet in its infancy, it\\'s easy to underestimate the future impact of blockchain technology; (2) on the soundness of the Satoshi Nakamoto algorithm (SNa); and (3) that it will result in vast benefits in many areas. Blockchains are the foundational technology that underlies all cryptocurrencies, and they shared a common birth: A white paper that outlined a novel currency (\"Bitcoin\") and a novel algorithm (\"Blockchain\"). Further developments of the blockchain algorithms enabled using blockchains for purposes well beyond just cryptocurrencies. The following arguments against blockchains are completely unrelated to the ups or downs of cryptocurrencies, and are based instead on (a) the dynamics of networks of miners, and (b) that the further benefits attributed to blockchains are overstated. 1. Parallels with the Internet The parallel with the internet is the weakest of the arguments, and not a serious one, so I\\'ll get it out of the way first: although the magnitude of the eventual impact of new technologies is rarely fathomed at their early stages - whether the internet, the web, computers, penicillin, etc. - most new technologies do not succeed in such a significant way. From promising new drugs that fail third-stage trials to novel materials, unbeatable startups, or clever algorithms that should revolutionize some area, most actually either fail altogether or end up having negligible impact. However, most failures are less spectacular, and certainly less glorious than triumphs. Hence, they tend to get less press. Failed experiments rarely get published in the academic journals, and in general, it\\'s success that gets echoed and amplified by the general press and the web.\\n For example, some of the hubris around Bitcoin, or its potential, depending on one\\'s perspective, continues to get amplified by companies and individuals who gain as long as others keep trading it, but do not necessarily own Bitcoin themselves. Every new idea, naturally, has to go through infancy and teething, but being in such a stage is hardly a predictor of success. Making a parallel between the future of blockchain and the growth of the internet is unfounded: The only true parallels are that both deal with bits and that both had an infancy. But we could make equally unfounded parallels with any number of protocols that went by the wayside without leaving a trace, or in general with other technologies that looked incredibly promising at the outset, but ultimately failed. In conclusion, the success of the internet tells us little about the future of blockchain - one way or another. 2. On the soundness of SNa and Blockchains So now let\\'s look at a harder issue: whether SNa is a solid foundation for a revolution or just the basis for another interesting, distributed database. I will not go into whether central banks or fiat currencies are good or bad, nor whether privacy, traceability, or security matter, because I will attempt to show that neither SNa nor its variants provide an advantage over ex-SNa technologies. If so, all these other economic and social issues can continue to be debated, but independently of SNa. To further clarify what I consider as ex-SNa: all types of databases, including centralized, distributed, mirrored, etc.; backup systems, redundancy, and recovery systems and protocols; communication protocols, including consensus mechanisms and any other update and software or hardware-based commit mechanisms; encryption; tamper-detection mechanisms, including incremental hashes; and in general, every other technology, with the exception of SNa. The key weakness is not in SNa itself. The algorithm is sound and works well. Moreover, some of its limitations in terms of speed, space, or energy are being addressed with clever variants. However, those variants use more or less obvious side channels, weaker protocols than SNa, or other ex-SNa mechanisms to funnel information. Hence, they leave the transactions as exposed as ex-SNa - at least for some periods of time. They are more obscure, and possibly harder to attack than, for example, leaving Bitcoins in a hot wallet, but still vulnerable. Some variants provide for \"self-executing\" and exceptionally safe contracts - certainly clever and useful. However, such use requires a solid underlying blockchain.\\n SNa is an algorithm that delivers valid answers with such a high degree of confidence that under normal conditions, we can trust them. However, this reliability is not unconditional: It relies on the assumption that there is a large set of independent, non-colluding miners, in which no miner (or syndicate of miners) controls over half the network. Miners are the entities that run the SNa and cooperate to update the blockchain. SNa allows for anybody to become a miner, and participate in the blockchain updates, while still preserving its integrity. That\\'s the beauty of SNa. The weakness lies in the fact that nothing in SNa guarantees the dynamics of the evolution of the underlying network of miners. Nor does it provide for a safe mechanism to monitor its configuration at any given point in time. The network can evolve into a desired configuration if there are enough incentives for large numbers of independent parties to participate actively. But nothing precludes, due to benefits of scale, for example, for larger participants to gain market share (i.e., computing share in the blockchain), leading to an oligopolistic situation, or worse to a dominant miner. Furthermore such coalescence process can be overt or, more dangerously, covert. Another way in which a network of miners can shift to an undesirable configuration is when the profits to be made, instead of expanding, shrink. As long as growth in the profits to be made outruns the ability of new entrants to join the fray, the network will keep growing. However, at some point, competition must reduce margins, and aside from consolidation, the other possibilities for the network are gradual stabilization, withering, or given the non-linearities of the system and the many feedback loops, possibly collapse. It is interesting to note that although this is just one data point, with the Bitcoin price collapse in late 2018, a number of miners stopped providing mining services altogether, and simply sold their hardware. Collapse may mean that a given blockchain stops operating or, just as bad, that it continues to operate, but under a controlling party.\\n 3. About the Many Benefits of Blockchains Some blockchain variants support uses beyond those of Bitcoin (BTC-USD). Initially Bitcoin was touted as an efficient and inexpensive way to make payments and transfer money. Interestingly, it was lauded both for providing full traceability and also anonymity, usually not in the same sentence. Given the original SNa and its parameters, its original goals were not attainable, resulting in the first forks (variants). Currently the claimed benefits of Bitcoin seem to have shifted towards storing value securely, while other variants focus on the other aforementioned benefits. Soon it became apparent that blockchains could securely store other sorts of information. Thus the creation of competing systems, such as Ethereum (ETH-USD) and many others. One of the obvious problems with this fracturing is that, except when it results in growth of the total underlying assets, it is dilutive and weakens the notion of digital assets as incorruptible stores of value. With Ethereum, the ability to store information such as, for example, property rights, music ownership, and particularly programs opened whole new vistas: self-executing contracts, automatic payment of royalties, secure ownership of land titles, etc. Furthermore, all of this provided without pesky intermediaries (or otherwise at almost nominal costs) by riding on top of existing blockchains. There are two problems with this scenario: (a) blockchains are run by miners who must be compensated (they invest in machines, cover the operating costs, and presumably would like to see a profit), and (b) the blockchain is just a database, when all is said and done. To address the first issue (i.e., compensation), the blockchain must be able to attract underlying transactions of valuable assets that are traded frequently and in large volumes, and result in a cut for the miners. Usually, the traded asset is some type of cryptocurrency, as for example, Ethereum. All others can benefit, but cannot get a free ride. They have to pay for the use of this database in one way or another. However, because blockchains are computationally intensive, their operation is significantly more expensive than ex-SNa databases, so fees have to be higher. For a given blockchain, underpricing of transaction fees must self-correct, or its miners will eventually disappear. There\\'s no magic that can change that.\\n The second issue (i.e., beyond the database) requires providers who will connect the rest of the \"plumbing\". That is, the database is just one of the pieces, and so is the blockchain. By plumbing I mean everything else that allows providing a given service. To make it concrete, let\\'s look at some examples. A possible use of blockchains would be to store and manage property rights inexpensively. The narrative sometimes emphasizes the big impact this would have in the developing world, where it is more common to find primitive, incomplete, or conflicting records, and where corrupt officers can tamper records with impunity. However, under such circumstances, we need to ask ourselves where exactly would an alternate database be plugged. The tampering is not due to vulnerabilities in modern databases, but due to a lack of adequate legislation, corrupt judicial systems, and a combination of lack of competence and resources to put it all together. So let\\'s consider a place where those preconditions are satisfied. In the USA, title information is kept by each of over 3,000 counties, some parishes, etc. Each one has its own regulations and record keeping procedures. It requires a leap of imagination to think they would legislate a common system, which would then migrate to a blockchain. OK, so what about just some counties doing it? For that to happen, there are powerful headwinds: (a) the money to be made by putting together localized plumbing is less, and (b) developed world style corruption is less blatant (or at least used to be), but at all levels, money speaks. At the local level, real estate and development companies support candidates favorable to their business; title companies would do likewise if there were any risks that their livelihood would be affected. So why engage in a battle, just to replace a county\\'s database, which is just a cog in the system? Furthermore, are the issues truly in the databases? So let\\'s consider instead a leading country such as Estonia, where a significant proportion of all government-related activity is already online. Furthermore, Estonia already has built the uniform plumbing needed for easy access, and its ex-SNa databases seem to work already. Assuming that is the case for its real estate too, would this be a good candidate to migrate to the blockchain? To decide, I would ask first: What actual problem does it have, which will be solved with this alternate database?\\n Going away from real estate into music, let\\'s look at another example. ASCAP and BMI handle a large portion of the royalties owed to musicians when their music is used/performed. For this service, they keep an interesting percentage of the revenues. Some people have proposed (in general terms) blockchain-based systems through which musicians would get their due every time their music is performed, without intermediaries, and at a very low cost. Again, this ignores the need for the \"plumbing\": at the most basic, somebody needs to generate identifiers for each music piece, to detect when it is performed in any of many forms (from radio and TV, to podcasts, movies, etc.), and to channel funds from some entity to some musician. The blockchain does not do any of that; it can just store information and run a program when fed an event. So the question now becomes, who will do that, and why will they charge less than ASCAP or BMI for providing this service? Another benefit touted by SNa proponents is the democratization of ownership and operation of the blockchains. Instead of banks and other corporations owning the database, it would be owned and operated by \"the people\". You and I can become miners and join the club. The idea was nice, but the actual dynamics of the evolution of the network, and particularly of the dedicated hardware needed to participate effectively in a blockchain, rule most of us out. So it\\'s not necessarily banks, but some other corporations, which actually own and control the blockchains. So much for democratization. At the other end of the spectrum, some banks and technology companies have come up with variants ideally suited for them: Walled-gardens in which vetted miners provide the infrastructure for a blockchain. This might seem like an ideal solution for incumbents with much to lose from a potential failure. However, this does not address communications with the \"outside world\". Also, just as with the examples described above, any new functionality requires building the \"plumbing\" to support it. But adding a blockchain-based database adds complexity and cost for transactions between what are already trusted parties - and increased complexity begets increased vulnerability. Furthermore, the weak points tend to be in the periphery rather than the databases. Ex-SNa technology should not be conflated with current flaws, limitations of functionality or security, or lack of performance - these are all indicators of obsolescence. SNa does not solve legacy issues on its own: it\\'s just a secure database. So of all the things that could be improved in banking systems, why precisely this peculiar focus on the databases, as if they could unleash untold potential? Seems there are more interesting and valuable things to do in fintech and in banking systems.\\n 4. Coda Cryptocurrencies were the initial motivation behind the invention of blockchains. Some researchers, and particularly some economists, are not too enthused by cryptocurrencies. In contrast, there seems to be a much more general agreement - a consensus, almost - on the bright prospects of blockchain technology. They are expected to bring forth dramatic change - from foreign exchange transactions, to self-executing contracts, to enabling accurate record keeping of property rights and transactions all over the world. None of the arguments, nor the examples above, have the strength of a mathematical proof, which could settle the case against blockchains. However, they suggest that the future of blockchains is not so clear. Research in SNa and blockchains is unquestionably interesting, so perhaps that will perdure, a bit like the radiation left by the Big Bang. But, leaving predictions aside, while SNa is solid, actual blockchains have feet of clay. So it seems that even if not naked, the emperor may be rather lightly dressed.\\nDisclosure: I/we have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

Many of its products are tied to consumer purchasing activities which aren't showing any signs of weakness yet. With a strong retail sales report recently proving there is no slow down in consumer spending, International Paper's business is most likely booming. The company is cyclical in nature, but at these levels trades as if we are already experiencing a recession. Investors who buy shares today are locking in a historically high yield that is measurably safe. Performance International Paper continues to perform well, reporting modest growth in the most recent quarterly report. \\n\\n Source: Seeking Alpha To see how well this report actually means the company is doing, take a look below. \\n\\n Source: Investor Presentation\\n The company improved earnings quite a bit, much of which could be attributed to tax reform. This should not be discounted either as it will continue to be earning more in the future. The company not only reported impressive earnings, but it increased its dividend for the 8th year in a row now. There was a cut in 2010 but this was due to a significantly weaker economy and a significantly weaker company. International Paper has made many acquisitions that have now allowed for the company to earn much more than in the past. It also has given the company a cost advantage over many competitors to allow it to compete in a weak economic environment without losing share to lower cost producers. The company continued to improve its margin versus the 3Q of 2017, which is a positive as the earnings growth wasn't all due to revenue increase only. \\n\\n Many companies are facing significant margin pressure due to rising labor costs and higher transportation costs. In fact, IP management had highlighted this in the quarter as putting a pressure on profits. However, the company still had a very strong $584 million in free cash flow which more than covers the $200 million in dividend payments needed for the quarter. The dividend actually cost the company now going forward about $800 million per year, which is falling due to share repurchases as well. The company repurchased 1% of shares out standing in just the last quarter which will help investors going forward with lower FCF/payout ratio and a higher earnings per share metric. The company is highly tied to the food and beverage industry as well as e-commerce. \\n\\n\\n The positive of this is that as e-commerce continues to grow International Paper should continue to benefit. Additionally, there is some security in the business model as food sales don't tend to slow much during a recession. The important part is to note that 50% of the business is safer than most realize. Also, the pharma segment is secured by the needs of an aging population which will increasingly rely on increased healthcare needs. Knowing the company will benefit in the upside of a growing economy while being protected somewhat in a recessionary economy should give investors confidence. The company continues to see a strong outlook going forward as well. \\n\\n This makes me more confident that the recent sell off was perhaps over done and was just due to general market weakness. With management highlighting and forecasting strong growth going forward, the recent 52 week lows seem like a big punishment for no reason. But as always, investors need to learn how to take advantage of the weakness. In fact the company had gone through this before with shares falling dramatically. In the beginning of 2016 when the company was earning about half as much as it is now the shares traded down to slightly below current levels. \\n\\nIP data by YCharts Getting the chance to purchase shares at levels not seen in almost three years and when the company was financially less attractive seems like an opportunity to me.\\n Lastly, the company still has $400 million remaining for share repurchases. Much of which I expect to have been used in the last few weeks of weakness in the shares. \\n\\n It is because of this and a strong capital position that I believe the company will announce a new share repurchase program in the coming quarter or two. The company highlights here the stability of its dividend as it maintains a FCF payout ratio of 40-50%. Valuation Valuation for the past five years highlights that now is a better time than ever to purchase shares. \\n\\n Source: Morningstar IP trades at a lower P/E, FP/E, P/B, P/S, P/CF, and PEG ratio than it has in the last five years. This is quite impressive and signals a buying opportunity as the company is continuing to perform well and shows no signs of slowing down. I also like to take a look at the yield historically and see if we are able to lock in an abnormally high yield. \\n\\n Source: YieldChart From what we can see above in the last 22 years, the shares traded with a 4.25% yield or higher only about 5.7% of the time. Right now shares are yielding a full percentage point above this with 5.32% current yield on cost. This should give investors confidence knowing they are getting a higher yield than practically ever before minus a few rare occurrences in which the shares rebounded to more normal levels. The average yield for IP is around 3-3.25%. Shares would rise more than 20% for the stock to trade back at levels in which its yield is average.\\n Conclusion For investors looking for opportunities among a market sell off that seems exaggerated, International Paper looks like a good bet. The maker of boxes and consumer packaging is growing its dividend, repurchasing shares, and can cover continued capital returns with its strong cash flow. Even if a recession led to a 25% haircut in free cash the company would still have ample margin of safety to continue to reward its share holders. Buying shares at a time when it hasn't been cheaper in over five years while the economy is still strong seems like an easy decision. I have recently initiated a position in the stock and will continue to monitor performance going forward.\\nDisclosure: I am/we are long IP.

The company’s shares have fallen from $32 to just $18 thanks to general market weakness, but also doubts from investors about the company’s ability to successfully execute its enormous transformation. Still, Newell offers significant value at today’s price in addition to a 5%+ yield, so we think it deserves a buy recommendation. Newell’s selloff has put the company in rarified air in terms of its yield as it is now part of the desirable high-yield dividend stocks. However, Newell offers prospective shareholders much higher total returns than the hundreds of other stocks in this group thanks to its valuation and growth potential. Overview of Recent Events Newell was founded in 1903 when Edgar Newell purchased a struggling curtain rod manufacturer in rural New York. Since that time, Newell has undergone countless acquisitions and divestitures to become a consumer brands powerhouse with an $8 billion market capitalization and nearly $9 billion in annual revenue. The company’s strategy is contingent upon frequent acquisitions and divestitures, such as recent mergers with Jarden as well as Sistema. Newell reported Q3 earnings on 11/2/18 and shares flew higher off of the release. Year-over-year revenue was lower by 7.7%, although that was due to the company’s significant divestiture efforts. Gross margins fell fractionally but operating margin was up 10bps to 13% of revenue. The company saw strength in Latin America but that was offset by weakness in North America. Adjusted earnings-per-share came in at 81 cents versus 86 cents in the year-ago quarter. Newell is in the process of divesting non-core brands in a big way and using the proceeds to reduce leverage, as well as return capital to shareholders. Debt has come down by $2.5 billion year-over-year and management has reduced the float by 4% with use of cash from asset sales. Both of these are worthy developments for shareholders and we believe investors will continue to see meaningful capital returns in addition to reduced leverage.\\n Significant acquisitions and divestitures have occurred of late, which is providing Newell with huge amounts of cash, but is also reshaping its business for the future. Management outlined plans to divest $10 billion of assets, worth approximately one-third of total revenue, and it is well on its way. Indeed, the company has already divested Rawlings, Goody Products, Pure Fishing, and Jostens, to name a few. Newell has generated billions of dollars in proceeds from these deals and will continue to do so in the quarters to come until it reaches its goal. This cash will continue to be used to retire debt as well as buy back shares, both of which will help fuel earnings-per-share increases for years to come. \\n\\n Source: Q3 earnings supplement Management boosted guidance to a midpoint of $2.65 per share in earnings, an increase of 10 cents over previous guidance. When considering the enormous transformation the company is undergoing, a guidance boost was quite unexpected. However, the chosen strategy is clearly working, and management is very bullish. Growth Prospects Newell’s future growth is likely to be lumpy, but prospects are strong. The transformation is working well as results continue to be positive and management is quite bullish. Newell is positioning itself with its post-transformation assortment of brands for revenue and margin growth. While the company’s revenue base will be smaller thanks to asset sales, the share count and debt will also be much lower, affording the potential for strong operating leverage and earnings-per-share growth as revenue rises in the coming years. In total, we think Newell can achieve at least 5% annual earnings growth in the coming years. Management has also committed to 15% or higher operating margins after the business normalizes, up from 13% in the third quarter, for some context. That will take some time as the asset divestitures are still moving forward, but the upside is tremendous.\\n The selloff has made Newell a strong income stock as well as shares now yield in excess of 5%. We see continued upside for the dividend in the coming years as it is currently only one-third of earnings, meaning it is very safe and has room to grow. The dividend isn’t likely to be a priority for capital returns while the transformation is underway as management is going to focus on paying down debt and buying back shares. However, longer-term, Newell has the ability to pay more of its normalized earnings, so there is an element of dividend growth as well. Even without that potential, the current yield is extremely attractive. Total Return Potential Is In Excess Of 20% Annually Newell shares have been absolutely clobbered this year, pushing the valuation down to a price-to-earnings ratio of just 6.8 at the midpoint of the company’s guidance for this year, which was $2.65. That is a tremendously low price-to-earnings ratio by just about any standard and is less than half of what we see as fair value for Newell at 14 times earnings. While investors are trepidatious about the turnaround effort, the evidence suggests it is clearly working, so we are bullish on Newell’s potential to eventually return to a more normalized valuation. Multiple expansion should help produce roughly half of the stock’s projected 20%+ annual returns while the balance will come from ~5% annual earnings growth and the current 5%+ yield. Final Thoughts Newell offers investors the chance to gain potential upside from a turnaround story that is trading for what can only be considered a trough valuation. In addition, its current yield is more than 5% while capital returns and debt reduction are long-term upside catalysts for the stock as well. Newell’s transformation is a bit messy today but once the dust settles, we think the stock has enormous upside potential and thus, rate it a strong buy.\\nDisclosure: I am/we are long NWL.

Further, the index BCI retreats from its cyclical peak prior to a recession in a well-defined manner, allowing the extraction of the alternate indicator, BCIp (and its variant, BCIw), from which, on average, the 20-week leading recession signal is generated when BCIp falls below 25.\\n A more detailed explanation/description can be found here.

A lot of the discussion taking place about the “legacy” organizations, like GE or United Technologies, that are based upon “linear operations,” and the “new” concept of the corporation, that is based upon “platforms and networks.” Corporations are “linear” when there is a straight-line connection between the producing firm and the customer. Platforms and networks contain interactions between producers and customers, in many various ways. Conglomerates have been constructed around corporations that basically operated in a linear format and who were combined within a “portfolio” framework on the assumption that the management of the conglomerate could allocate resources, primarily financial resources, more efficiently than could the market. The “new” Modern Corporation is assembled from “intangibles,” primarily intellectual capital, that can be scaled at zero marginal cost of very modest marginal cost. As stated above, Mr. Breen has just spent the last three years merging DuPont Co. and Dow Chemical Co., building a larger conglomerate.\\n His next task, “taking the combination apart all over again.” Mr. Breen has the credentials for this kind of task because he performed similar feats over much of the last two decades. “As chief executive of General Instrument Corp., he engineered its sale to Motorola before joining Tyco International in 2002, where he stabilized the sprawling conglomerate after a corporate-fraud scandal. In 2007, he split Tyco into three companies, then five years later, divided the remaining Tyco into three entities again.” Consequently, he can reply to the question, “Are the days of conglomerates over?” with a very firm “I don’t think they’re over” because he has this background.  But, Mr. Breen continues, “it’s really a case-by-case basis.” He goes on, “When I did it at Tyco (breaking up a conglomerate) I thought it was the best way to create significant shareholder value above and beyond operating what it was.” However, “there are great conglomerates out there that have great business systems or something they’re really an expert at, and they know how to run it.” In other words, it depends. Some corporations are not ready to become “new” Modern Corporations, because their businesses are still “linear” in nature and are not built up from “intangibles” like intellectual capital. As a matter of fact, not all businesses will ever evolve into “new” Modern Corporations. This is where leadership becomes a crucial element of the equation. One cannot be totally rigid in addressing the conglomerate issue. One cannot just get “locked into” a formula. Historically, one can point to Jack Welch, who led General Electric during an amazing period of growth in 1981 through 2001, a period in which the company’s value rose by 4,000 percent. Yet, the model did not survive. Times changed. And, because the needed changes did not take place, General Electric fell from its pinnacle. Here we come back to Mr. Breen again. As stated above, Mr. Breen spent three years “merging industrial bastions” and now that that exercise has been completed, Mr. Breen will “take the combination apart again.”\\n When questioned by the Wall Street Journal about all his work in taking companies apart and putting companies together, one thing stands out in Mr. Breen’s responses. Mr. Breen constantly stresses openness and transparency. Openness and transparency with employees. Openness and transparency with activists investors. Openness and transparency with financial interests;. Openness and transparency in soliciting questions and concerns. Openness and transparency about what was being thought about and about the risks connected with options. Mr. Breen summarizes his efforts by saying, “In all the companies I’ve been in, having an open and honest assessment of risk has probably been one of the most valuable things I’ve ever done. Some of my biggest strategy moves came from understanding what the risk was in the company.” As we continue to evolve into this information age and the structural changes it brings, leaders need to accept the fact that many of the changes being driven in the economy come from how information is collected and used. This is especially true of intellectual capital. So far, Mr. Breen has set a good example for us. Others, like General Electric, have tried to hold onto a past image of what works and we have seen the result.\\nDisclosure: I/we have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

In fact, one could argue Apple has been emblematic of the market\\'s recent declines. The stock market essentially peaked the same day Apple reached its all-time high in early October, and it\\'s been downhill ever since. Since I put out my \"Apple: The Demise Of A Growth Era\" piece in early November, the stock had shed more than 30% of its value, falling all the way down to around $146. The precipitous declines have caused Apple\\'s stock to become substantially oversold, compressing the company\\'s valuation notably, and putting its shares in an attractive buy range. AAPL 1-Year \\n\\n Source: StockCharts.com Apple\\'s Valuation Perspective Apple\\'s growth is likely to be limited going forward, which essentially makes the company a value play now. Nevertheless, Apple is a great value stock, and is currently trading at a very cheap valuation relative to its worth and long-term potential.\\n This year (fiscal 2019), the company is expected to earn $13.29 per share, and next year (fiscal 2020), the company is projected to deliver $14.64 in EPS. This puts Apple\\'s valuation at just 11.66 times this year\\'s earnings and 10.5 times next year\\'s. This is quite cheap for a powerful, market-leading company that\\'s likely to continue increasing dividends and share buybacks. In fact, Apple\\'s dividend is now approaching 2%. Additionally, Apple could deliver higher EPS than analysts predict. Some estimates go as high as $18.50 for next year, which would put the company\\'s forward P/E at an astoundingly low 8.37 right now. Of course, the flip side is that Apple could deliver lower EPS than consensus estimates predict. However, even if a substantial market downturn materializes, Apple is unlikely to miss estimates by a lot, and even if the company reports at the bottom end of its range, $11, the stock is still trading at only 14 times forward earnings. The valuation perspective implies that Apple\\'s downside is likely very limited from here, unless the company begins to notably disappoint investors, which at this point seems unlikely. What Analysts Think In my \"Demise Of A Growth Era\" article, I suggested that Apple was overvalued relative to its near-term growth prospects, and the company\\'s shares were likely to pull back to around the $135-155 level, where they would represent a much better value opportunity long-term. With the market\\'s recent meltdown, Apple\\'s shares dropped to $146, bringing the price firmly within the price target range I proposed in my November article. I still believe this is a good level to either initiate a position or to add to an existing one at this point. Most Wall St. analysts have been a little behind the curve on Apple recently, and the 12-month price target range varies substantially amongst the numerous analysts covering the stock. Yet, even the lower end range of their estimates is higher than Apple\\'s current stock price. The 12-month price target range amongst analysts ranges from $165 to $280, with a consensus price target of $220. This puts the consensus price target amongst analysts at 42% above the stock\\'s current price. Moreover, the higher-end range price target is 80% higher than the current stock price.\\n This does not mean that analysts are necessarily right, or that the stock will go back above $200 anytime soon, but it does imply that shares may be undervalued here, and are likely a good, long-term investment at these levels. Technically Oversold Conditions AAPL 5-Year \\n\\n A brief technical view illustrates that the RSI recently hit around the 20 level, a point only touched upon several times in the company\\'s recent history, demonstrating extremely oversold technical conditions. Recent declines are also consistent with the company\\'s prior pullback of around 30% in 2015/2016. The technical image implies that Apple may be fit for a rally around current levels. Strong Long-Term Potential Apple is a powerhouse with substantial long-term potential. The company is getting set to deliver roughly $278 billion in revenues this year (fiscal 2019). This is about a 4.6% YoY increase, and the company is projected to expand revenues by an additional 4.1% next year (fiscal 2020) to roughly $290 billion. EPS is also expected to increase by a healthy margin, 11.76% this year (fiscal 2019), and 10% next year (fiscal 2020 - consensus estimates). The company is extremely efficient in creating profits for shareholders, and this phenomenon is not likely to change going forward. Therefore, despite the short-term market gyrations, Apple is still likely to steadily increase revenues and EPS over the long-term. Thus, the company\\'s stock price is likely to continue to appreciate in the years going forward. Problems to Be Aware of Despite the constructive, long-term outlook, investors should be aware of some potential issues for Apple in the intermediate term. The fact that the company will stop reporting detailed iPhone unit sales is troubling, because it suggests the company may be expecting stagnant or declining unit sales going forward.\\n There is also the possibility of longer upgrade cycles due to the incredibly high price of many iPhone devices, and their only incremental improvements. The average upgrade cycle may increase from 2-2.5 years to 3 years or possibly longer. This phenomenon may be the driving force behind stagnant or declining iPhone unit sales in the future. Another key factor to consider is that Apple\\'s shares may ultimately decline further in the current bear market cycle. If this indeed turns out to be a bear market, possibly a prolonged one, Apple\\'s shares could continue to slide due to overall pessimistic market dynamics, as well as a possible slowdown in sales due to a broad economic downturn. The Bottom Line Apple has declined by roughly 37% in the recent market downturn. The stock is now significantly oversold, and its P/E ratio has been reset to a much more attractive valuation. The stock has been brought down to an entry buy-in target range I suggested in early November, and likely represents a substantial long-term value opportunity at current levels. The company has enormous long-term value potential and is likely to continue to incrementally increase revenues and EPS over time. However, in the intermediate term, risks do exist, particularly a possible decline in iPhone unit sales, coupled with a broader economic slowdown, which could cause Apple\\'s stock to become even cheaper if the bear market in equities continues. I would be somewhat cautious here, but I would open an initial position, or add to an existing position here with a long-term outlook. At the same time, I would keep some dry powder on hand to possibly deploy at lower levels if the recent correction grows into a full-grown bear market, in which case Apple\\'s shares will almost certainly become even cheaper.

December saw vanadium China spot prices fall back to earth after their ~4 fold rise in 2018. Given the exponential rise in October this was not surprising. For some background you can read my earlier articles:  March 16, 2018 - A Look At The Vanadium Boom And Vanadium Miners  April 5, 2018 - Top 5 Vanadium Miners To Invest In The Vanadium Boom  October 29, 2018 - A Brief Update On The Vanadium Boom   Vanadium uses Vanadium is traditionally used to harden steel. However Vanadium Flow Batteries (VRFBs) are becoming increasingly popular, especially for commercial energy storage, most notably in China. Vanadium oxide spot price history China Vanadium Pentoxide [V2O5] Flake 98% Price - USD 20.90/lb  \\n\\n  Source: Vanadiumprice.com Vanadium demand versus supply  \\n\\n Source: Australian Vanadium presentation Vanadium demand forecast to outstrip supply 2018-2025 \\n\\n Source: Technology Metals Australia investor presentation & TTP Squared\\n Vanadium market news  In 2017 Robert Friedland stated: We think there’s a revolution coming in vanadium redox flow batteries,” he says. \"You’ll have to get into the mining business and produce ultra-pure vanadium electrolyte for those batteries on a massive scale. We’re very deeply interested in how you store electrical energy in the grid. The beauty of the vanadium redox battery is that you can charge and discharge it at the same time, something that can’t be done with a lithium battery. With a vanadium redox flow battery, you can put solar power and wind power into the battery, and you can put excess grid power into the battery at night, and at the same time you can have a stable output into the grid. A recent interview from The Assay from energy metals expert Chris Berry gives his views on vanadium: Of all of the battery metals, vanadium worries me the most. The current narrative of China requiring re-enforced rebar steel in construction, coupled with the advent of vanadium redox battery (VRB) deployment, is one that has been in play since 2012 when I first started studying the market. Will this time be different? The speculative end of the market sure seems to think so, having pushed vanadium pentoxide pricing sky high off its lows of $4/lb to over $30/lb at the time of this interview. Strangely, the reaction of the juniors vis-à-vis share price has been mixed with some winners and some that have been left behind. This is odd given the relatively reliable trend of junior share prices following the trajectory of underlying commodity price. You’re also starting to see uranium juniors include the word \"vanadium\" in their name and state their intentions to produce vanadium alongside uranium. Historically, this is the sign that a rally is overdone and due for a correction. Given that vanadium can account for 40% of the cost of a VRB, the current vanadium pricing environment renders a VRB arguably uncompetitive with lithium ion and other battery technologies. One area to watch here is new business models around VRBs. As the vanadium electrolyte doesn’t degrade, leasing it is an option which can help battery economics overall. I have no conviction on where I think vanadium prices will go, but given the narrative and basic battery economics, it would appear that steel demand is going to remain the real driver of vanadium demand for some time. My sense is that this ship has sailed.\\n On December 19 Investing news reported: Vanadium Outlook 2019: After the “Year of Vanadium,” What’s Next?.......While producers remain optimistic that the price growth will stay the course, Roskill gave a more subdued outlook. In fact, according to Bedder, price growth could negatively impact the VRFB sector. “Roskill’s baseline forecasts suggest that demand from this sector may plateau for some years until vanadium supply increases and prices retreat,” he said. While there are a number of vanadium projects at various levels of development around the world, meeting increased demand could prove harder than many anticipate. “The key question for the market is how will supply increase to meet demand,” added Bedder. “There is only so much more material that can come from co-production in China, especially during a period of environmental inspections and steel industry consolidations.” “We expect prices to remain high for some time — so it’s the perfect time to finance and develop a project,” he said.

However Vanadium Flow Batteries (VRFBs) are becoming increasingly popular, especially for commercial energy storage, most notably in China. Vanadium oxide spot price history China Vanadium Pentoxide [V2O5] Flake 98% Price - USD 20.90/lb  \\n\\n  Source: Vanadiumprice.com Vanadium demand versus supply  \\n\\n Source: Australian Vanadium presentation Vanadium demand forecast to outstrip supply 2018-2025 \\n\\n Source: Technology Metals Australia investor presentation & TTP Squared\\n Vanadium market news  In 2017 Robert Friedland stated: We think there’s a revolution coming in vanadium redox flow batteries,” he says. \"You’ll have to get into the mining business and produce ultra-pure vanadium electrolyte for those batteries on a massive scale. We’re very deeply interested in how you store electrical energy in the grid. The beauty of the vanadium redox battery is that you can charge and discharge it at the same time, something that can’t be done with a lithium battery. With a vanadium redox flow battery, you can put solar power and wind power into the battery, and you can put excess grid power into the battery at night, and at the same time you can have a stable output into the grid. A recent interview from The Assay from energy metals expert Chris Berry gives his views on vanadium: Of all of the battery metals, vanadium worries me the most. The current narrative of China requiring re-enforced rebar steel in construction, coupled with the advent of vanadium redox battery (VRB) deployment, is one that has been in play since 2012 when I first started studying the market. Will this time be different? The speculative end of the market sure seems to think so, having pushed vanadium pentoxide pricing sky high off its lows of $4/lb to over $30/lb at the time of this interview. Strangely, the reaction of the juniors vis-à-vis share price has been mixed with some winners and some that have been left behind. This is odd given the relatively reliable trend of junior share prices following the trajectory of underlying commodity price. You’re also starting to see uranium juniors include the word \"vanadium\" in their name and state their intentions to produce vanadium alongside uranium. Historically, this is the sign that a rally is overdone and due for a correction. Given that vanadium can account for 40% of the cost of a VRB, the current vanadium pricing environment renders a VRB arguably uncompetitive with lithium ion and other battery technologies. One area to watch here is new business models around VRBs. As the vanadium electrolyte doesn’t degrade, leasing it is an option which can help battery economics overall. I have no conviction on where I think vanadium prices will go, but given the narrative and basic battery economics, it would appear that steel demand is going to remain the real driver of vanadium demand for some time. My sense is that this ship has sailed.\\n On December 19 Investing news reported: Vanadium Outlook 2019: After the “Year of Vanadium,” What’s Next?.......While producers remain optimistic that the price growth will stay the course, Roskill gave a more subdued outlook. In fact, according to Bedder, price growth could negatively impact the VRFB sector. “Roskill’s baseline forecasts suggest that demand from this sector may plateau for some years until vanadium supply increases and prices retreat,” he said. While there are a number of vanadium projects at various levels of development around the world, meeting increased demand could prove harder than many anticipate. “The key question for the market is how will supply increase to meet demand,” added Bedder. “There is only so much more material that can come from co-production in China, especially during a period of environmental inspections and steel industry consolidations.” “We expect prices to remain high for some time — so it’s the perfect time to finance and develop a project,” he said.

(OTCQX:WSTRF) Western Uranium & Vanadium Corp. owns the Sunday Mine Complex which is an advanced stage mine property consisting of five interconnected underground mines in Colorado, USA. On November 28 Western Uranium & Vanadium Corp. announced: Western Uranium & Vanadium provides Sunday mine complex re-opening update. Western is commencing this program with the goals of further defining its large vanadium resource and monetizing that resource. Western is in discussions with a number of large offshore companies that have the existing facilities to recover the vanadium contained in the SMC ore. The worldwide shortage of vanadium is impacting many companies around the world and thus making offtake agreements available for ore production. Initially ore will be shipped to existing offshore processing facilities with a longer term plan to build facilities in the United States. Once the SMC is opened, ore samples will be sent to the various interested parties for testing in their facilities. After testing, Western will negotiate offtake agreements to base load commercial production from the SMC. Investors can read the latest company presentation here.

Vanadium producers such as Largo Resources have been busy paying down debt, while the juniors continue to make excellent progress. Highlights for the month include:  China vanadium spot prices fell in December from US$32.10/lb to US$20.90/lb, after rising four-fold in 2018. The fall was to be expected. Chris Berry stated (at V2O5 US$30/lb) - \"Of all of the battery metals, vanadium worries me the most\" and \"given that vanadium can account for 40% of the cost of a VRB, the current vanadium pricing environment renders a VRB arguably uncompetitive with lithium ion and other battery technologies.\" Investing News - Re: Demand for vanadium for VRFBs - \"Roskill’s baseline forecasts suggest that demand from this sector may plateau for some years until vanadium supply increases and prices retreat.\" Bushveld Minerals poised to enter the Vanadium Battery market (in early 2019).  Largo Resources reduces debt by US$16.2m and again by US$US$26, and extends vanadium zone by 130% to 1.84 km in strike length.   Neometals agrees the sale of Mt Marion lithium mine equity for $A104 million and retains offtake rights....Balance sheet strengthened to support project development financing and offtake processes. Australian Vanadium releases a strong PFS - Post-tax NPV8% of US616m (assumes V2O5 price of US$13/lb), CapEx US$354m, C1 cash costs estimate of US$4.15/lb V2O5. Technology Metals Australia - In excess of 99.7% V2O5 achieved, confirmation of suitability of premium product for specialty vanadium markets.

The company's units suffered significantly in the recent sell-off, and restructuring fears resurfaced. Previously, the market was not that worried about debt negotiations that were likely to be held somewhere in late 2019/first half of 2020, but the oil price plunge led to risk reassessment. In this article, I will discuss the company's current position and my expectations for 2019. Company's current position As of now, Seadrill Partners has four semi-subs, four drillships and three tender rigs. Importantly, Seadrill (SDRL) has ownership interests in the majority of Seadrill Partners' rigs, as seen below: \\n\\n Source: 20-F 2017 At the end of the third quarter, Seadrill Partners had $882 million of cash, $163 million of current debt, and $2.9 billion of long-term debt. Seadrill Partners' major indebtedness, the Term Loan B, matures in February 2021. By that time, the company has to find a solution as it will not be able to pay this maturity in full. Meanwhile, the significant amount of cash on the balance sheet allows Seadrill Partners to pay a distribution which, given the units' highly depressed price levels, provides a roughly 25% yield (a signal that the market does not believe in its viability).\\n Expectations The company's semi-subs West Sirius and West Leo are cold stacked and currently are the main problem on the fleet front together with the warm stacked drillship West Polaris. In my opinion, chances of West Sirius and West Leo to come back to work in 2019 are close to zero. The reasons for this are the challenging situation in the benign environment semi-sub segment, the recent oil price plunge and the fact that there are many hot rigs that stand in front of West Sirius in the queue, waiting for jobs. In my opinion, the company will concentrate on putting West Polaris at work. This is not a top rig, and if Seadrill Partners wants to save it as part of the fleet, it should avoid cold stacking it at all costs. I do not expect Seadrill Partners to immediately start negotiations with creditors. The Term Loan B is due at the beginning of 2021; there are still two years to go. The leverage covenant was replaced by minimum liquidity covenant, and Seadrill Partners is easily within these new limits (6-K, page 127). There is no need to rush, in my opinion. As for the distribution, it may indeed get slashed, but only as a symbolic move because the amount of money that goes to it is negligible compared to both the company's cash cushion and debt. \\n\\n In my opinion, Seadrill Partners will require more upside in oil prices than other drillers to rebound from current levels. The market is worried that negotiations with creditors won't end well for common unitholders. From a practical point of view, I'd wait for other drillers' stocks to show upside in the short-term and only then try to play rebound in Seadrill Partners. Speaking about longer-term perspectives, Seadrill Partners now carries significant risk because the oil price plunge damaged confidence in offshore drilling, and it will take time to gain it back - and timing is important for the company. Any long-term bet should acknowledge the risk of losing principal and be sized accordingly. It's not yet time for a full-blown panic since the company has two more years and has a significant cash cushion, but it's also not a bet that suits everyone.\\n That said, I wish you all a happy and prosperous New Year, whether you are long, short or on the sidelines!

The discount is huge 42% if we adjust for the special dividend.New BDC leverage rules should enable KCAP to improve dividend coverage.'], 'article': ['KCAP Financial (NASDAQ:KCAP) had wonderful news on 12/18/2018, but the timing was awful. Shareholders are expected to receive a 67 cent per share special dividend as BC Partners acquires the management rights. BC Partners has $24 billion in assets under management and an excellent track record. Despite this great news, KCAP stock has barely moved higher and continues to trade at a huge discount to net asset value. The problem appears to be poor timing. The financial markets, including the BDC sector have been in a nasty selloff. The positive developments at KCAP have gotten lost amidst this turmoil. This article highlights 8 reasons for income investors to consider KCAP and also covers the major risks. 1. The special dividend As noted in the 12/17/2018 press release, KCAP shareholders can expect a hefty 67 cent per share special dividend as KCAP converts from internal management to external management by BC Partners: \"Under the terms of the agreement, if the new advisory agreement is approved by stockholders and the other conditions to closing are satisfied, stockholders will receive a direct cash payment from an affiliate of BC Partners of $25 million, or approximately $0.67 per share.\" This special dividend is especially significant as it\\'s being paid out of new money and will not reduce the $4.66 per share net asset value. Internal management is often viewed as an advantage in the Business Development Corporation sector. However, this has not been the case for KCAP. KCAP has a history of dividend cuts and trades at a large discount to NAV. Replacing sub-par internal management with first rate external management is a positive. The transaction is expected to close in Q1 2019, so the special dividend is likely to be paid in March or April.\\n 2. BC Partners is large and well established BC Partners is a global asset manager with over $24 billion in managed assets that is headquartered in London with several other global offices including New York City. They have been operating for over 30 years and are ranked among the top private equity firms located in London. Some of their major portfolio companies are listed here. 3. BC Partners needs to grow KCAP Why is a large asset manager like BC Partners willing to pay such a premium price to manage a small BDC like KCAP with a history of under-performance? Note that the $25 million payment by BC partners represents a generous 21% of NAV. New BDC rules go into effect shortly in March 2019. Severe restrictions on BDC balance leverage have been relaxed. BDCs will be allowed to increase their debt-to-equity ratio from 1:1 to 2:1. External management fees will rise as leverage is used to double gross managed assets. BC Partners needs to grow KCAP in order to justify the premium price they are paying to establish themselves in the BDC management business. BDCs normally grow by selling additional shares. However, KCAP is in no position to sell shares while trading at a huge discount to NAV. In order to grow KCAP, BC Partners must believe that they can deliver improved results such that KCAP no longer trades at a discount. 4. The new BDC rules should improve dividend coverage If used prudently, higher balance leverage can improve dividend coverage. The 1:1 debt-to-equity limit made it hard to cover the large dividends demanded by BDC investors. Like many of its peers, KCAP used risky and volatile CLO investments to juice yields. Unfortunately, this often resulted in a loss of NAV. KCAP appears to be exiting the CLO business with the 11/9/2018 sale of its asset management subsidiaries for $37.9 million. More traditional lending can be done with the relaxed balance sheet rules. Net investment income and dividend coverage should increase as the portfolio of client loans is expanded.\\n 5. KCAP trades at a discount to peers According to the Closed-End Fund Advisors BDC Universe database, the average credit focused BDC trades at a 23% discount to NAV. The 28% discount for KCAP is significantly larger than the average discount. The current $3.37 share price of KCAP can be adjusted to $2.70 to account for the pending 67 cent per share special dividend. Therefore, on an adjusted basis, KCAP is trading at a 42% discount to the $4.66 NAV. The adjusted 42% discount to NAV gives KCAP a higher discount than all but 7 of the 48 BDC issues in the BDC Universe database, 6. Credit quality is good 96% of KCAP\\'s debt portfolio was comprised of secured loans as of 9/30/2018. KCAP has only moderate exposure to the volatile energy sector, which represents 8% of assets. Out of 47 investments, only 1 is currently on non-accrual status. 3 PIK (payment in kind) investments are also on partial non-accrual status. Based on the above, KCAP should require only a moderate amount of balance sheet cleanup work from BP Partners. This is always an important consideration when a new asset manager takes charge. New management has a tendency to write off problems left behind by prior management. 7. BC Partners has an incentive not to reduce the dividend BC Partners has agreed to waive its management fee for 1 year if it is unable to cover the 10 cent per share quarterly dividend. BC Partners appears to be betting that it can use increased balance sheet leverage (see item #4) to fully cover the dividend. As stated in the 12/18/2018 press release: \"BC Partners has agreed to contribute up to 100% of incentive fees earned, if necessary, to achieve net investment income of $0.40 per share for a one-year period after closing\" 8. BC Partners will purchase shares at 100% of NAV As stated in the 12/18/2018 press release, BC Partners has committed to purchase shares at 100% of NAV. This will benefit other shareholders since KCAP is now trading at a large discount to NAV: \"...and to use up to $10 million of the incentive fees it earns to purchase newly-issued KCAP common stock over the next two years at a price equal to net asset value per share at the time of the purchases.\"\\n What are the major risks? See page #67 of the 10K annual report for a full discussion of risks. My brief discussion of the major risks follows here. Like other BDCs, KCAP is focused on making loans to middle market companies. If there is a severe economic downturn, some of these smaller companies may be more susceptible to problems than their larger peers. The deal with BC Partners is expected to close in Q1 2019, but there is always some risk that an unexpected problem will prevent the deal from closing. More balance sheet leverage could increase risk if not utilized carefully. Note that even with the relaxed balance sheet restrictions, KCAP will still be far less leveraged than a typical bank. Conclusions There are a lot of good reasons to consider KCAP. Investors can look forward to a special dividend, improved management, and improving dividend coverage. Despite these positives, KCAP remains among the most deeply discounted of the public BDC issues.\\nAuthor\\'s note: My Panick Value Research Report is focused on high-yield preferred stocks, exchange-traded debt issues, and other undervalued, high-yield opportunities.

With all due respect to my fellows writing about Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL), and their mighty ilk, I find myself hard-pressed to believe I can out-analyze investment professionals with continuous access to cutting-edge financial software, company management, spreadsheet jockey minions, and a salary that allows them to devote 80+ hours a week to studying and publishing on a handful of names. As such, I seek out stocks with few or - better still - no coverage from Wall Street analysts. I\\'m still up against the buy-side funds with their own suite of products and analysts, but at least we\\'re researching in ostensibly virgin soil as opposed to names publicly strip-mined of information and insight!

For those of you unfamiliar with the Piotroski score, it originated in a 2002 paper by University of Chicago accounting professor Joseph Piotroski, and scores stocks from zero (the worst) to nine (the best) based on a variety of financial metrics. The distribution of scores across a broad index of stocks is pleasingly normal, such that anything scoring 7 or above seems worth further investigation.\\n As such, this will be part of an ongoing series in which I take uncovered stocks with strong (i.e. 7 or above) Piotroski scores to see if we can find any value in these unloved but perhaps quite rewarding names. First up: National HealthCare Corporation (NHC). National HealthCare - Seniormost Among Senior Care NHC is the oldest publicly-traded senior health care company in the United States. Founded in 1971 and headquartered in Murfreesboro, Tennessee, it operates in 10 states but concentrates mostly in Tennessee, Missouri, South Carolina, and Florida. The company operates (per its Q3 2018 10-Q) 76 skilled nursing facilities, 24 assisted living facilities, and 5 independent living facilities, as well as 35 homecare programs. These numbers have remained mostly constant over the past decade or so, with the exception of recent growth in the number of assisted living facilities:          Q3 \\'18 2017 2016 2015 2014 2013 2012 2011 2010 2009   Skilled nursing facilities 76 76 74 74 74 69 75 75 77 76   Assisted living 24 24 21 20 18 15 17 17 16 23   Independent living 5 5 5 5 5 5 6 6 7 7   Homecare programs 35 36 36 36 36 38 37 36 36 33  Source: Company Form 10-Ks for annual data, 10-Q for Q3 2018.  The demographic trend that feeds into NHC\\'s business are well-known - projections show the aging of the population that we face in coming decades as baby boomers transition to retirement: \\n\\n \\n\\n A demographic wave indeed, the percentage of the population above 65 moves from 15.5% to 20.9% over the next 15 years - an increase of 24.5 million people.\\n NHC\\'s facilities are well-placed to benefit from this broad trend, particularly as the states in which they operate require Certificates of Need (legal permission that must be obtained before new construction) for the skilled nursing facilities that are the core of the company\\'s business. Certificates of Need are not, however, required to build assisted or independent living facilities, so this barrier to entry is somewhat limited. Indeed, the company cites overbuilding in some markets as a risk to their operations, and ensuring their beds stay filled is a critical task. Over the past decade, occupancy in its skilled nursing facilities (which the company refers to as \"census\") has hovered around 90%:         Q3 \\'18 2017 2016 2015 2014 2013 2012 2011 2010 2009   Licensed beds 9,604 9,579 9,398 9,403 9,462 8,943 9,460 9,456 9,742 9,772   Census 89.7% 90.2% 89.5% 90.0% 88.9% 89.2% 90.1% 90.6% 92.0% 92.0%  Source: Company Form 10-Ks for annual data, 10-Q for Q3 2018.  Furthermore, in 2015 the company began to disclose the ratings of its skilled nursing facilities according to the Center for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) Five-Star Quality Rating System. 4- and 5-star ratings are particularly desirable, and the company has made strides in increasing the number of facilities rated as such. While there has not been a noticeable change in occupancy over this time, hopefully, continued progress could prove a lure to new residents, or at least reduce a headwind to occupancy going forward.

I\\'m From the Government and I\\'m Here to Reimburse You If the census levels of NHC\\'s facilities offer insight into how the company could grow the volume of their business (that is, fill more beds) then the complementary idea is that of pricing power: how much can NHC charge for its services? To understand that, we need to focus on the core of the company\\'s business, its patient revenues.\\n NHC\\'s operating revenue derives mostly (95.3% as of Q3 2018) from its inpatient services - skilled nursing, assisted and independent living, and homecare. The balance comes from renting properties it owns, managing other health care facilities, and related insurance services, but this analysis ignores those items as they account for less than 5% of revenue and have been losing share to patient revenues over the past several years:         Q3 \\'18 2017 2016 2015 2014 2013 2012 2011 2010   Net patient revenues $ 697,173 $ 919,843 $ 880,724 $ 864,846 $ 829,287 $ 735,837 $ 705,386 $ 715,489 $ 663,629   Other revenues $ 34,256 $ 47,153 $ 45,914 $ 41,776 $ 42,396 $ 53,120 $ 55,876 $ 58,048 $ 57,024   Total operating revenues $ 731,429 $ 966,996 $ 926,638 $ 906,622 $ 871,683 $ 788,957 $ 761,262 $ 773,537 $ 720,653                         Net patient revenues (%) 95.3% 95.1% 95.0% 95.4% 95.1% 93.3% 92.7% 92.5% 92.7%   Other revenues (%) 4.7% 4.9% 5.0% 4.6% 4.9% 6.7% 7.3% 7.5% 7.3%  Source: Company Form 10-Ks for annual data, 10-Q for Q3 2018.  NHC\\'s patient services - be they caring for the elderly, rehabilitation services, hospice, or other items - can be paid for out of the public purse (i.e. Medicare and Medicaid) or privately (by the patient or by managed care organizations like PPO, HMO, and POS plans). In the years since the Affordable Care Act (ACA), the company has maintained a diverse payor mix, but while private sources have grown public payors still dominate:       Revenues by Payor Q3 \\'18 2017 2016 2015 2014 2013 2012 2011 2010   Public 61% 61% 63% 65% 65% 65% 67% 70% 69%   Medicare 35% 35% 37% 40% 39% 40% 42% 44% 42%   Medicaid 26% 26% 26% 25% 26% 25% 25% 26% 27%   Private Pay + Managed Care 39% 39% 37% 35% 35% 35% 33% 30% 31%   Private Pay 27% 26% 25% 24% 24% 25%     30%   Managed Care 12% 13% 12% 11% 11% 10%     1%  Source: Company Form 10-Ks for annual data, 10-Q for Q3 2018, and own calculations. Changing disclosures by NHC cause gaps in data.  CEO Stephen Flatt, who took the helm in 2017, has emphasized that part of his strategy is to move towards private payors and away from the government given the price-setting power of the Center for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) and state Medicaid programs. As Flatt remarked in a 2017 interview with the Nashville Post:\\n The ACA and value-based payment methodologies blurred the lines between what we\\'ve traditionally known as acute care and post-acute care. We used to give care and get paid only for the silo of care we provided in that particular setting. All providers now share joint responsibility for a patient\\'s experience and outcomes across the entire care continuum. That whole paradigm does require a different perspective and strategy. More to the point, this new paradigm brings with it new methodologies to determine how NHC is reimbursed for the care it provides. To get an idea of how complex this can be, an excerpt from the company\\'s most recent 10-Q (page 23): Starting on October 1, 2019, CMS plans to start using a new case-mix model, called the Patient-Driven Payment Model (PDPM), which focuses on a resident\\'s condition and care needs, rather than the amount of care provided, to determine reimbursement levels. The PDPM replaces the existing case-mix classification methodology, the Resource Utilization Groups, Version IV (RUG-IV) model, used to categorize Part A residents into various payment groups based on their level of need. The new PDPM is expected to better account for patient characteristics by relating payment to patients\\' conditions and clinical needs rather than on volume-based services. The PDPM is also expected to reduce systemic complexity and save skilled nursing facilities approximately $2.0 billion over 10 years in administrative costs. Under the new rule, CMS is finalizing changes to the Skilled Nursing Facilities Value-based Purchasing Program. The transition from RUG-IV to PDPM is no doubt worth an article in and of itself, but the main takeaway is unchanged - pricing power remains in the hands of the government, not the company. Given that Medicare is 35% of revenue, that\\'s a critical - and difficult to estimate - driver of the company\\'s sales growth! Difficult to estimate, but not impossible, as CMS offers annual guidance on its expected increase in reimbursement for the coming year, which NHC discloses in its 10-Ks under a section titled \"Medicare Legislation and Regulations\". Since 2010, this number has generally been between 1.0-2.5%, which at least offers us some insight as to how NHC\\'s ability to increase revenue in the Medicare portion of its payor mix.\\n As for Medicaid, the states in which NHC operates are for the most part deeply Republican and state governments in Tennessee, Missouri, South Carolina, and Florida have not yet opted into the Medicaid expansion. While the company offers guidance on how annual state Medicaid budgets will impact its revenues (found in filings under the heading \"Medicaid Legislation and Regulations\") it warns that \"states will continue to control Medicaid expenditures and also look for adequate funding sources... potentially having an impact on funding for skilled nursing facilities.\" (pg. 33 of the 2017 10-K) This risk offers both a downside and an upside to NHC - if states cannot find room in their budgets for the care the company offers, it may be squeezed. On the other hand, if these states adopt the federal expansion of Medicaid as part of the ACA (as a number of other Republican-governed states have done) it is also possible that increased funding could flow through to NHC or reduce the amount of uncompensated care it sees, as some studies have suggested Medicaid expansion does. Keeping all this in mind, NHC discloses the actual growth in per diem rates it experiences, and the divide between growth in public and private rates is clear:       Per diem rate growth Q3 \\'18 2017 2016 2015 2014 2013 2012 2011 2010 2009   Medicare 0.7% 1.8% 2.9% 0.9% 1.5% -0.2% -4.9% 13.5% 4.8% 3.8%   Medicaid 1.7% 2.0% 1.8% 1.6% 2.4% 3.5% 1.4% 0.5% 3.0% 3.0%   Private payor 4.3% 3.2% 3.2% 2.7% 3.5% 6.3% 3.5% 0.7% 4.2% 4.8%   Managed care -0.6% 0.2% 0.5% 1.1% -1.9% -0.5% -1.6%        Source: Company Form 10-Ks for annual data, 10-Q for Q3 2018. Data for managed care unavailable before 2012.  Put differently, if we assumed a $100 per diem in 2008, by the end of 2018 (if we assume Q3 rates carry forward to year end) the Medicare per diem has grown to $126.59, Medicaid to $122.94, and private payor to $142.85. The CEO\\'s plan to shift the payor mix to private sources is an appealing course of action given stronger pricing power here, and while change has been slow, continued progress should be welcomed by investors. The execution of this public-to-private pivot is a critical point of execution and should be monitored closely.\\n Don\\'t Forget! Income Statement, Balance Sheet, Cash Flow Thematically, we see where the company is and where it might be going, but of course, that\\'s all just a story without some three statement analysis. Key line items from the income statement are summarized in the table below. Operating revenues are approaching a $1 billion annual run rate, but are growing in low single digits given aforementioned constraints of public per diem amounts and census levels, as well as the lack of expansion of physical plant. (The revenue gyrations from 2012-2014 are due to contracting reimbursement rates in 2012, the offloading of a Kansas-based portfolio of facilities in 2013, and bringing replacements online in Tennessee and Missouri in 2014.) Gross margins are mid-single digits, although they have come down several points in the years post-ACA. Earnings have been growing, and dividend payout ratio is sustainable at ~50%. Nonoperating income throws a bit of a wrench in the works for the earnings numbers given a non-consolidated hospice business NHC owns a significant percentage of, the earnings of which have stabilized since 2013, but in my opinion, these are not a key part of the overall story.

Q3 2018 data is for last 12 months. Data in $ millions, except for per share and ratios.  Getting more granular, the table above illustrates recent development around NHC preferred shares. Issued in 2007 as part of a merger, all outstanding preferred shares were purchased in 2015 (also visible in how the $8.7 million \\'Preferred Dividends\\' line item drops to zero thereafter). The shares were bought for $170 million, funded mostly by assuming $110 million of long-term debt - we can the corresponding spike in interest expense in recent years. The company has since paid down that debt to $75 million. The ongoing reduction of debt is likely to continue, as the credit facility expires in 2020, and the loan is floating rate debt. With no preferred dividends to pay out and a (hopefully) diminishing interest expense burden, the NHC dividend looks secure and indeed has room to grow. If the payout ratio were to bump to the conventionally safe 60% at today\\'s prices, that would boost the dividend yield to around 3.9%. Then again, could NHC pursue growth rather than returning cash to shareholders? With over $195 million of unrestricted cash and equity securities on hand, it certainly seems like the company could grow through acquisition. Certificate of Need states where NHC already has a foothold include Georgia, Alabama, and Kentucky, and given that its presence in all those states dates to the 1970s, it certainly has experience in geographies beyond its core markets. I can\\'t find any comments from management on the potential for growth of this kind, but I wonder if it might be an opportunity several years down the road, once long-term debt has been paid off and the slow transition to private payors plays out. The Adams Family and National Health Investors Speaking of management, the current CEO, Stephen Flatt, has been with the company since 2005 but as previously mentioned only stepped into his current role in January 2017 after the retirement of then-CEO and current board chairman Robert Adams. Robert\\'s brother, Andrew Adams was CEO from 1981 through 2004, when Robert took over. Before Andrew, their father Dr. Carl Adams was the CEO - he founded the company in 1971.\\n That\\'s 45 years of Adams family rule at NHC! If nothing else, I look forward to the Flatt regime merely for the change of pace. Collectively, Robert Adams, Andrew Adams, and Dorothy Adams (ex-wife of Andrew) own 10% of the company, substantially more than any other insider by a substantial margin:        Holder Role Value ($m) % Out   Adams, W Andrew Director, Former CEO 53.3 4.4   Adams, Robert G Non-Executive Chairman, Former CEO 33.6 2.8   Adams, Dorothy B Ex-wife of W. Andrew Adams 33.4 2.8   Laroche, Richard F Jr Director, Former General Counsel 28 2.3   Tucker, Lawrence Cole Director 12.3 1   Ussery, Robert Michael President & Chief Operating Officer 10.9 0.9   Powell, Julia W Chief Nursing Officer 9 0.7  Source: FactSet, as of 12/14/18.  There has not been any major selling activity that might worry a potential investor, but there is certainly an additional point of complexity that the founding family brings to the table. The Adams family are also the founders of National Health Investors (NHI). NHI was created as a REIT in 1991 with a plan to operate it in tandem with National HealthCare. According to the Q3 2018 10-Q (page 17, Note 7 - Long-Term Leases) NHC currently leases 35 of its skilled nursing facilities, 7 assisted living homes, and 3 independent living homes from NHI, for a cost of over $28 million in the first three quarters of 2018. The companies \"decoupled\" (consciously, I presume?) over a decade ago but it is difficult to tell if NHC is getting a fair deal given Andrew Adams remains as chairman of the board at NHI while his brother Robert is chairman at NHC. The current leasing agreement between NHC and NHI dates to 2007 but will last until 2026 under current terms, with 2 five-year extension options according to the 2017 10-K (page 67, Note 6: Long-Term Leases). The agreement set a base rent level, but also requires NHC pay NHI 4% of net facility revenue increases. I\\'m not sufficiently familiar with the dynamics of the market to know how standard that term is, nor it is a figure that will significantly affect earnings, but the connection between these companies is at least something to be mindful of. Of course, it\\'s equally possible NHC could be getting a better deal than it otherwise might - perhaps these leases are something for NHI investors to be concerned about! In fact, the performance of NHI is of some interest to a National HealthCare investor. Remember the $195 million of unrestricted cash and equity securities on NHC\\'s balance sheet? NHI makes up $123 million of that portfolio or 88% of their total equities. One way or another, the Adams\\' family businesses remain linked.\\n A more directly concerning note on management: the company\\'s most recent 8-K noted that general counsel John Lines resigned suddenly on 11/15/18, and the company has not offered any explanation as to why. Press clippings indicate that Lines was intimately involved in the business, and while his abrupt resignation may be due to circumstances unrelated to NHC, the sudden departure of the company\\'s chief lawyer is concerning. Certainly, something to be mindful of as investors await the 2018 10-K. Competitors & Valuation As mentioned above, NHC is very much in a competitive market for many of its services - assisted and independent living homes, homecare services, rehabilitation, hospice, all of these are markets where the company competes with other providers. While the company is pursuing alliances with major medical centers in its primary geographies, senior care is a well-developed market with a number of large players, quite a few of which are larger than NHC. A few specific competitors against which to compare National HealthCare; Amedisys, an in-home healthcare provider; LHC Group, a post-acute care specialist focused on Medicare beneficiaries; Ensign Group, a diversified provider like NHC; Brookdale Senior Living, the largest operator of senior living and retirement communities; and Genesis Healthcare, an operator of skilled nursing facilities. On a variety of metrics, NHC looks cheap:         Company Name Price Market Value ($m) Enterprise Value ($m) EV/EBITDA Sales ($m) Net Income ($m) EPS P/E (LTM) P/FCF (LTM) P/B (LTM) Dividend Yield   National Healthcare $79.70 1,214.10 1,091.40 10.66x 977.7 62.3 4.09 19.49x 17.40x 1.69x 3.10%                             Amedisys $124.24 3,961.90 4,005.30 24.28x 1,632.40 88 2.59 47.97x 22.03x 8.92x 0.00%   LHC Group $99.24 3,113.60 3,429.60 25.70x 1,592.50 61.5 2.63 37.73x 86.06x 3.11x 0.00%   Ensign Group $42.82 2,240.30 2,451.10 14.79x 1,990.60 77.2 1.43 29.94x 20.90x 3.98x 0.80%   Brookdale Senior Living $7.87 1,477.50 5,934.60 10.40x 4,628.40 -644.7 -3.44 -- 37.68x 1.71x 0.00%   Genesis Healthcare $1.56 253.6 4,339.50 10.10x 5,118.60 -255.6 -2.57 -- 15.67x -- 0.00%                             Average 55.15 2,209.40 4,032.00 17.05x 2,992.50 -134.7 0.13 38.55x 36.47x 4.43x 0.20%   Median 42.82 2,240.30 4,005.30 14.79x 1,990.60 61.5 1.43 37.73x 22.03x 3.55x 0.00%  Source: FactSet. As of 12/14/18.  Of course, just because something is cheap does not mean it cannot stay that way or get cheaper, which is another reason I like the dividend on NHC, especially compared to its dividend-less competition. Perhaps now that the Adams are aging (Robert and Andrew are in their early 70s) they might appreciate more cash flow from their NHC holdings rather than having to sell shares of the family golden goose! In Conclusion NHC offers exposure to a demographic mega-trend, has a solid if unexceptional financial foundation and its dividend is sufficiently secure to offer upside in coming years. On the other hand, health care regulations are complex and still in midst of change, constraining revenue growth and offering little in the way of long-term guidance. The multi-decade tenure of the founding family has only recently come to an end, and the CEO is still fresh to running a billion-dollar company. Taking all these together, have we struck gold with our first uncovered value name? I\\'m interested in your comments, but if nothing else I certainly don\\'t think we are trying to transmute lead - NHC might be in the midst of a period of transition, but the stock is worth watching. I\\'m going to wait for the 2018 10-K in February to refresh my analysis, but in general, I think National HealthCare could offer a compelling place to let your money grow old in comfort.\\nDisclosure: I/we have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

STZ’s stock price could come under even more downward pressure when it reports its Q3 results in a few weeks. STZ is likely to report a significant loss for its Q3 ended November 30, 2018 primarily because of the decline in the market price of Canopy Growth (CGC) stock. History of Constellation Brands Investment in Canopy Growth Constellation Brands (STZ) made an initial $191.3 million investment in Canopy Growth Corporation (CGC) in November 2017 by purchasing 18,876,901 shares at $12.9783 per share. At that time it also received options to acquire an additional 18,876,901 shares at the same price exercisable in two equal tranches on August 1, 2018 and August 1, 2019. On June 20, 2018 STZ injected additional funds into CGC by purchasing $200 million of the $600 million in 4.25% Convertible Senior Notes due 2023 that were issued by Canopy. These notes can be converted into CGC common stock at the ratio of 23.7431 shares per $1,000 in par value. On November 1, 2018 STZ acquired an additional 104,500,000 newly issued common shares of CGC plus warrants to purchase 139,745,453 common shares for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $4 billion or $38.40 per common share. The warrants are divided into 88,472,861 Tranche A Warrants that are immediately exercisable at a price of $39.70 and 51,272,592 Tranche B Warrants that are exercisable at a price equal to its 5 day volume weighted average price (VWAP) immediately prior to exercise. The Tranche B warrants can only be converted into common shares after all the Tranche A Warrants have been exercised. All these CGC Warrants expire on November 1, 2021. If Constellation exercised all its options and warrants it would own more than 50% of Canopy Growth.\\n The $4 billion investment by Constellation is viewed by some as an “all-in bet,” since on August 31, 2018 STZ was showing only $206 million in cash and equivalents on its balance sheet. It financed this purchase entirely with borrowed money as follows: (1) $350 million Commercial Paper, (2) $500 million 3-year term loan, (3) $1 billion 5-year term loan, (4) $650 million Senior Floating Rate Notes at 3 month LIBOR + 70 basis points due November 15, 2021, (5) $500 million 4.4% Senior Notes due November 15, 2025, (6) $500 million 4.65% Senior Notes due November 15, 2028, (7) $500 million 5.25% Senior Notes due November 15, 2048. These borrowings caused Constellation’s debt to equity ratio to rise from 86% to 120%. The current weighted average rate of this $4 billion is about 4.8% which equates to annual interest payments of $192 million or $16 million per month. Accounting Considerations Per FASB rules, STZ accounts for its investments in CGC on its income statement by recognizing any increase in market value of CGC as “income from unconsolidated investments.” STZ arrives at market value by multiplying the closing price of CGC stock by the number of shares it owns and adding to that the theoretical, intrinsic value of its options and warrants calculated by applying the Black-Scholes Model. Changes in the recognized value of CGC, net of taxes, flow through to STZ’s equity. From the date of its original investment through August 31, 2018, STZ recognized $1.361 billion in unrealized income from its investments in CGC by recognizing $464.3 million in income for its 2018 fiscal year ended February 28, 2018 and an additional $896.9 million for the six months ended August 31, 2018. This significant unrealized income occurred because the price of CGC rose above STZ’s cost basis and/or above the value recorded in the prior quarter. On February 28, 2018 CGC closed at $21.32 and on August 31, 2018 it closed at $45.72. The latter price was above the prices STZ paid for any of its CGC common shares and the options and warrants exercise prices.\\n Given the above information, STZ is about to report sharply negative results for its fiscal 2019 Q3 ended November 30, 2018. The market value of its 18,876,901 CGC shares will decline by $12.17/share ($45.72-$33.55) or $229,731,885, while the market value of its 104,500,000 shares will decline by $4.73/share ($38.28-$33.55) or $494,285,000. These two investments alone should therefore show a combined “loss from unconsolidated investments” of $724,016,885. Application of the Black-Scholes Model will also cause significant losses on the outstanding options and warrants, because they will not be as potentially lucrative. Additionally, as previously stated, Constellation will incur a significant increase in interest expense of about $16 million. At best, Constellation will report that it broke even in Q3. It is more likely that they will report a loss of about $1 per diluted share on 190 million shares. The recent weakness in Constellation and Canopy stocks suggest that Q3 results may already be reflected in their stock prices. Going forward investors will need to be pay attention to STZ beer, wine and spirits business as well as Canopy Growth’s business since both can dramatically affect reported earnings. Constellation’s highly regarded management realized that earnings would become volatile as a result of the Canopy investment. In the 10-K for 2018 they downplayed the $464.3 million reported in “income from unconsolidated investments” and stated, ““We expect the fair value of these investments to continue to be volatile in future periods.” Investors should expect STZ management to focus their remarks on operating earnings as a truer measure of how well Constellation is performing. In effect, they will take a page out of Warren Buffett’s playbook, because he has faced the same problem for the past few years and has told people to ignore Berkshire’s gains and losses from unconsolidated investments. Constellation, however, does not have the diversified investment portfolio of Berkshire. Instead, it has leveraged its balance sheet and concentrated its investment to gain effective control of the leading company in an emerging sector that is viewed as a direct threat to its beer, wine and spirits business.\\n The wisdom of Constellation’s aggressive move into the cannabis sector will depend on Canopy Growth becoming a consistently profitable company with positive, free cash flow in the next 12 months. This will be a challenge, because for the 9 months ended September 30, 2018 Canopy reported a net loss of about $350 million and, coincidently, negative cash flow (excluding financing) of about $350 million.

What news has people up in arms recently? Anyone who has been watching the news, much less actually following the market, is well aware that the market has been dropping a lot in the last week or two. And by quite a bit. Talk of corrections has been replaced with talk of bear markets. Fear and panic is widespread. What is a dividend investor to do? \\n\\n The YChart® above shows (SPY) since September. The price performance has been poor. Since October it has been on a downward trend with some significant volatility. But since the December 13, it has been down quite dramatically. The Fed meeting just exacerbated the downward trend. \\n\\n The YChart® above shows how a couple of dividend paying ETFs, (SCHD) and (SPHD), that are more indicative of how a dividend investor’s portfolio would have done shows that it wasn’t pretty in that sector either. Especially the December decline. My own portfolio did better in October and November (latest article on it is here) and even hit an all-time high early in November and just before the start of December. While I, PendragonY, have hit my income goal for the year, my portfolio value is down from the $531K it started the year at, and is now only $491K at of 11AM on Wednesday.\\n No one likes to see their portfolio value drop. It can certainly make one anxious to see the total market value of one’s portfolio drop nearly every day for around 2 weeks. Even if you know, like we do, that this means there are likely to be stocks that one wants to buy that are now at a good value. But this is a conflict between reason and emotion. Logically stocks are getting to be a better value, but it still can be hard to ignore that uneasy feeling that you have lost something. We all know that selling low is a bad idea. But how do we resist the fear that what is low priced today might not be a price we would be happy to get in a few weeks? We all know that buying low is the best plan, but how do we pull the trigger when it seems that prices are lower every day? Why setting your hair on fire over this news is unwarranted? Well, first let’s see if we can figure out why prices are dropping. Or, rather, let’s eliminate any causes that might put dividends in general in jeopardy. We still need to look at each company we might want to own (or continue owning) to ensure its dividend is safe, but let’s look at some factors that have broad effect. After the Fed meeting last week, where the Fed again increased the over-night rate, I heard many comments asserting that this rate increase was not only unnecessary but also “crazy”. Our thinking before the meeting was that there was a good chance that recent data might have the Fed pause in increasing rates. At a minimum we expected a far more dovish statement than was actually produced. But were the actions of the Fed completely unreasonable? Let’s look at some of the data. One of the Fed’s primary concerns is inflation. One of its 2 jobs is to keep inflation in check. It is always looking for signs that inflation might be coming, because it is easier and less painful to stop inflation before it gets started. Inflation is more than just the price of some good or service increasing. It’s actually a monetary phenomenon caused by two much money chasing too few goods and services. In a rapidly expanding economy, such conditions can develop due to misallocations of capital. So the Fed tries to keep the economy from growing to fast.\\n With inflation being a monetary phenomenon, keeping an eye on the growth of the money supply is important. Early economic theorists thought that only the supply of money matter for inflation, but as it turns out, money has to be spend to produce inflation. If the government creates enough money to give $1000 to each family, if everyone takes it home and hides it in the mattress this will not cause inflation. This article has a nice explanation of how the money supply, the velocity of money and nominal GDP are all tied together and what conditions cause inflation. Basically if the supply of money, the velocity of money, or their combination increase faster than nominal GDP, then inflation will happen. \\n\\n The YChart® above shows the velocity of the MI Money stock. M1 measures the money supply of currency in circulation (notes and coins, traveler’s checks [non-bank issuers], demand deposits, and checkable deposits). It is the narrowest measure of the money supply and can be considered transactions used for current consumption. Note that it was lower in 2017, when the Fed first stepped up the pace of rate increases. In fact, it went up quite a bit at the start of the year. It was only about the middle of the year that the increase in velocity flattened out (it is still increasing slightly). Depending on how the total amount of money was changing, this might or might not be a sign of inflation. \\n\\n\\n The YChart® above shows the amount of the M1 money stock. Note that until very recently, it too was increasing. Below I will look at how much GDP is increasing to see how inflationary this is. \\n\\n The M2 Money stock measures adds saving deposits, certificates of deposit , and money market deposits for individuals to M1. This rate is lower than for M1, because a large portion of it is in the bank and not easily spendable by consumers. Note too that this was increasing lately and only recently did the increase slow down. \\n\\n The YChart® above shows the change in the M2 money supply. Note that while the rate has been declining over the last 2 years, its current rate of increase is 4.22%. With reported GDP growth around 3.5%, this alone will cause inflation. Below we will take a closer look at GDP growth and see if this potential for inflation is above the Fed’s 2% target. \\n\\n The YChart® above shows the velocity of the MZM Money stock. This is the broadest measure of money and it consists of the supply of financial assets redeemable at par on demand: notes and coins in circulation, traveler’s checks (non-bank issuers), demand deposits, other checkable deposits, savings deposits, and all money market funds. Note here that the velocity has been increasing all year, even though it has slowed somewhat from the rate of increase earlier in the year.\\n \\n\\n This last YChart® shows growth in GDP over the last 3 years. The growth shown is pretty substantial, and in large part shows why inflation has so far been fairly muted. According to YChart® the latest month had GDP about 4.3% above last year. Using the M2 figures, it looks like M2 growth is pretty close to GDP growth and that combined with the slightly increasing growth in velocity exceeds GDP growth. Next year GDP growth is expected to slow to about 2.5% or so. Given the growth in the money supply and velocity numbers, I think a case can be made that a rate increase is needed to keep inflation in check I just don’t see how the latest increase can be called crazy. And while I would have liked to see a more dovish statement from the Fed, looking at these numbers I can see why they said what they said. Remember also that they are allowing the bonds on their balance sheet to roll off as they mature, and could if needed redeem them faster or slower to make small adjustments in the money supply. Don’t just do something, stand there! When the stock market is moving as dramatically as it has been of late, there is a pressure to do something, anything to respond to the changes. It’s far easier to tell folks to resist that urge than it is to actually resist it. It is also pretty easy to tell people to buy stocks of great companies now that they are on sale. If you buy today, no matter how great the deal, if the price is lower tomorrow you are going to feel bad. So what is a divided investor to do in these times so they can sleep better at night? One way to benefit from falling prices is to write a cash secured put. This is a contract where you sell someone else the right to sell you 100 shares of some company at an agreed upon price on or before some predetermined time. Since you sold the contract, the other party decides whether or not to sell you his shares for the strike price (the agreed upon price) on or before the contract expires. What you as the seller get is that you are paid an amount of money (called the premium) to wait for the price of the shares to drop to a price you are happy to buy at.\\n Always start this process with a company you want to own. That way you won’t have to deal with the issues involved in avoiding getting the shares or getting rid of them once you have them. Next, pick a share price you are okay with paying to get the shares no matter what the market price might be at the expiration date. Okay, if you insist, here is something to do One company that is on our watch list and has been dropping in price is AT&T (T). So if one bought some shares now in this environment, there is a good chance that the market price would drop over the next week or even month. So writing a cash secured put (cash secured means the seller has the actual cash in their brokerage account, not other shares or money available on margin) could be a way to profit (or hedge any share price drops) from our expectation that the share price might go down in the next weeks or month. In this article (not behind the paywall), PendragonY explains why he wants more T and why he thinks the current price is attractive. \\n\\n Figure 2 E*Trade Order Screen Above is a screenshot of the E*Trade option order screen. The is for writing 2 put contracts on T with a strike price of $26.50 that expires January 18 (next month). I (PendragonY) try to write 2 or more contracts because the initial charge to buy or sell option contract is relatively large and the per contract charge is very small (one contract would cost $5.45 for instance). The estimated proceeds are based on selling the contract for a premium of $0.73 a share (the bid amount). To write this contract you will need $5300 in cash (some brokers will allow this to be reduced by the premium you receive). Another company we like is Newtek Business Services Corp (NEWT) which is a BDC. Rida Morwa wrote an article on it here.\\n \\n\\n Using the forward dividend payment that SA reports, $2, and expecting no dividend growth at all (a very conservative estimate) I have a buy price of $28. Which is well above the price of shares at this time. In fact, the NPV of the dividends over the next 10 years is not too far below the current price. \\n\\n Figure 3 E*Trade Order Screen Here is the screen shot of an order to write 3 puts on NEWT. Since NEWT has gone up almost a $1 today and is trading above $17, the premium for this strike price is small today. It might be better to wait for the price to drop or select another stock. So far, I have twice written puts to take advantage of the potential for price drops in the recent market. \\n\\n Figure 4 E*Trade Transaction Screen Above is a screen shot from my broker that shows those 2 transaction. First, I sold one put on NEWT back on December 21. That was the ex-dividend date for the stocks, and BDCs also took a big hit in price. When I wrote the contract NEWT was selling for around $17.70 a share after a big drop. The contract had just under a week left till expiration, and I was quite willing to pay $17.50. So between the below market strike and the $0.35 premium I got around $0.55 of protection from price drops. So this Monday just past (and a week after the writing the first put), I had more cash available and so wrote 3 puts on NEWT with a $15 strike price that expire on January 18 (23 more days). Coincidentally I got paid $0.35 a share for these puts as well. Currently NEWT is selling for just over $17, so it will have to drop more than $2 for me to get the shares. Either way I get to keep the $98.49 I netted on selling the puts.\\n Conclusion Volatile markets can make investors nervous and uncomfortable. While today seems like it might work out to be an up day (since I started writing this article my portfolio value has gone up ~$7K, and it went down close to that on Monday), it’s important to stick to your plan. Our plans right now includes not selling otherwise good companies because their share price has declined. Our plan also takes advantage of share price declines to pick up some companies I want at bargain prices. One way to do that is to write cash secured puts. You have much the same risks as if you were actually long the stock but you also have some additional downside protection. And don’t think that NEWT and T are the only bargains out there, they just happen to be near the top of my wait list.

Those gains have since evaporated, dropping Box back down into the high teens, currently nearly $16. Now sporting a market cap of just $2.35 billion, why is there no love for Box? The fourth-quarter selloff is a major contributing factor. After hitting $30 in June, Box has been slowly trickling lower. That’s not too surprising given its monstrous two-month run that we pointed out at the top of the article. However, shares are down about 35% so far this quarter and to me that presents an opportunity. Why is Box a good opportunity? In short, as companies continue to increase their reliance on cloud computing, Box continues to provide solutions for them. After the company beat on earnings and revenue expectations for the third quarter, Box CEO Aaron Levie made several important comments on the company's November 28th conference call:  “Enterprises need a central hub for their content, connecting best-of-breed applications while meeting security and compliance demands for multiple industries and geographies.” “Enterprises are choosing Box as a strategic technology partner and the Cloud Content Management platform to power their digital transformation. Content is at the heart of how we work, and it is only becoming more critical as powerful new technologies like AI, machine learning, and workflow create opportunities to make the business processes around content more intelligent and automated.”  Based on commentary from other companies, like Salesforce (NYSE:CRM), Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE) and Splunk (NASDAQ:SPLK), enterprise cloud spending isn’t seeing a hiccup. In fact, it seems to be gaining momentum. Momentum in Box Last quarter the company turned in revenue of $155.9 million, up more than 20% year-over-year (YoY). Box still lost 6 cents per share during the quarter, but that came in a penny ahead of expectations.\\n With three quarters of fiscal 2019 in the books, analysts expect 20.3% revenue growth for the year. In fiscal 2020, expectations call for 20.4% growth. If Box can maintain a ~20% annual sales growth rate and begin to turn a profit, investors will surely push this name higher. Some of the numbers from last quarter suggest that it’s possible, given that add-on services and larger deals are working their way through the pipe. Box now has 90,000 paying customers around the globe. In the last quarter, Box closed 57 deals worth $100,000 or more vs. 40 in the same period a year ago. That’s good for a 42.5% increase. Further, it closed 11 deals worth $500,000 or more vs. just five in Q3 2017, and it closed three deals worth $1,000,000 or more last quarter vs. just one for Q3 2017. In other words, Box continues to land larger contracts, helping to drive top-line growth. What about the bottom line, though? The company’s 6-cent-per-share loss was a solid improvement from the loss of 13 cents per share in the same quarter a year ago. For the year, analysts expect a loss of 16 cents per share and in fiscal 2020, call for earnings of 2 cents per share. \\n\\nSource: Author, from company data Let’s throw a party, right? Maybe those numbers aren’t too exciting, especially when looking at the immense profitability of other well-known mega-cap firms. But Box’s move to profitability comes after the company already made its way into generating positive free cash flow as well as sustaining 20%+ annual sales growth. While decelerating, the company’s growth rate is still impressive, particularly as margins and cash flows are now drifting higher. That’s the kind of momentum we like to see. If Levie & Co. can keep this work up, Box should see its stock price elevate over time, provided that the market doesn’t completely fall off a cliff.\\n Bottom Line on Box Because Box is set on growth mode and not profit mode -- like most cloud stocks -- we will not value it on a P/E basis. Instead, consider that the stock trades at 3.7 times current revenue. That’s less than half the price-to-sales (P/S) ratio that Salesforce trades at and cheaper than Splunk’s 8 times current revenue. It’s also vastly cheaper than Workday (NYSE:WDAY), ServiceNow (NASDAQ:NOW) and Twilio (NYSE:TWLO). Based on free-cash flow (P/FCF), Box is the second-cheapest name, just behind Salesforce. While that doesn’t make Box cheap compared to a name like Procter & Gamble (NYSE:PG), it does make it cheap compared to many of its cloud-enterprise peers. That wouldn’t make Box attractive on its own, but in combination with its major metrics moving in the right direction -- net income, revenue and free cash flow -- the stock looks like a reasonable risk/reward for a speculative position. The company’s integration with Alphabet’s (NASDAQ:GOOGL) (NASDAQ:GOOG) G Suite could pay dividends going forward too. Not only are many users familiar with Google’s G Suite, but it can create a large number of add-on revenue opportunities for Box. Lastly, with its sub-$2.5 billion market cap -- albeit after a severe beating in the market -- Box should be looked at with some M&A potential. Realistically, this is more like a sub-$3 billion enterprise if and when we get a market-wide rebound, but if a larger buyer is interested, Box is certainly attainable. While management has expressed a disinterest in M&A in the past, does not mean it cannot come to fruition in the future. I do not want to buy Box -- or any other stock -- with M&A as a leading catalyst for my ownership. But it’s a nice cherry to put on top. With $200 million in the bank, no short-term debt and just $40 million in long-term debt, Box is a relatively lean company that has solid growth and a reasonable valuation within its industry. At today’s prices, that makes it a buy for me.\\nDisclosure: I am/we are long GOOGL, BOX, CRM. I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions.

Obviously it was a huge surprise for many investors that stocks once again didn’t increase forever (who could have known). It once again wasn’t different this time and even “special circumstances” like low interest rates couldn’t justify sky high valuations forever. In the following article we take a look back at the year 2018, examine where the stock market is standing right now, look at expectations for 2019 and try to find a strategy for long-term investors that works in 2019. We end the article with two stock picks which are already so undervalued in my opinion that opening a position seems a good idea despite the bleak outlook for the general stock market.\\n 2018: A Look In The Rearview Mirror Since 2008, this was the worst year for the US stock market according to YTD performance. In 2015, the S&P 500 declined 0.7% and in 2011, the stock market stayed flat (these were the worst two years during this bull market). In 2018, the S&P 500 declined 9.6% YTD, the Dow Jones Industrial Average declined 9.2% YTD and the Nasdaq-100 trades 5.5% lower than at the beginning of the year. \\n\\n^SPX data by YCharts From its highs three months ago, the Dow Jones Industrial Average declined 16.3% and the S&P 500 declined 17.5% - this is a steep decline and a severe correction, but it is not yet a bear market. The Nasdaq-100 however declined 21.1% since its highs three months ago and is hence officially in a bear market. \\n\\n^SPX data by YCharts When looking at the individual stocks, we find 344 stocks out of the S&P 500 that declined more than 20% from its 52-week high and a decline of 20% or more is usually defined as bear market (the number of stocks that declined more than 20% from its highs might be even higher as for some stocks the decline didn’t solely happen within the last 52 weeks). A second indicator for a bear market is the 200-day simple moving average – when stocks are trading below that line, they are often considered to be in a bear market. Right now, 433 stocks out of the S&P 500 are trading below the 200-day simple moving average (over 85% of the S&P 500 are already in a bear market).\\n 2019: The Road Ahead For 2019, almost all major investment banks and strategists still predict the S&P 500 to close at 3,000 or above (meaning a 25% upside from current levels) and such predictions can only be described as extremely bullish although targets were revised in some cases to a little more cautious predictions. While major investment banks predict the same as always – higher stock prices – my outlook for the next year remains bleak. Many analysts are willing to admit we are in the “mature” stage of the bull market (after almost 10 years and the longest bull market ever), but only very few people speak out what might be the simple truth: We have reached the end of the bull market already and the market is on its way to complete the cycle (and a cycle always consists of a bull market as well as the following decline and bear market). It is particularly concerning that too many people still see current prices as a chance to buy – or even as a great buying opportunity – and don’t realize that even after the drop in equities we witnessed in the last few weeks, stocks are still extremely expensive. The decline during the last three months was probably only the beginning of a steeper correction (to avoid the term crash) and in my opinion we will see a recession much sooner than most are expecting right now (probably during 2019). The stock market will continue to decline and the time to get out has already passed (for those who like to sell stocks and not hold for a very long time). As the S&P 500 reached the 200-week simple moving average and we corrected 20%, it would be not surprising to see a 10% intermediate bullish rally, but this is only interesting for traders. While others are predicting goals of 3,000 points for the S&P 500, in my opinion a realistic goal at the end of the cycle would be about half that number – slightly above 1,500 points could be the bottom and the end of the current cycle (sometime during 2019 or 2020). At about 1,530 points we not only have the 38er Fibonacci retracement, but also the 200-months simple moving average and the former highs of 2000 and 2007. By pulling back to that level the S&P 500 would not only find major support levels, but also confirm the 2013 outbreak above the former highs. This would reflect a decline slightly below 50% and would be similar to declines we saw after the financial crisis and the dotcom bubble.\\n \\n\\n (Source: Own worked created with Metatrader 4) With current estimated earnings, 1,530 points would reflect a P/E of 12 for the S&P 500. But in case of a recession, earnings most likely will contract and lead to a much higher P/E. The CAPE (or: Shiller P/E) would decline to about 17, which seems realistic and would still be a number we only saw once within the last three decades (in 2009 after the financial crisis). Strategy For 2019 In the last few months, I stopped buying stocks and so far, I haven’t regretted the decision. Almost every single stock that is on my watchlist is cheaper right now than it was a few weeks or three months ago. I am closely watching several stocks that are already undervalued in my opinion, but continue to decline due to the overall market sentiment that is dragging down almost all individual stocks. Our strategy for 2019 seems to be guided by two cornerstones – on the one side we still analyze companies according to fundamental criteria and calculate an intrinsic value what individual companies should be worth in our opinion. Despite all theories about rational markets, I assume that stocks are only seldom trading at their intrinsic value, but are often over- or undervalued. On the other side we have to consider sentiment and the possibility of the market falling into a panic mode in 2019 (or maybe 2020) which will provide extremely undervalued stocks. This leads to the situation that already undervalued stocks continue to decline, making it difficult for us to decide if we should buy a stock that is trading below its intrinsic value or wait as Mr. Market might offer us much cheaper prices in the next few months. In my recent article about Facebook (Nasdaq: FB), I pointed out that the stock seems to be incredibly cheap already and that the current valuation doesn’t match the intrinsic value of Facebook at all. However, I am still hesitant to buy, as I suspect the stock will continue to decline further (so far, I have been right). On the one side, I am pretty confident a purchase of Facebook right now will be a great investment over the long term and we will not only achieve at least low double-digits returns, but also outperform the stock market. On the other side, I am quite sceptical for the short term and although I don’t invest short-term, I am still trying to buy stocks as cheap as possible. Over the next few quarters, I assume that many individuals stock will behave similarly to the overall market, which means that even undervalued stocks trading below intrinsic value will continue to decline.\\n And the same thought process I have for Facebook, is also valid for many other companies that are already trading below its intrinsic value or could reach its intrinsic value within the next few weeks. Two Picks For January First of all, I would like to recommend my “Preparing for the end of the cycle” series where I covered several stocks that might become a great investment during 2019 as the market continues to decline and Mr. Market offers great buying opportunities even for companies usually valued with a premium. Right now, I am especially looking at two companies (aside from the above-mentioned Facebook): Compass Minerals International (NYSE: CMP) and McKesson Corporation (NYSE: MCK). Compass Minerals International One of the stocks taking a top spot on my watchlist is Compass Minerals International. Since October 2018, the stock fell from almost $70 to about $40 right now and an already attractive dividend yield increased to 7.1%. Although the payout ratio was above 100% in the last year, I think the dividend is safe as the free cash flow for the next two years is expected to be about $200 million and therefore more than enough to cover the dividend payments. When we look at revenue, earnings per share and free cash flow, we don’t see a clear trend and numbers will continue to fluctuate over the years to come. However, average EPS over the last decade was $4.24 valuing Compass Minerals at a P/E below 10. In the last five quarters, gross margin fluctuated between 23.94% and 32.86% while in the last decade, gross margin fluctuated between 23.9% and 36.8%. Overall, we see a wide range of annual gross margins during the last years, but no negative trend. Compass Minerals has a few short-term problems like the CEO who was “fired” without any clear reason (and the combination of the departure and the massive declining stock price is leading to wild speculations about severe underlying problems). Additionally, production rates at the Goderich mine are still lower than expected. However, as long-term investment, Compass Minerals is still an extraordinary company and especially the mines which will last for decades and the strategic locations of its mines and deep-water port are valuable assets that create a competitive advantage, which is hard to overcome for new entrants or existing competitors. As long-term investment, Compass Minerals is therefore a great pick and when considering the big picture, short-term problems shouldn’t matter. The core business will remain profitable over decades to come and the acquisition in South America wasn’t prefect from a strategic standpoint (as it didn’t widen the moat), but it is a good diversification away from the dependence on winter and snow.\\n Right now, I am hoping the stock will decline a little further to $36.50. At that point, the stock would trade at a 10-year low and would be a terrific entry point. And although we never know what will happen, I would be really surprised if the stock fell even lower (but on the other side I didn’t expect a decline to $40). McKesson Corporation When you are focused on dividends, Compass Minerals might be the obvious choice right now, but in my opinion, McKesson is an even better pick right now (McKesson is paying $1.56 annual dividend, which leads to a dividend yield of 1.44%). Although the company is facing some headwinds like the ongoing discussion about the opioid crisis and new regulations that might result and negatively influence business, the company seems to be in great shape and the sell-off isn’t justified in my opinion. McKesson is reporting solid growth numbers for revenue, earnings per share and free cash flow. Over the last decade, revenue grew 7.7% annually, free cash flow increased even 8.7% every single year and it is true that growth slowed down during the last few years, but the stock was punished beyond reason. McKesson is also a business that is operating with very thin margins. In the last decade, gross margin fluctuated between 5.0% and 6.4% and during the last few quarters gross margin was between 5.06% and 5.96% - in my opinion these are stable margins and we see no hint for a decline. Operating margins fluctuated between 1.1% and 2.0% during the last decade, with margins being between 1.24% and 1.58% in the last quarters. Like I said, margins are low, but are showing the required stability for a great investment. McKesson has about $6.5 billion in long-term and about $2.5 billion in short-term debt resulting in D/E ratio of 0.97 – an acceptable and manageable debt level. When we are trying to value McKesson we can look at the average free cash flow of the last decade ($2,570 million) and when we take that free cash flow as basis (McKesson itself is expecting a free cash flow of $3 billion next year) and assume the same FCF for eternity (0% growth for eternity for a company that grew 8% annually during the last decade), an investment in McKesson is currently yielding 11.51%. I am using this absurd numbers – 0% growth for perpetuity is absurd, and taking the average free cash flow of the last decade also seems to be a bit too conservative – to show how undervalued McKesson is in even that scenario.\\n Conclusion I know I could be wrong, but after the decline at the beginning of the year was only a foreshadowing, I think we saw the begin of a steeper and long-lasting decline in the US stock market (long-lasting meaning between one and maybe three years). 2018 was the worst performing year for the US stock market in the last decade, but I assume 2019 will even be worse. Therefore, I am very cautious about buying stocks right now as the chance is extremely high that we will get almost every single stock much cheaper in a few months from now. In order to be successful as investor, you don’t have to buy every stock at the bottom. As long as you are confident the stock is undervalued on a fundamental basis, it doesn’t matter to pay maybe 10% or 20% more than the cheapest price Mr. Market is offering (and therefore buying CMP or MCK makes sense). However, when we expect the market to decline in a major way and we know that only very few companies can resist such a broad decline in stock prices, it doesn’t appear to be very smart buying stocks right now.\\nDisclosure: I am/we are long CMP.

Is that the reaction you expected?\" (Ronald Surz)  If A Recession Is Coming  \"If a recession is coming, the odds favor a longer and deeper bear market (-42% over 17 months on average). But there\\'s much variation within those odds... In the 1990-91 recession, stocks declined only 20% over a 3-month period, and during the 1929-33 depression, stocks declined 86% during a 33-month period.\" (Charlie Bilello) Thought For The Day According to Charlie Bilello\\'s always excellent data, the fact we\\'ve hit bear-market territory this week does not necessarily imply that we will have a recession. His article (linked above) does a nice job of presenting the data, which range widely. We just don\\'t know how big a bear, if there will be a recession and if so, when it will come. Indeed, the chance of a recession accompanying the bear market, based on historical probability since 1929, is just 55%. That, of course, is a tad above even odds. And yet, I think a recession will likely coincide with such bear market as does develop. The reason is that, despite the recent high rates of U.S. GDP and employment growth, there are simply too many underlying sources of risk for the economy, one or more of which can easily trip it up. First, interest rates have been rising rapidly. We don\\'t know, until the economy slips, how well it can tolerate those rate hikes, but my guess is not well, and for a simple reason: Debt at every level is extremely high. Having low rates for so long provided a perverse incentive to take out nearly free loans. Today, interest on corporate debt, consumer debt, and need I add, government debt will all need to be paid at much higher rates than originally assumed. Add just a little more stress - loss of a customer, loss of a job, weaker tax collection - and the less resourceful corporations, people, and governments will go bankrupt.\\n Secondly, the U.S. is among the stronger economies today, but so much of the rest of the world is in considerably worse shape, yet facing the exact same stresses. So as the rest of the world normalizes interest rates, we may see some quick collapses that can affect the global economy like a chain of dominoes. In other words, the world has grown hooked on cheap money, and turning off that spigot may be enough to send the most vulnerable economies into recession. But if not, the addition of a further stress, like tariffs and trade wars (if not resolved soon enough), can tip the balance. Third, the shock resulting from the popping of asset bubbles is sometimes enough to bring on recession, as we saw precisely 11 years ago. Assets such as stocks or real estate carry a wealth effect, and a sudden freefall in wealth naturally depresses economic activity. In that sense, it seems logical to suggest that the more stocks fall without the economy falling into recession, the better chance we\\'ll have of adjusting to the new situation and thus avoiding an impoverishment-induced recession. In sum, the economy faces a number of high-level risks, any one of which of, or combination thereof, can tip the economy. But as I noted with respect to stocks falling, our ability to effect a soft landing may be key to helping us avoid a recession. In that sense, it\\'s actually a good thing that the Fed has been letting some of the air out of the bubble. The trick is calibrating how much we can do this without sending our economic balloon flying all over the place. Similarly, it would be desirable for governments, and consumers, to gradually let the air out of their own balloons. -- Please share your thoughts in our comments section.

All data as of Dec. 26, 2018.'], 'article': ['\\n\\n Ever since the launch of the first emerging markets products, investors have been sold on the idea that adding such product to their portolios would add uncorrelated investment exposure to their domestic investments. As we saw however during the last financial crisis, even though there was a uncorrelated performance during the bull markets, in bearish markets, these products were sold off just as much, if not more than their domestic investments. Even if there is a lack of uncorrelated exposure, emerging markets such as India and China should benefit in the long term largely due to their underlying demographical trends. For this reason we discussed India in my previous article, \"iShares MSCI India ETF: Investing In The \\'Big Picture\\'\" Having now experienced the beginning of a bear market in the United States, let\\'s take a look at how the iShares MSCI India Index ETF (INDA) has performed and whether or not it has added any uncorrelated exposure in 2018. Investment Case While I am by no means an expert on India or have any opinions on their current political parties or developments, I do believe the predominant reason to invest in India is the demographics. As I wrote in my previous article, India is today the 5th largest economy in the world and is expected to double to $5 trillion by 2025. The country is a leader in producing highly educated engineers who are creating a thriving tech economy. In fact, the Harvard Business School states that India\\'s educational institutions produce more engineers than China and the United States combined! \\n Beyond the large and growing educated workforce, the country presents a $5 trillion investment opportunity in infrastructure spending urgently needed to supporting the grow middle class. Because I do not claim to be an expert on India nor do I have the capacity or the ability to get \"my boots on the ground\", I believe using a managed product is the optimal way for most investors to gain exposure to this theme. The largest product in this space is the iShares MSCI India ETF (INDA). What\\'s New Fund Basics  Sponsor: iShares. Index: MSCI India Index. AUM: Approximately $4.605 billion (12/26/2018), down from $5.248 billion as of our previous article on 5/15/2018. Historical Style: Emerging Markets Large Caps - India. Investment Objectives: The iShares MSCI India ETF seeks to track the investment results of an index composed of Indian equities. Number of Holdings: 78 securities. Current Yield: .84%. 30 Day SEC Yield Inception Date: 2/02/2012. Fees: .68%.  Source: YCharts & iShares The most meaningful difference since our initial article is that the fund has shrunk its assets under management by nearly 12% to under $5 billion. \\n\\nINDA data by YCharts Looking at YCharts data we can see that through the end of November the fund had indeed lost capital to outflows (investors selling shares) rather than underlying performance. \\n\\n Source: YCharts Looking at the top 10 holdings, we can see the top 10 holdings remain the same, with small differences in allocations.\\n \\n\\n Source: iShares Where we do see a change is that today the fund\\'s top 10 holdings make up 50.67% of the portfolio, up from 47.8%, making this fund even more concentrated than it was. This is one of the issues I believe investors need to be aware of when investing in passive market capitalization based methodologies which by nature, over-concentrate on the largest companies, rather than the ones that present the most upside or lowest risk.   \\n\\n Source: iShares As expected with the top 10 remaining the same, the fund\\'s sector breakdowns also remain largely unchanged. Where there was a bit of change was in the market capitalization with Mega/Giant caps now making up 63.2% of the fund versus 58.01% as of 5/11/2018. \\n\\n Source: YCharts Small and mid cap companies are largely missing from the fund. Performance So, how did the fund perform? As previously discussed, the fund was launched after the 2008 Financial Crisis. As such, the fund\\'s performance experience has generally been limited to the overall bull market with a few small periods of market corrections. During this time, the fund sustained a maximum drawdown of 29.62% and achieved a 5 year beta of .8577, suggesting approximately 15% less volatility than the underlying benchmarks.\\n \\n\\n Source: YCharts Since our initial article on May 15th, the fund is down 1.77% on a price per share basis and .86% on a total return basis. Interestingly, the fund has recovered quite a bit from the November lows. \\n\\nINDA data by YCharts Is the fund disconnected from domestic volatility? Seemingly yes... but for the worse? \\n\\nINDA Total Return Price data by YCharts As we can see, the fund is down 7.69% for the year on a total return basis, slightly worse than the S&P 500. As you may know, the fund has plenty of competitors, both India focused passive and smart beta ETFs including the WisdomTree India Earnings Fund (EPI), iShares India 50 ETF (INDY) and PowerShares India Portfolio (PIN), along with open and closed end mutual funds such as the Matthews India (MINDX), Wasatch Emerging India (WAINX), Eaton Vance Greater India (ETGIX), India Investment (IIF) and Aberdeen India (IFN) funds. For the year, the iShares India fund has outperformed its ETF peers. It has however fallen behind the Aberdeen India (IFN) and the Wasatch Emerging India (WAINX) funds. \\n\\nINDA Total Return Price data by YCharts\\n India has has some economic uncertainties and as a result large and mega caps were the safest place to hide and why I believe INDA and the more concentrated (INDY) have performed well in this down year. It is once we go back to a broader market, such as the previous three years, where we find the passive nature of the iShares ETF was a drag on returns. \\n\\nINDA Total Return Price data by YCharts For the longer term \"set it and forget it\" investor, I still believe any of the actively managed products with analysts whose boots are on the ground, are the more appropriate investment choice.  \\n\\nINDA Total Return Price data by YCharts Bottom Line So far this year, the Indian investments have had seemingly low correlations to the domestic bear market. The passive iShares ETF has further shown that it has managed to reduce the risk versus most peers. Since inception however, the four passive and smart beta products from iShares, Invesco and WisdomTree have been outclassed, not by mere percentage points, but multiples. I very much believe in how I summed up the previous article on this fund:  Don\\'t get me wrong, there are plenty of places where low-cost passive investing makes sense... inefficient emerging markets such as India IS NOT one of those areas. What is worse, however, is that the difference in performance between the passive ETFs and the actively managed ones is too great to justify buying the passive ETF in order to monetize the volatility through writing options for income while at the same time limiting the upside growth. \\n Source: iShares MSCI India ETF: Investing In The \\'Big Picture\\'\\nDisclosure: I/we have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

Each of these tell a story, but they also have carry a lag effect. When these indicators become concerning is usually when the market has already priced in that fear. However, it is important to consider them in an overall examination of market movement.\\n All Traders: Put-Call Ratio People are scrambling. They are buying puts at high levels of premium to hedge against what they perceive could be a massive down turn in the market. The amount of puts being purchased is near all-time highs, matched only by numbers in March of 2009. This is a huge rush towards protection, signaling that the market could be oversold. The fact that the put-call ratio is above 1, currently hovering around 1.8, shows that investors are extremely bearish. \\n\\n  Source: Erlanger Research The ISEE Sentiment Indicator Another indicator, the ISEE Sentiment Index, is telling a similar story. In this metric, the lower the number is, the more bearish the indicator is, and only retail customer purchases are included. The 50 DMA is at 90. The median value since September of 2008 is 101, with an interquartile range from 85 to 120 for the same time period. The range since the beginning of 2018 has been between 84 and 114. With a value of 137 today (12/26/18), and we just popped outside of the third quartile in an extremely bullish fashion for the past ten years and the past year, posting the highest call-put ratio since the beginning of the month. There is a massive tug of war between the bulls and the bears, according to the movement within this ratio. \\n\\n  Source: Nasdaq The Relative Strength Index According to the Relative Strength Index ratio, the market is quite oversold, with this metric hovering around 28. Historically, the market is considered oversold when this number dips below 30, and overbought when above 70. However, the market can remain quite oversold for a while, and could take time to regain its previous momentum. Or it could take little-to-no time. After all, as John Maynard Keynes says, \"the market can remain irrational longer than you can stay solvent\".\\n \\n\\n Source: Crystal Bull The Fear Index and The Percentage of Bears The Fear Index and the percentage of bears are both up. Bullish sentiment is very low. Bearish sentiment is very high. The historical average for bulls is 38.5%, which is currently hovering around 24.9%. The bears account for almost half of all investors, up 17% from their historical average. However, according to AAII, when this divergence happens, higher-than-median returns for the S&P 500 Index tend to follow.  \\n\\n  Source: AAII People are nervous, and for the first time in a while, that is what is driving the market. For the past few years, investors have been overzealous and overconfident, but now, anxiety seems to be the markets guide. Scared money tends to make many mistakes.  \\n\\nSource: CNBC Volatility: It Really Isn\\'t That Extreme Finally, the VIX is up, bouncing between 30 and 35 for the past week. It is up almost 300% from 2018\\'s low of 8.92. If you told any investor that you were long volatility a few months ago, it would have been laughable. Now, it would been quite the trade (I suggested it back in October). \\n\\n \\n Source: Yahoo Finance For the next 6 months, VIX futures are priced in over 20, according to the chart below. The market could be pricing in a bigger down-move in equity prices with these relatively high future estimates in the VIX, but these cycles are to be expected, especially considering the suppressed levels of volatility over the past few years. The market moves, and we should let it move.  \\n\\n  Source: VIX Central How the Market is Responding The S&P 500 and the Dow are down 15% from September highs. Only 18% of stocks are above their 200 DMA. We saw something similar back in early 2016, and stocks went on to bounce back to all-time highs. However, keeping history in mind, this drawdown obviously isn\\'t as extreme as the -50% we experienced during the Recession. But it is a painful drop, and one of the worst Decembers that the market has seen in a while, despite the recent 1,000 point rally in the Dow Jones. The below December 2018 return is now (11.5%), using data through 12/26/2018.\\n\\n  Source: Asymmetry Observations Calm Down: It is Just a Cycle There is a lot going on in the world, with geopolitical tensions, economic weakness overseas, government shutdown, supply chain uncertainty, and trade confusion. We cannot expect the market to continue to always go up in the face of such uncertainty, nor can we expect volatility to remain at all-time lows, nor can we expect it to crash on a linear trajectory. The indicators discussed in this article give a glimpse into how investors are responding to a downturn, and it isn\\'t pretty.\\n Good returns are great. Seeing a double-digit return in a portfolio at the end of the year is an incredible feeling. But understanding that the market must recover is something that goes with the territory of investing. Nothing can last forever. There is so much nervous money in the market now. It is important to understand that down days are normal, and are to be expected. Gigantic upswings should be taken with a grain of salt, as the market cannot continue on this path forever. It has to take a breather, and take a break. It does not mean that it is fundamentally broken. Artificially pumping returns with share buybacks and excessive liquidity injections will only make the up days better, but they will also make the down days worse. Letting the market swoon and sway is how it heals. The Law of Large numbers tells us that it will always revert to the mean. It will not continue down, or accelerate to new highs, forever. We cannot continue pushing it to extremes, or else it will explode. The Fed has to hike rates, and they must do so from information gathered from past data. No one can predict the future. The Fed is in charge of managing the economy, not asset prices. Cycles are a natural part of existence, and the stock market is simply potentially entering a down cycle. Investors should think about holding onto trades that are core to their investment philosophy, or taking a bigger position into gold or t-bonds if their nerves are frayed. \\n\\n  Source: Morgan Housel However, what the above chart showcases is the reward of patience. Holding a basket of stocks over a long period of time delivers stellar returns. Stocks tend to have an upwards drift, and that enables the possibility of long-term returns. The day to day can be unpredictable, as it has been recently, but long term, we can expect stocks to move up.\\n The Power of Corrections: The Reversion to the Mean The market has larger moves to the downside, but tends to revert to the mean overtime, which is follows that of an upwards movement. As Tasty Trade noted, \"markets trickle up and crash down\". We see big movements to the downside, but it tends to reverse itself back to the trend after a while.  \\n\\n  Source: Tasty Trade Finally, as more and more people come up proclaiming the risk of a recession or prolonged correction or the potential for a massive move upwards, it\\'s important to remember that investors are inherently irrational. Price changes are fat-tailed and correlated with a multitude of variables. And year end price targets are almost always wrong. Over the past thirteen years, the average miss has been 10.7%. People want to know what other people think is going to happen to the market. The average price target for the S&P 500 at the end of 2019 is 2,974, which would be a 568 point, or 24%, increase from the current 2,406 level.  \\n\\nSource: The Irrelevant Investor We cannot predict the future, yet. But we can do our best to read the data and make predictions that align with our personal risk-reward profile. Paying attention to indicators is important, but they carry a relative lag effect. Paying attention to reversion to the mean is also important, and considering the relative movement of the S&P 500 against the rest of the world tells an important story, as nothing can truly go up forever. International has a lot of room to the upside, and with the dismal returns of EMs over the 2018, they could be posed for a good buy soon. The GMF, an Emerging Asia Pacific ETF, is trading almost 28% below 52-week highs at a PE ratio of 12.42.\\n \\n\\n Source: Charlie Bilello\\nDisclosure: I/we have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

Most investors would not consider UBS ETRACS Monthly Pay 2x Leveraged Closed-End Fund ETN (CEFL) a particularly good instrument to hedge against or take advantage of a sharply rising equities market. However, for a portfolio that is constrained to only buy securities with current yields above 15%, CEFL is one of the only games in town. The recent price decline has brought the CEFL dividend yield on an annualized monthly compounded basis to 22.6%. Another reason to consider CEFL is that the average discount to book value for the components of the ISE High Income™ Index (YLDA) upon which CEFL is based was 15.48% using data available as of December 24, 2018. I compute the average discount to book value of the CEFL components periodically. I do not compute the average discount to book value of the CEFL components every day. That said, the 15.48% average discount to book value of the CEFL components is the highest I have ever computed. One problem is that the annual rebalancing of the index, where the components can be changed significantly, makes comparison with earlier values for the discounts to book value less useful. However, even with that caveat, a major driver of the price movements for CEFL and the closed-end funds in the index has been the discounts to book value.\\n The previous highest average discount to book value I computed for the high dividend closed-end funds that comprise the index upon which CEFL and its unleveraged version, the YieldShares High Income ETF (YYY), was 13.8% on September 18, 2015. The lowest was 6.9% on July 28, 2016. Over a 0.86-year period, buying on September 18, 2015, and selling on July 28, 2016, the annualized gain, including reinvesting dividends for CEFL, was 31.74%. The best time to buy high dividend closed-end funds usually has been when the discounts to book value have been the largest. On January 22, 2018, the average discount to book value of the 30 high dividend closed-end funds that comprise the index upon which CEFL and YYY are based was 8.55%. Using data available as of December 22, 2017, the average discount to book value of the 30 high dividend closed-end funds that comprised the old index was 7.06%. A substantial portion of the relative price fluctuation in CEFL has been due to changes in the discount to book value. Since the latest 15.48% average discount to book value of closed-end funds that make up the current CEFL index is the highest I have ever calculated, that could suggest a significant buying opportunity. A reason for caution, at times, has been that some of the dividends paid by the components of CEFL include return of capital. Because of significant changes in the composition of the index, comparisons of the proportion of the dividends from return of capital to previous levels may not be very meaningful. Additionally, some of the monthly data used to calculate return of capital are just estimates subject to revision. Using data available as of December 24, 2018, indicated that 10.8% of the CEFL dividend consisted of return of capital. Using data available as of October 31, 2018, indicated that 16.3% of the CEFL dividend consisted of return of capital. Using data available as of November 27, 2018, indicated that 11.1% of the CEFL dividend consisted of return of capital. My calculation using available data as of December 28, 2016, before the 2017 rebalancing indicated that 17% of the CEFL dividend consisted of return of capital. The low 10.8% current percentage of return of capital could be a cause for optimism, or just a blip in the unreliable data.\\n When considering yields on 2x Leveraged ETNs, such as CEFL, there is another separate factor that could be considered similar to return of capital, that is becoming more significant as the Federal Reserve increases short-term interest rates. An investment in CEFL is functionally the equivalent of buying the 30 high dividend closed-end funds that comprise the index upon which CEFL is based, in a brokerage account using 50% margin. Thus, the value of that hypothetical margin account and the value of CEFL would be expected to move either up or down twice the amount that an unleveraged account holding the same 30 closed-end funds, moved on a percentage basis. In both the margin account and CEFL, there is interest expense. In the margin account, the brokerage firm charges interest on the margin loan that is used to finance the 50% leverage. In CEFL, there is an imputed interest fee, called a financing expense, that is based on 3-month LIBOR now 2.75%. The financing expense is 3-month LIBOR + 0.40%. This is currently 2.75% + 0.4% = 3.15%. For most retail investors, the interest on margin loans charged by brokerage firms is far higher than the imputed financing expense in CEFL. For example, Fidelity now charges accounts with less than a margin balance of $25,000, an interest rate of 9.825%. The rate varies with changes in market interest rates and accounts with higher outstanding margin balances pay less on a sliding scale. For accounts with outstanding margin balances over $1,000,000, the current Fidelity rate is 5.50%. TD Ameritrade charges 10.75% on accounts with less than $10,000, charges 10.5% on accounts with $10,000 - $24,999, and 8% on accounts with outstanding margin balances over $1,000,000. In addition to the interest on margin loans changed by brokerage firms, there would usually be commissions and fees on the transactions associated with buying the 30 high dividend closed-end funds that comprise the index upon which CEFL is based, and possibly rebalancing transactions to maintain the 50% leverage or changes in the index. In addition to the implicit financing expense based on 3-month LIBOR, CEFL has a 0.50% annual tracking fee. In both the margin account and CEFL, the fees and expense reduce the total return to the investor. However, in the margin account, interest expenses and other fees are broken out in the account statement. In funds like YYY, the fees and expenses reduce the income paid in dividends. For 2x Leveraged ETNs, such as CEFL, the interest and tracking fees reduce the net indicative (asset) value.\\n To the extent that the dividends paid by 2x Leveraged ETNs, such as CEFL, are higher than they would be if the interest and tracking fees were taken from the dividend, the dividend could be considered to include a return of capital. This is separate and distinct from any return of capital associated with some of closed-end funds that comprise the index upon which CEFL is based. This factor was relatively very small when 3-month LIBOR was only 0.25% from 2010 through 2015. However, with 3-month LIBOR now at 2.75%, it is more significant. For example, the CEFL dividend yield on an annualized monthly compounded basis is now 22.6%, based on my projection of the January 2019 CEFL monthly dividend of $0.1744. That calculation is based on a projected annual CEFL dividend of $2.277. Adding the financing expense of 3.15% to the 0.50% annual tracking fee brings total expenses, including interest to 3.65%. If that was taken out of the dividends rather than the net indicative value, the projected annual CEFL dividend would be $1.838 and the annualized monthly compounded basis would be 17.9%. The total return would be the same whether the expense was taken out of principal or income. However, for those who have 2x Leveraged ETNs, such as CEFL, in taxable accounts, you would be paying taxes on higher dividends, that would be the case if the expenses and fees were taken out of the dividends rather than the net indicative value. The lower capital gains or larger capital losses, for tax purposes, from taking the expenses and fees from net indicative value, would usually not offset the higher taxes on the dividends. The treatment of interest expense is now more significant for 2x Leveraged ETNs, such as CEFL because of the higher short-term interest rates resulting from the tightening by the Federal Reserve. That is not the main reason that the major determinant for the outlook for 2x Leveraged ETNs will be the Federal Reserve\\'s actions. This is discussed in the recent article: The Federal Reserve Holds The Key To The Outlook For The 2x Leveraged Mortgage REIT ETNs. That article describes how almost all political policy news and economic variables such as unemployment, inflation and growth are now important for the outlook for 2x Leveraged ETNs, mainly to the extent that they can influence decisions and actions by the Federal Reserve. Making the situation even more uncertain, it is not clear how the Federal Reserve would react to a number of specific events. For example, a surge in inflation resulting from increased tariffs could cause the Federal Reserve to be more aggressive in raising rates. Alternately, a surge in inflation resulting from those tariffs could cause the Federal Reserve to consider that surge in inflation to be a one-time event, and not raise rates.\\n The extent to which the Federal Reserve has taken on even more importance for financial markets than usual was seen when Chairman Powell\\'s press conference after the recent meeting where rates were increased prompted a decline in the stocks and bonds. That caused some to say that the Federal Reserve is now a bigger issue for the markets than trade policy on a day-to-day basis. Is The Rationale For My Investment In 2x leveraged High-Yield ETNs Still Intact? More than five years ago in July 2013, I laid out my economics-based rationale for investing in the UBS ETRACS Monthly Pay 2X Leveraged Mortgage REIT ETN (MORL) and mREITs in A Depression With Benefits: The Macro Case For mREITs, which set forth the premise that overinvestment caused by tax policy is the primary driver of the business cycle and that the inequality resulting from the then existent tax code made me a buyer of MORL. That article included in part:    ...In free-market capitalism, capital generates income for the owners of the capital which in turn is used to create additional capital. This is very good. Sometimes, it can be actually too good. As capital continues to accumulate, its owners find it more and more difficult to deploy it efficiently. The business sector generally must interact with the household sector by selling goods and services or lending to them. When capital accumulates too rapidly, the productive capacity of the business sector can outpace the ability of the household sector to absorb the increasing production. The capitalists, or if you prefer, job creators use their increasing wealth and income to reinvest, thus increasing the productive capacity of the business they own. They also lend their accumulated wealth to other business as well as other entities after they have exhausted opportunities within business they own. As they seek to deploy ever more capital, excess factories, housing and shopping centers are built and more and more dubious loans are made. This is overinvestment... ... The Revenue acts of 1926 and 1928 worked exactly as the Republican Congresses that pushed them through promised. The dramatic reductions in taxes on the upper income brackets and estates of the wealthy did indeed result in increases in savings and investment. However, overinvestment (by 1929 there were over 600 automobile manufacturing companies in the USA) caused the depression that made the rich, and most everyone else, ultimately much poorer... Since 1969, there has been a tremendous shift in the tax burdens away from the rich on onto the middle class. Corporate income tax receipts, whose incidence falls entirely on the owners of corporations, were 4% of GDP then and are now less than 1%. During that same period, payroll tax rates as percent of GDP have increased dramatically. The overinvestment problem caused by the reduction in taxes on the wealthy is exacerbated by the increased tax burden on the middle class. While overinvestment creates more factories, housing and shopping centers, higher payroll taxes reduce the purchasing power of middle-class consumers... \\n In 2013, the recovery from the financial crisis that began in 2007 was well underway. Many were forecasting that higher interest rates were imminent. My view was that interest rates would stay lower for longer. The was based in part on my view that the Federal Reserve was not artificially depressing short terms risk-free interest rates but rather was prevent them from declining even more. In 2013, I said in Federal Reserve Actually Propping Up Interest Rates: What This Means For mREITs:    ...Most investors now believe three things about the Federal Reserve, money and interest rates. They think that the Federal Reserve is artificially depressing rates below what would be a \"normal\" level. They believe that in the process of doing so the Federal Reserve has enormously increased the supply of money and they believe that the USA is on a fiat money system. All three of those beliefs are incorrect...  I updated that article on August 23, 2018, with: Federal Reserve Actually Propping Up Interest Rates: What This Means For mREITs: An Update which presented new evidence supporting my original conclusions that the Federal Reserve has been and still is keeping interest rates higher than what a free market in risk-free short-term fixed-income securities would be. The relationship between interest rates and the Federal budget deficit has been a matter of concern for many decades. Clearly, borrowing by the US Treasury to finance the deficit tends to put upward pressure on interest rates. A related risk occurs when the Federal Reserve acts to punish what it perceives as bad government policy, by raising rates. From the late 1970s until, arguably 2007, the Federal Reserve at times, used monetary policy to dissuade politicians from what the Federal Reserve considers profligate fiscal policy. The term \"bond market vigilantes\" referred to financial market participants who voted with their money against the inflationary impacts of government deficits by selling treasury securities. However, it was usually the Federal Reserve that took on the major role of punishing politicians when it considered fiscal policy too inflationary.\\n My theories regarding monetary policy and the impact on the business cycle resulting from the shift in the tax burden away from the rich and onto the middle class are the basis for my investment strategy as much now as they were five years ago. Certainly, an over-investment induced recession caused by the reduction in taxes on the wealthy and exacerbated by the increased tax burden on the some in the middle class has become much more, sooner than later likely as a result of the 2017 tax bill. Thus, a booming stock market rally could benefit CEFL which has components that hold equity-like junk bonds. However, it could hasten the ultimate recession and ideal environment for very interest sensitive securities such as MORL. This was a rationale for including CEFL in a portfolio along with MORL. The mREIT-based portion of that portfolio now includes in addition to MORL: Credit Suisse X-Links Monthly Pay 2x Leveraged Mortgage REIT ETN (REML) and for new purchases, the UBS ETRACS Monthly Pay 2X Leveraged Mortgage REIT ETN Series B (MRRL), which is essentially identical in all economic respects to MORL. Analysis Of The January 2019 CEFL Dividend Projection While typically called dividends, the monthly payments from CEFL are technically distributions of interest payments on the ETN note based on the dividends paid by the underlying closed-end funds that comprise the index, pursuant to the terms of the indenture. All but three of the CEFL components pay monthly dividends. ClearBridge Energy (CEM) and Liberty All Star Equity Fund (USA) pay quarterly, but have November 2018 ex-dates. Thus, they will not be included in the CEFL January 2019 dividend projection. Morgan Stanley Emerging Markets Domestic Debt Fund (EDD) is the only quarterly component that will be included in the CEFL January 2019 dividend projection. There were changes in the dividends declared by the CEFL components that will impact the CEFL January 2019. PIMCO Dynamic Credit Income Fund (PCI) declared a special dividend of $0.35 with an ex-date of December 14, 2018, and a regular monthly dividend of $0.164063 with an ex-date of December 12, 2018. Thus, both of those PCI dividends will contribute to the CEFL January 2019 dividend. Blackstone/GSO Strategic Credit Fund (BGB) increased its monthly dividend to $0.11 from the prior $0.105. From the data in the table below, I calculated a projection for the January 2019 monthly CEFL dividend of $0.1744. The table shows the ticker, name, weight, dividend, ex-date, price NAV and contribution to the dividend for the CEFL components that will contribute to the January 2019 CEFL dividend.\\n Conclusions And Recommendations With the discount to book value of CEFL at the highest level I have ever seen, CEFL would seem to be attractive as a stand-alone investment and/or as a diversifier for high yielding 2x leveraged high-yield ETNs that have less credit risk but more interest rate risk, such as MORL, MRRL and REML. Including CEFL in my portfolio of 2x leveraged high-yield ETNs as a diversifier has been relatively expensive when compared to what my total returns would have been if I had held only MORL as compared to a mixture of MORL and CEFL. I have also used the UBS ETRACS 2xLeveraged Long Wells Fargo Business Development Company ETN (BDCL) as a diversifier for my MORL holdings. From the inception of CEFL on January 7, 2014, when CEFL closed at $27.03 to the closing price of $11.09 on December 24, 2018, the total return on CEFL was -1.93%, assuming reinvestment of dividends. Over that 4.96-year holding period, this was an average annual total return of -0.39%. Those who bought CEFL at the initial offering price of $25 on January 7, 2014, did somewhat better. In contrast, over the same period based on the MORL\\'s closing price on January 7, 2014, of $19.95 and the closing price of $14.73 on December 24, 2018, the total return on MORL was 67.46%, again assuming reinvestment of dividends. Over the 4.96-year holding period, that was an average annual total return on MORL of 10.94%. I have also used BDCL as a diversifier for my MORL, MRRL and REML holdings. That has turned out even worse, relative to simply holding only MORL. Using the 4.94-year holding period, BDCL had a total return based on the closing price on January 7, 2014, of $29.83, and the closing price of $11.08 on December 24, 2018 of -15.64%, again assuming reinvestment of dividends. Over the 4.96-year holding period, that was an average annual total return on BDCL of -3.37%. Stocks and fixed-income securities, in a sense, compete for shares of investors\\' portfolios. A decline in the equity market can cause some investors to rebalance their portfolios to shift out of fixed-income securities into stocks. Likewise, a decline in the fixed-income market can cause some investors to rebalance their portfolio and shift out of stocks into fixed-income securities.\\n Federal Reserve tightening can hurt all financial markets simultaneously. Likewise, Federal Reserve ease can boost all financial markets simultaneously. The interaction between President Trump\\'s willingness to overtly criticize the action of the Federal Reserve and how Chairman Powell might react to that creates additional uncertainty. One bullish scenario is that Chairman Powell might take a more dovish stance, and even not hike rates in 2019, so as to not give President Trump an excuse to blame the Federal Reserve if the economy weakens. That would be particularly good for of 2X leveraged high yield ETNs. I am still cautiously bullish on CEFL as a diversifier for my holdings of 2X leveraged high yield ETNs that are based on mREITs. CEFL is one of the few instruments that provide a very high yield and some ability to benefit from a rising stock market. However, policy risks that have arisen as a result of the 2016 election are now becoming more pronounced. The uncertainty of possible impacts from possible protectionism, federal budget deficits, possible overheating in the economy and monetary policy suggests large fat-tail risks in both directions in the equity market and fixed-income markets. This would lead investors who have a significant portion of their portfolios in CEFL to consider adding MORL, MRRL or REML to hedge against the risk of much weaker economic growth. This would enable them to maintain the high income that CEFL now delivers. Likewise, MORL, MRRL, and REML investors might want to consider adding CEFL or BDCL in order to hedge the against a high real growth scenario. SMHD and SMHB could be utilized by investors who want to only invest in one 2X leveraged ETN since it contains both interest rate sensitive components and credit risk sensitive components. The yields on all of the high-yielding 2x leveraged ETNs like CEFL are still compelling. However, the uncertainty regarding economic variables means that significant event risks exist in addition to the risks inherent with the ETN\\'s use of leverage. This is in addition to the leverage employed by many of the components that make up the indices upon which these ETNs are based. I am diversifying the large proportion of MORL, MRRL, and REML in my portfolio with some CEFL and BDCL since there is a small possibility of much stronger economic growth than I expect.\\n At any time, there could be a perception on the part of many market participants that there will be much stronger economic growth. This should be considered by shorter-term investors. If something catastrophic were to occur, like severe protectionism or an oil shock, it would be expected that the stock market would decline sharply, but MORL, MRRL, and REML could do better as investors seek the safety of agency mortgage-backed securities and the Federal Reserve lowers interest rates. YYY is an unleveraged ETF that is based on the same index as CEFL for those that might want to benefit from a rising market in higher yielding securities but are more risk-averse. In view of the uncertainty and risks, active traders might consider waiting until the impacts of the Iran decertification, protectionism, federal budget deficits and monetary policy on economic conditions become more clear. However, a lesson we can learn from the last few years is that waiting for price declines in high-yielding instruments like CEFL, MORL, MRRL, and REML can backfire, as the large dividends forgone by waiting exceeds the savings from a lower purchase price. MORL and, later, MRRL and REML have been the primary instruments by which I have attempted to utilize my longer-term macroeconomic outlook to manage a high current yield portfolio given some very significant constraints. The most important constraint is to only include securities with current yields above 15%. Other constraints are the typical retail IRA account restrictions which preclude the use of margin borrowing and futures contracts. I suspect that there are many individuals, particularly those either partially or totally retired, who either have somewhat similar constraints or could possibly benefit from adopting them. Given those constraints, the universe of possible investments is very limited. Other than junk bonds and other securities issued by individual distressed entities, in order to meet the 15%+ constraint, my primary investment focus in the quest for 15%+ current yield has been and is on 2x Leveraged High-Yield ETNs.\\n These have included, in addition to MORL and MRRL, REML, the UBS ETRACS Monthly Pay 2x Leveraged Closed-End Fund ETN (CEFL) and the UBS ETRACS 2x Leveraged Long Wells Fargo Business Development Company ETN (BDCL). REML is based on the FTSE NAREIT All Mortgage Capped Index of mREITs. That\\'s the same index used by the iShares Mortgage Real Estate Capped ETF (REM). REML is based on a slightly different index of mREITs than that upon which MRRL and MORL are based. I use REML as a somewhat interchangeable substitute for MRRL and MORL. While MRRL, REML, and MORL are my core holdings, I have utilized CEFL and BDCL as diversifiers and for hedging possible macroeconomic outcomes. An addition to my diversifiers was the ETRACS Monthly Pay 2xLeveraged US Small Cap High Dividend ETN (SMHD). It started trading on February 3, 2015. It is based on the Solactive US Small Cap High Dividend Index. More recently I have added UBS ETRACS Monthly Pay 2xLeveraged US Small Cap High Dividend ETN Series B (SMHB), which is based on the same index. The yield on SMHD and SMHB exceeds both CEFL and BDCL and is only slightly less than MORL. One interesting aspect of SMHD and SMHB is that they may be diversifiers for CEFL. This is because closed-end funds are excluded from SMHD. Originally, I looked at SMHD as a diversifier for MORL since SMHD has many equity issues that would do well in an environment of higher levels of economic activity. However, SMHD and SMHB have a fairly large number of mREITs that are also in MORL. Since SMHD and SMHB excludes closed-end funds there is no overlap with CEFL. There are some concerns about SMHD and SMHB. The tracking fee is a relatively steep 0.85%, as compared to 0.40% for MORL and 0.50% for CEFL. As with any high yielding instrument, there is usually some reason which it is trading at a level that results in a high yield. Thus, many of the components of that are depressed for various reasons. The two largest components of SMHD and SMHB are GameStop (GME) and Spirit Realty Capital Inc. (SRC).\\n Both of those components have had some problems in the past year but are still paying relatively large dividends. The components of the index upon which SMHD and SMHB are based are selected based in part of the security\\'s \"Forward-Looking Distribution Yield,\" which is more useful than historical data but in some cases involves educated guesses as to what the future dividends will be. On October 9, 2018, UBS announced that it has suspended further sales from inventory of SMHD. That put SMHD in the same category as MORL, in that it can now trade significantly above its indicative (net asset) value. MORL has an essentially identical twin MRRL that is still being created and sold by UBS. Until September 6, 2018, MORL and MRRL traded very close to each other and to their net indicative (asset) value which is identical for both. The price relationship between MORL and MRRL changed after September 6, 2018. UBS announced that they would no longer issue any new shares of MORL. The price of MRRL has continued to closely track net asset value since that announcement. However, MORL began trading far above MRRL (and the net asset value of both). The spread between MORL and MRRL eventually widened out to $0.97 on September 17, 2018. This enormous spread prompted my article: Sell MORL, Buy MRRL which included: ..Just because MORL can possibly trade at a significant premium to net asset value does not mean that it should. This is especially true since the identical twin MRRL is still available at very close to net asset value. There may be some sort of a short-squeeze occurring in MORL. These are dangerous to participate in from either side. However, some short-term traders may want to get involved. For investors who own high yielding 2X leveraged ETNs for the very high current yields. If they are making a new purchase, MRRL is a better buy than MORL at present prices. Those that own MORL may want to take advantage of the historic spread and sell MORL and use the proceeds to buy MRRL...\\n The spread between MORL and MRRL narrowed dramatically soon after the article appeared on Seeking Alpha. The spread has bounced around since then, with MORL generally trading higher than MRRL, but not approaching the spread levels seen on Friday, September 17, 2018, and on Monday, September 20, 2018, prior to the article appearing on Seeking Alpha. On December 24, 2018, MORL closed $0.17 higher than MRRL. I am using MRRL\\'s price for yield calculations since that would be the logical one to buy for most investors. When SMHB started trading on November 9, 2018, it presented an arbitrage opportunity similar that exists involving MORL, MRRL, and REM. MRRL and MORL are essentially identical. SMHD and SMHB are based on the same index and thus have identical components. However, their base levels are not identical. Thus, on December 24, 2018, SMHD closed at $12.00 while SMHB closed at $16.98. As with MRRL and MORL, the older version SMHD, which is no longer being sold by UBS, began trading above its net indicative (asset) value, while the new SMHB kept trading very close to net asset value. This prompted my article: Sell SMHD Yielding 21.5%, Buy SMHB Yielding 23.6% that described how to adjust the prices of SMHD and SMHB so that it can be determined by how much SMHB is a better value relative asset value than SMHD at any given time. Since 2012, I have been willing to collect and reinvest the approximately 20% average yield on a monthly compounded basis that 2X Leveraged ETNs pay, while the ultimate answers to questions about the outlook for the economy and securities markets are revealed. I still am. When the yields rise above 25% on price declines, as is currently the case, it has been a buying opportunity. My view is that there will likely be more reductions than increases in the Federal Funds rate during the next five years. Furthermore, the possibility exists that Trump\\'s trade policies could precipitate a Lehman collapse like event. In a scenario like that, 2X Leveraged ETNs would be one of the best places to be.\\n If you are reading this, you probably are an investor in, or at least a potential investor in 2X Leveraged ETNs such as MORL, MRRL, REML, CEFL, SMHD, SMHB, and BDCL. In my article, \"BDCL: The Third Leg Of The High-Yielding Leveraged ETN Stool,\" I said that BDCL is correlated to the overall stock market but may be a very good diversifier for investors seeking high income who are now heavily invested in interest rate-sensitive instruments. Previously, I pointed out in the article \"17.8%-Yielding CEFL - Diversification On Top Of Diversification, Or Fees On Top Of Fees?\" those investors who have significant portions of their portfolios in mREITs and, in particular, a leveraged basket of mREITs such as MORL, MRRL and REML could benefit from diversifying into an instrument that was correlated to the S&P 500 (SPY). I still tend to believe that the massive tax-policy-induced increase in inequality will cause increasing excesses of loanable and investable funds, above commercially reasonable ways to utilize those funds. This will eventually result in an overinvestment cycle with a recession, and that will ultimately be very good for the 2X Leveraged ETNs. However, there does exist now some possibility that there may be some reversal of the shift in the tax burden away from the rich and onto the middle class as a result of the midterm elections and the Democrats taking control of the House of Representatives. There are other significant risks as well. Taking all of this into consideration, I\\'m still a cautious buyer of 2X Leveraged ETNs and have added to them recently. When one of the UBS 2X Leveraged ETNs based on similar index as another can be bought lower than the other one, it would make sense to buy whichever was cheaper. Until September 6, 2018, MRRL, REML and MORL traded very close to their net asset (indicative) values, as MRRL and REML still do. When MORL was trading at a large premium to net asset value, selling MORL and buying REML was a good move. This was particularly relevant for those whose MORL was held at Fidelity, which allows new purchases of REML but only allows sales of MORL. It might be noted that while Fidelity does not now allow new purchases of SMHD, it does, as of now, allow new purchases of SMHB. While all 2X leveraged ETNs have some possibility of early redemption, the possibility is more remote for SMHB than for SMHD. That is possibly why Fidelity allows new purchase of SMHB and not SMHD.\\n It should be kept in mind that economic and policy uncertainty that seems to be diverging rather than converging. This means that significant event risks exist in addition to the risks inherent with the ETNs\\' use of leverage. This is in addition to the leverage employed by many of the components that make up the indices upon which these ETNs are based. Presently, CEFL offers a reasonable relative opportunity to diversify a high-yield portfolio with a very high concentration on mREITs. The recent market declines have made all of the 2x Leveraged High Yield ETNs more attractive, as their yields are higher due to the lower prices. My calculation projects January 2019 monthly CEFL dividend of $0.1744. The implied annualized dividends based on the last three months would be $2.277. This is a 20.5% simple annualized yield with CEFL priced at $11.09 On a monthly compounded annualized basis, the yield is 22.6%. If someone thought that over the next five years, equity markets and interest rates would remain relatively stable, and thus CEFL would continue to yield 22.6% on a compounded basis, the return on a strategy of reinvesting all dividends would be enormous. An investment of $100,000 would be worth $276,697 in five years. More interestingly, for those investing for future income, the income from the initial $100,000 would increase from the $22,600 initial annual rate to $62,464 annually.

I mistakenly lent my voice to that consensus a year ago when the retailer\\'s valuation looked too low to ignore. Even noted value investor Joel Tillinghast of Fidelity argued that the shares were cheap based on future cash flows. In the two years I have written for Seeking Alpha, my November 2017 buy case for BBBY has been my worst call by far. Since that time, the stock has plunged more than 50 percent. Shares are at their lowest level in 20 years. What happened? In two words, profit margins. BBBY\\'s deteriorating margins, now at less than 5 percent, are already below what I considered the \"doomsday scenario\" with no sign that they will improve soon. Fierce competition has left the chain struggling, even with a booming economy and strong consumer. Chasing Fool\\'s Gold BBBY did - and still does - have a few good things going for it. The company is profitable and generates a lot of free cash, $1 billion of which sits on the balance sheet. The company\\'s solid financials and rock bottom P/E attracted many value investors, some of whom speculated that the retailer could be sold to private equity. I myself touted the company as a sum-of-the-parts play based on the value of the company\\'s cash flow and ownership of the Christmas Tree Shops (and That!) discount chain. However, no one predicted just how fast and far that cash flow would shrivel up. Between 2012 and 2018, BBBY\\'s revenue grew from $9.5 billion to $12.3 billion as the company opened more and more stores, but the operating margin fell from 16.5 percent to just 4.9 percent over the same period. Comparable store sales have also trended negative over the last few years.\\n As a result, earnings fell from a $1 billion in 2013 to $350 million over the last twelve months. The company also took on $1.5 billion in debt and plowed much of the proceeds into stock repurchases, with little to show for it. Shareholders simply obtained a bigger piece of a shrinking pie, while the company blew its equity on buybacks at a time when the valuation was far higher. While chains like Macy\\'s (M) at least own valuable real estate, BBBY follows a leasing model. Since 2014 when it took on debt for the first time, liabilities outweigh current assets. Nearly all of BBBY\\'s market value comes from its future cash flows, which now look dubious. The Seeds of Failure Although the immediate cause of BBBY\\'s fading fortunes is crumbling margins, the seeds of failure were sown long ago in the company\\'s insular culture and resistance to change. As Amazon (AMZN) and discounters like Walmart (WMT) and Target (TGT) marched across the retail landscape, BBBY clung to a business model centered around physical retailing in suburbia and ubiquitous coupons. The company has lagged badly in e-commerce, perhaps out of reluctance to cannibalize high margin in-store sales with low margin online sales. Where department stores and \\'category killers\\' like Best Buy (BBY) closed hundreds of locations, BBBY inexplicably continued plowing capital into opening new stores. Lethargy at the top likely played a role in BBBY\\'s misfortunes. BBBY operates much like a private firm in practice, tightly controlled by management and insiders. Co-founders Warren Eisenberg and Leonard Feinstein, both in their 80s, remain influential as co-chairmen of the board. Steven Temares, 60, a longtime employee handpicked to succeed the founders as CEO fifteen years ago, has remained at the helm despite the litany of failures. As recently as three years ago, Temares earned $20 million in compensation. In a rare rebuke, Institutional Shareholder Services recommended earlier this year that investors vote against the renomination of board member Victoria Morrison, citing her lack of relevant experience. Morrison submitted her resignation after losing the vote, but BBBY\\'s board rejected her offer to quit. In 2015, Institutional Shareholder Services awarded BBBY a 10 for governance, its worst possible score.\\n Too Little, Too Late Lately, the company seems to have recognized the seriousness of its situation. BBBY bowed to investor pressure by jettisoning several elderly board members and cutting executive compensation. Expansion is now off the table, with the company considering closing forty stores after leases expire this year. Acutely aware of the chain\\'s heavy product overlap with competitors like Amazon, management is trying to inject more differentiation into BBBY\\'s weak product range. On the Q4 2016 earnings call, the word \"differentiated\" appears more than twenty times. Still, wholesale change seems unlikely. The same old faces who remain in charge now talk of new initiatives not bearing fruit until 2020. Analysts broadly agree that the company is moving too slowly on e-commerce. Management argues that it is taking the long view of the future, but it is increasingly uncertain whether the company even has a future at all. If BBBY is underperforming in a strong economy and the best consumer environment seen in years, how will it withstand the next downturn? Retailing is a precarious business that requires a great deal of working capital. Even a temporary downturn in the business can rapidly lead to default if the company does not have enough cash on hand to pay suppliers and landlords. BBBY may have $1 billion on the books now, but what happens if the company stops turning a profit? The chain owns no real assets, so there is no floor on this decline.\\nDisclosure: I/we have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

How much of my portfolio should be allocated to bonds? Corporate, foreign or treasuries? Long-term or short-term? How much protection can I get from bonds? In this article, I aim to tackle the question: short-term treasuries or long-term treasuries? Utilizing a simple model, I build an index that allocates to short-term treasury bills or longer-term treasury notes depending on underlying economic conditions. 10-year Treasury Bonds: A Natural Hedge? Popular wisdom suggests that a portion of a portfolio should be allocated toward bonds, as bond returns are generally uncorrelated to stock returns and are sometimes even negatively correlated. This line of though is commonly used to describe the 10-year treasury notes, the well-noted risk-free standard for anything with that long a duration. The popular wisdom goes as follows. 10-year treasury returns are generally independent from stock markets returns, so allocating a portion of a portfolio to treasury notes is the smart choice as it diversifies the portfolio! Hey, but that is not all. As treasury notes are risk-free, when panic arises in equity markets investors will flee toward the safe returns of the treasury bonds, rising its prices and thus increasing returns for its holders, therefore providing a slight hedge against equities. This applies to all medium and long-term treasury notes of course. Really, it applies to any risk-free debt that is not generally expected to be held until maturity (So price changes affect returns too).\\n Then, it’s better to hold medium- and long-term risk-free bonds than cash or shorter-term risk-free securities because of two things: higher returns and the natural hedge that they provide. However, this is not always true. The longer the maturity of a bond the higher its price sensibility to interest rates. So if interest rates rise, prices go down and have a negative impact in returns. It follows then, that we should consider where interest rates are going when we decide between longer- or shorter-term securities. Short-run long-term interest rates John Roberts, of the Federal Reserve, described a method to estimate the neutral short-run long-term interest rates. More precisely, the neutral 10-year treasury rates in the short-run. As the author emphasizes, the short-run equilibrium rate can be useful in helping determine where policymakers may want to lead interest rates in achieving maximum sustainable employment in the short run. Before proceeding, I ought to clarify the distinction between the short-run and the long-run neutral interest rate. Again, per John Roberts, “A short-run equilibrium rate is one that stabilizes the economy period by period, whereas the long-run equilibrium is the value of the interest rate that will stabilize the economy down the road; in the long run.” The point of departure of Roberts’ model is the common, economics 101 IS curve. The curve states that, being all other things equal, higher interest rates (in this case, long-term interest rates) should imply weaker economic activity.  xgapt = η xgapt-1 − σ (Rt − Rtn ) Where xgap is the output gap, Rt is the real long-term interest rate, and Rtn is the neutral long-term interest rate. The equation says that when interest rates rise, the output gap falls. The neutral interest rate can be defined as the interest rate that will lead to GDP growing at potential given that the output gap is initially zero. We can estimate the neutral rate of interest by rearranging the equation (1) as follows:  Rtn = Rt + ( xgapt − η xgapt-1 ) / σ \\n The only two parameters of the equation, σ and η, reflect the sensitivity of the output gap to interest rates and the speed at which interest rate changes are reflected in spending respectively. The author set the persistence parameter (η) to 0.75, consistent with the literature. For the sensitivity parameter (σ) Roberts considered values ranging from 0.75 to 3.5, again, according to the existent literature. In this article I’ll only use the estimates that used σ = 0.75 for simplicity. Selecting between long-term or short-term treasury bonds We can use Roberts’ estimates to get an idea of where the 10-year treasuries should be at any given time so that the economy grows at potential. Obviously, although new monetary tools such as Quantitative Easing allow the Fed to alter longer-term interest rates, their main focus is in the short-term rates. But we can assume that long-term rates fluctuate around the neutral rate, as the Fed would keep manipulating short-term interest rates if they were unable to close the output gap, to the point that the longer-term rates get close enough to the neutral rate that the gap starts to shrink. With that rationale at mind, I built a simple index (I’ll call it bond timing index) that allocates everything to the iShares 7-10 Year Treasury Bond ETF (IEF) (ETF that tracks 7-10 year treasury notes) whenever the 10-year yield is higher than the neutral rate (Negative output gap). On the contrary, the Index allocates everything to 3-month treasury bills (As a proxy of the SPDR Blmbg Barclays 1-3 Mth T-Bill ETF (BIL) ) when the 10-year yield is lower than the neutral rate. The index intends to get out of longer-term notes whenever it expects interest rates to rise (thus negatively impacting prices) and get in when it expects the opposite. The limitations of the simple bond-timing index are evident though. It fails to account for the size of the expected change in interest rates and also fails to reflect the benefits of bond diversification. A more thorough index would allocate bills and notes into the same portfolio, weighting each of them according to the size of the different between the actual yields and the estimated neutral interest rates. Nevertheless, that does not mean that the index is not a useful experiment for analysis.\\n The results should be taken with a grain of salt. Not only because of the index limitations, but also because of limitations with the data. We only have IEF data since 2002 and it is extremely difficult to calculate quarterly 10-year treasury notes’ estimated returns based only on its yields (the available information). \\n\\n (By the author) \\n\\n (By the author) As you can see in the table, the bond-timing index had slightly lower annualized returns than the IEF. However, given that it had lower volatility, its Sharpe ratio was slightly better, suggesting better risk adjusted returns. As I previously stated, these results should be taken with a grain of salt. But the most important thing to take home with this limited dataset, is how similar returns were even when the bond-timing index spent almost half of the periods fully invested in bills (27 out of 62 periods). This fact alone suggests that there is something to take out of the experiment. That leads to the question, where do we stand right now? Well, given that the US economy has a positive output gap, the neutral interest rate, by definition, needs to be higher than the current 10-year treasury yield. It follows then that the index would be allocating toward short-term bills. Investors should take what this simple model tells us into account, particularly when looking at a flat yield curve, in which 3-month bills’ yields don’t differ all that much to 10-year bonds’ yields. This gives reasons to believe that the traditional negative correlation between 10-year treasuries and the stock market won’t hold up in the near future, and that a bigger allocation toward short-term securities than usual is called upon.\\n\\nDisclosure: I/we have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

My name is Chris, and I’ll be your coordinator for today. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. We will conduct a question-and-answer session towards the end of this conference call.\\nI would now like to turn the call over to CSPi Chief Financial Officer, Gary Levine. Please proceed, sir.\\nGary Levine\\nThank you. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. With me on the call today is Victor Dellovo, CSPi’s Chief Executive Officer.\\nBefore we begin, I’d like to remind you that during today’s call, we’ll take advantage of the Safe Harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 with respect to statements that may be deemed to be forward-looking under the act. The company cautions that numerous factors could cause actual results to differ materially from forward-looking statements made by the company. Such risks include general economic conditions, market factors, competitive factors, pricing pressures and others described in the company’s filings with the SEC. Please refer to the section on forward-looking statements included in the company’s filings with the Security and Exchange Commission.\\nDuring today’s call, after Victor provides an introduction, I’ll discuss our fourth quarter financials. Victor will come back for an update on our business segments and on our strategic progress. And then we’ll open it up to your questions.\\nWith that, I’ll turn it over to Victor.\\nVictor Dellovo\\nThanks, Gary. We had a busy fourth quarter to end fiscal year 2018. We closed on the sale of our Germany operations, transitioned the accounting for our UK office to Florida, continued to develop our next-generation cybersecurity solutions, including introducing a new cybersecurity application and recently signed two new partnerships to expand our reach.\\nFinancially, fourth quarter revenues were down 31%, primarily due to lower multicomputer sales, product sales in the UK and in the U.S. and the delay of the launch of our ARIA Software Defined Security solution. On the bottom line, we reported net income of $16.2 million, or $4.07 per diluted share, which includes a gain on the sale of our German operation of $16.8 million.\\nIn our High-Performance Products segment, we continued to experience stronger-than-expected demand for our legacy Myricom network adapters and further developed our next-generation ARIA SDS cybersecurity solution.\\nIn our Technology Solutions, our U.S. operations benefit from an increased demand for our IT managed services. After Gary reviews the financial results for the quarter, I’ll come back with a detailed review of our achievements and our progress in Q4 by segment. Gary?\\nGary Levine\\nFor the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018, revenues were $19.6 million, compared to $28.4 million a year ago, reflecting delays in launching the new ARIA SDS solution, lower multicomputer sales and products and royalties and lower product sales in the U.S. and UK for the TS Division.\\nOur total cost of sales declined $14.8 million from $21.3 million in the prior year period, in line with the lower sales volume. Gross profit for the quarter was $4.8 million, down from $7.1 million a year ago. Gross margin, however, at 24.7% was essentially in line with 24.9% a year ago.\\nFourth quarter engineering and development expenses were $925,000, up from $615,000 a year ago. As a percentage of sales, Q4 engineering and development expenses rose to 4.7% from 2.2% last year, as a result of the higher level of investment in our ARIA solution.\\n\\nEngineering and development expenses were in line with the Q3 of 2018 on a sequential basis. We expect this level to continue through the development phase of our next-generation cybersecurity products.\\nQ4 SG&A expenses were $5 million, or 25.7% of sales, compared to $4.7 million, or 16.8% of sales in the previous year. The increase was primarily due to compensation, severance in the UK and legal expenses.\\nWe had a fourth quarter tax benefit of $341,000, compared to a tax expense of $623,000 last year. The effective tax rate for the quarter was 32.9%, compared to 37.9% in the prior year.\\nNet loss from continuing operations was $700,000, or $0.18 per share, compared to net income of $1 million, or $0.27 per diluted share a year ago. Net income from discontinued operations was $16.9 million, or $4.29 per diluted share, which includes the gain of $16.8 million for the sale of our German subsidiary and includes $93,000 for the two months we owned the German operation in the quarter.\\nCash and short-term investments were up to $25.1 million, with $14.4 million of proceeds from the sale of our German subsidiary.\\nLastly, our Board of Directors voted to pay a quarterly dividend of $0.15 per share to shareholders of record on January 7, 2019, payable January 22, 2019. Our financial priorities in the first quarter of 2019 continue to be to improve our bottom line performed by increasing the level of high-margin products and contain cost across the organization.\\nI’ll now turn the call back to Victor.\\nVictor Dellovo\\nThanks, Gary. Let’s jump into our segment review, starting with our High-Performance Products division. HPP revenues were $3.1 million, down 28% from last year, primarily due to the delay in the launch of our ARIA SDS product, as well as lower multicomputer revenues that Gary mentioned.\\nWhile the computer revenues were mainly for spare parts and boards for the E-2D and E-2D foreign military program. At this point, we have not been given details on the total order levels for 2019 for the U.S. We do anticipate revenues for the E-2D foreign military program, with most royalties being recorded in the second-half of the year.\\nDemand for our legacy Myricom products were stronger-than-expected, as we continue to benefit from the sales of our ARC Series 10 gig network adapters. By developing new software features and working with equipment manufacturers to integrate our Myricom technology into their own, we have been successful in stemming the anticipated decline in the product line.\\nOn a full-year basis, Myricom revenues were high, up high single digits, clearly reversing our original downwards forecasts. Equipment manufacturers are now using Myricom cards for two different purpose.\\nFirst, the cards can be used as an intelligent add-on to manage multiple NG [ph] towards in packet capture processes. By using our cards, manufacturers increase the performance of cybersecurity application in a cost-effective way. And second, our adapters improved the speed of our financial trading, which we achieved by offloading the data from their application and process into data at significantly higher speed. Our adapters enable equipment manufacturers to track operations in real-time with more accuracy than expected packet capture devices.\\nThese value-added capabilities have enabled us to further decline of our legacy product, as we continue to develop our next-generation cybersecurity products, including our new ARIA platform. Our ARIA solution provides advanced cybersecurity protection capabilities for critical data assets that need to be assessed by the end users in applications, both in the cloud and on-premise.\\nDuring the past year, we worked on completing the ARIA platform, which tends to support various specific security application. The first is our ARIA SDS microHSM application that offloads encryption and key management away from the whole CPU. This improved application performance and reduced costs, while delivering better performance than traditional hardware security modules.\\n\\nIn August, we announced the release of our second application, which focuses on our virtualized key management, a new ARIA SDS KMS application simplify the serving of encryption keys and certificates required to properly encrypt data. Traditionally, with self-encrypting drives, the data was protected by just one key for the entire system, making the information vulnerable during cyber attacks.\\nOur ARIA KMS application servers thousands of unique key per second, enables VMware and SAN Encryption and provide substantial more security environment. The ARIA KMS application is unique in a fast set up, ease of use, flexible implementation options.\\nIn addition to fitting with the customer’s existing service, it is easy to integrate with an interested solutions, without the need for in-house cryptologist experts in high-deployment costs. Overall, ARIA takes a radically different approach to enterprise-wide data security by focusing on enhanced network security and ensuring applications data impenetrability.\\nIn September, ARIA was named the winner of the Enterprise Encryption Solution of the Year Award from CyberSecurity Breakthrough, an independent organization that recognizes top company technologies and products in a global information security market.\\nThis year, the award affected more than 3,000 nominations from 14 different countries around the world. We view our win as proof that the market is demanding data security solutions that are both easy to deploy and cost-effective.\\nAs you know, we have been experiencing delay in the launch of our ARIA platform due to supplier issue. We expect to be able to conduct testing and valuation in January and should see sales ramp-up in the second-half of fiscal 2019. As we work through the supplier issues, our team has been busy essentially, new partnerships to increase revenues and expand our reach.\\nIn November, we added Chestnut Hill Technologies and Egoseal to our global network of resellers and distributors of our legacy Myricom adapters in future cybersecurity products. Based in Massachusetts, Chestnut Hill Technologies, we provided our security technology consulting services and strategic IT application services, mainly serving companies on the East Coast.\\nIn response to growing demand for our security development deployment, they will now integrate our solution for enterprise, looking to decrease time to incident response, improve breach in investigations and notifications and cost effectively enhance network security posture.\\nEgoseal, based in China, has a strong expertise in database, vulnerability scanning, assessment protection, monitoring and penetration testing. Together, we will be addressing the growing need for data and network security in China in broader Asia Pacific markets, including Taiwan, Hong Kong and Singapore. We are excited to work with our new partners and look forward to expanding the reach of our security solution.\\nTurning now to our Technology Solutions business. Quarterly revenues were down 31% year-over-year, mainly due to lower product sales in the U.S. and the UK, partially offset by the strength in the service business in the U.S. On a full-year basis, the Technology Solutions business continues to deliver year-over-year growth and profitability.\\nDuring the quarter, we closed on the sale of our German operations to European IT service provider and media conglomerate Reply, the €10 million, or about $11.7 million. As we previously shared, the increase in difficult competitive environment in Germany and lower-than-expected profitability compelled us to divest the business. The positive financial effects for the sales provided us [the lease up and time] [ph] to invest in high-margin managed services opportunities.\\nIn the UK, revenues were down for the fourth quarter, as well as reduced sales from a large multinational organization. We have right-sized the UK business by adjusting headcount and the team is in the process of moving our offices to reduce fixed cost. We continue to serve our multinational customers with a team of engineers that work on a project basis. We expect a profitable Q1 2019 in the UK with our new streamlined structure.\\n\\nIn the U.S., the increase in our service sales was driven by growth of our managed IT services. During the quarter, we added new clients and established high billing rates for new and existing customers.\\nIn July, we began realizing additional monthly revenue from our private cloud contract and we are now fully managing the private cloud. Separately, we continue to expand the number of managed firewalls to other firewall partnerships.\\nOur sales in the U.S. continues to build our managed service pipeline [indiscernible] more profitable prospects. Taking all these factors into account, we are confident we will continue to deliver growth in this segment in Q1 2019 and beyond.\\nI would like to take a moment to thank our entire team for executing on our transformation strategy and for making our company a great place to work. We were recently named one of the Florida’s Best Companies To Work by Florida Trend magazine. Our workplace was evaluated for policies, practice, philosophy, systems and demographics and overall employee satisfaction.\\nIn closing, we worked hard in fiscal 2018 to continue to transform CSPi from a company focused on defense-related multicomputers to one with significant growth opportunities in cybersecurity and wireless managed service markets. As you can – as we discussed earlier on July 31, 2018, we sold all of the stock of our – outstanding stock of Myricom GmbH for $14.4 million cash and recognized a gain of $16.8 million.\\nThe divestiture of the German operation and our increased cash position will enable us to focus time and resources on a higher-margin and greater potential growth opportunities. We are encouraged by the traction of our managed service business in the U.S. and we tend to continue to invest and focus on our new ARIA SDS cybersecurity products and to capitalize on the proliferation of our wireless service business.\\nWe have done a good job making progress in those areas within our control. For example, we are proud of our efforts to develop new cybersecurity applications for our legacy products and our new-generation platform for cybersecurity products. We have invested in engineering, talent and created new partnerships to continue our focus on innovation and to expand our market opportunities.\\nAt the same time, we are simply focused on managing cost and improving profitability. We look forward to keeping you up-to-date on our transformation progress.\\nWith that, I’ll turn it over to the operator to take your questions. Thank you.\\nQuestion-and-Answer Session\\nOperator\\n[Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from [Brett Davidson] with – who is an individual investor. Please go ahead.\\nUnidentified Analyst\\nGood morning. How are you, guys?\\nGary Levine\\nGood morning.\\nVictor Dellovo\\nGood morning.\\nUnidentified Analyst\\nYou’ve got a lot of sunshine down in Florida there?\\nVictor Dellovo\\nYes, as always.\\nUnidentified Analyst\\nYes. We got a rare day with a little fun peeking through, so that’s a good thing. So I wanted to get into – well, actually, let me give you a clarity first. I got a little bit of a writer’s cramp to put my questions there or so if you care with me here.\\nGary Levine\\nGo ahead, Brett.\\nUnidentified Analyst\\nI’m looking for a little clarity on that E-2D. So it was just spares in the most recent quarter. And is that pretty much what’s come through in Q1 and what Q2 looks like?\\nGary Levine\\nWell, we’ve got – yes, there’s some spare parts, then there was a few royalty boards, not a plane or anything like that, Brett, it was very small. And we don’t have really much in the second quarter, and it really looks like we’ll have some stuff in the third and fourth quarter. But as Victor noted, we haven’t really gotten that much information out of Lockheed as to what the delivery schedule will be.\\n\\nUnidentified Analyst\\nYes. So – and I think you indicated too that some of that was for the Japanese planes. Has that been a continuing trend there?\\nGary Levine\\nWell, that – we know that they’re at least from what’s been written that they’re going to be getting planes. We haven’t really been told or we just anticipate.\\nUnidentified Analyst\\nGot it.\\nGary Levine\\n…I mean, as we indicated last summer, that we would probably get some foreign military. They don’t tell you what it’s going to be.\\nUnidentified Analyst\\nGot it. So I’m looking for a little clarity regarding accounts receivable and inventories. Are there levels we’re seeing on the balance sheet currently? Are those like reasonable ranges where we can expect going forward?\\nVictor Dellovo\\nWell, first of all, the inventory, a lot of it is – a big portion of that is timing for orders, so within the TS group. So a lot of it’s drop ship, so things shift. So under the revenue recognition rules a lot of times, we don’t get to do it and we don’t get notice. So that’s a big chunk of it.\\nAnd the receivables, probably, I mean, as far as there’s a good flow on the cash, it’s just on the business side what happened. So as we get more growth, hopefully, we’ll have bigger numbers in there, in the short-term.\\nUnidentified Analyst\\nGot it. So yes, I’m just trying to get a handle from the cleaving off the German subsidiary, what – whether those are reasonable levels, or if it’s further adjustment that’s going to be as a result of the sale or that’s pretty much what we could normally expect?\\nGary Levine\\nWith the kiosk business, it’s just difficult, because the business, as Victor can tell you, comes in chunks. We get some big orders and it’s the timing of them from an inventory standpoint or receivable standpoint. And as in many businesses, the end of the quarters, there’s a big rush to get things out, so you tend to have…\\nUnidentified Analyst\\nBut there’s no.\\nGary Levine\\n…higher people.\\nUnidentified Analyst\\nThere’s no further adjustments due to the German subsidiary sales?\\nGary Levine\\nNo.\\nUnidentified Analyst\\nYes. So – got it. Maybe if you guys could just clarify the statement in the press release that talks about growing our managed IT pipeline with larger and more profit – profitable prospects? So I mean, is that come to fruition in Q1 and looking good for Q2, or is that something you anticipate a little further out or how exactly that shake out?\\nGary Levine\\nA lot of the pipeline that we’re looking at right now with larger organization, multibillion dollar organizations, where managed wireless practice, as I mentioned in the past, has been doing really, really well. And that’s one of the areas that a lot of companies – sometimes, when you look at managed services, they may not be as interested as taking over their full infrastructure.\\nBut a lot of companies, a multibillion dollar companies don’t want to manage wireless, so that’s something that we’re talking to a lot of large organizations, whether financial or school systems that we’re looking at taking their wireless infrastructure over as a managed service recurring revenue model. So that where that comment comes from.\\nUnidentified Analyst\\nAnd I mean, is this stuff that you anticipate closing soon, or there’s a timeframe that going to push this out sometime or…?\\nGary Levine\\nWell, as you know, you can’t control customers, but it’s things that we have been working on, I would say, six months or more already. So, if everything works out and we’re able to win the opportunities, I would say, it’s more sooner than later, but I can’t guarantee anything right now. But they have been in the works for a long time. And like I said, I think that hopefully with some luck that they’re close, but I can’t guarantee anything that will be awarded. But we have been working diligently with them for probably six months or so.\\n\\nUnidentified Analyst\\nOkay. But there’s so many moving parts. So with the big jump in the cash balance, I mean, all kinds of opportunities open up. And getting out of the Technology Solutions business over in Germany and weak sales over in the UK, I mean, you guys actively pursuing, moving some of those other divisions, or – and how does that look as far as deploying some of their cash? Is there any plans yet to put some of that to work?\\nGary Levine\\nYes. Everything is on the table. Acquisitions are always a possibility, we’re looking at every – everything right now. So, with that cash stay, but it will need to be fit into the – our current strategy and would need to be accretive over some period of time, if we were looking at to do something like that, that’s the plan right now.\\nUnidentified Analyst\\nI know that there’s huge constraints regarding doing a buyback. But has that been explored, and has a one-time special dividend also been discussed?\\nGary Levine\\nWell, we look at that. And I think when we increased the dividend from $0.12 to $0.15, that was something that we were considering sort of one-time. We kind of look at it over a period of time.\\nUnidentified Analyst\\nAnd…\\nGary Levine\\nBut everything is still on the table for discussions. We do bring it up every quarter at our Board meetings.\\nUnidentified Analyst\\nYes. I’m not even sure whether you could do an effective buyback, but has there been any discussion of maybe pulling some shares at the current prices?\\nGary Levine\\nWe’re viewing that, Brett. We’ve had some discussion. I mean, obviously, last quarter we were at some pretty high levels. And so now what’s going on in the market, maybe something we’ll take a closer look at.\\nUnidentified Analyst\\nGot it. And maybe if you could just – the last one here just give me some color on what – how Q1 is shaping up?\\nGary Levine\\nYes. Brett, we don’t really give forward guidance on that. So, I know you use usually try to ask that, but…\\nUnidentified Analyst\\nI’m not looking so much for guidance or revenue or earnings, it’s just kind of a quality – or a qualitative look at what Q1 looks like. I mean, you guys really active or…?\\nVictor Dellovo\\nYes, things are going in the right direction. The only thing that we’re anxious on is delivery of some of the boards we need for the new ARIA. But everything else, Myricom has been, as I mentioned, been doing better than we anticipated. We thought it was going to be closer to 10% to 15%, 20% decline over the last two years. We made some changes to kind of keep that acquisition now we did a few years back moving in the right direction. So we’re pretty happy with that.\\nTS has been – it’s been doing well last year with a great year. The UK, it has a couple of big customers. If they all buy at the same time, it does really, really well. One of the big customers we had bought so much last year that we knew this year that weren’t going to have the same spend, and that’s kind of way you saw some – the decrease in revenue and profitability in the UK would be basically just one customer who bought a huge deal last year that didn’t do that this year.\\nSo, with – we – part of their realignment in the UK was to get rid of some of the people that we’re working with Germany. And that side, we got rid of them fortunately, but they had to move on. So we right-sided that ship, I think, on cost. So moving forward, I feel pretty comfortable with the UK. And TS is over the years, every year, it’s profitable and it’s been growing.\\nMy focus is to continue with the managed service with our recurring revenue model and anxiously waiting to get the boards that we need from our supplier with the ARIA. There is a lot of customers anxious to get their hands on the board to do some evaluation and that’s kind of what we’re waiting for right now.\\n\\nSo everything that we’ve – I’ve been talking about, I think, is moving in the right direction. The only hold up that’s slowing us down is not at the software we’re developing. We are on schedule with everything we’re supposed to be doing. It’s just getting those boards to put the software on and it’s been delayed just to some chip issues that they had, that they’re working through, which I think, we’ve gone through most of it now and we’re anxiously just waiting for some more boards to test and to move into our customer’s hands.\\nUnidentified Analyst\\nThat was perfect. That’s good. I get some good color as to how things are looking. Thank you so much and I’ll jump back in the line here.\\nVictor Dellovo\\nHappy New Year.\\nGary Levine\\nThanks, Brett. Happy New Year.\\nUnidentified Analyst\\nThank you.\\nOperator\\n[Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Joseph Nerges with Segren Investing. Please go ahead.\\nJoseph Nerges\\nGood morning, guys. How are you doing?\\nVictor Dellovo\\nGood.\\nGary Levine\\nGood morning, Joe.\\nJoseph Nerges\\nA couple of quick – just a couple of quick ones. Why don’t you say the severance cost was that you charged off in the couple of severance payments that – from new paying people, you mentioned that, Gary, right?\\nGary Levine\\nYes, right. Yes, we had a number of people that we’re working with Germans and the UK, we’re working together. So they were working in the security area, which we basically with the sale we lost the engineers and a lot of them were salespeople and support people. So we lost a number of them go and then we realigned sort of the support staff in the UK, say that we can service our existing customer base, but cut back a number of people. So that’s what the severance cost worked for.\\nJoseph Nerges\\nYes, but what was the dollar amount for the quarter?\\nGary Levine\\nIt was, I think, about $150,000, Joe.\\nJoseph Nerges\\nSo that’s a one-time fourth quarter charge that…\\nGary Levine\\nRight.\\nJoseph Nerges\\n…included with the severance cost. And obviously, the supplier issues, we’re talking about – so we’re having no promise you are saying with the software for we could tell. Do we have some of the boards and not enough of the boards, so we’ve been able to internally test this, or do we – what seems to be drop…?\\nVictor Dellovo\\nYes. So, Joe, I’ll give you a little more color on that. What we’ve done is, we pushed the supplier as hard as we could to get these brand-new boards with the latest and greatest technology on the chipset. So that shift, which is just being released is something that we need, because we need the power to support all the software we’re loading on it.\\nSo what we did was, we get – they gave us a few board that were basically not even tested. We did a lot of the testing for them and then they had to really go back and make all the changes. We recently just got the next set of boards on hand and from what we can see everything is both being good. But there’s a bunch of other testing they need to do for them to certify it. So they could do it and send it out to the public that it’s GA for them, and that’s kind of where we’re at right now.\\nJoseph Nerges\\nOkay. So as far as we know the newest board looks pretty good and we’re just waiting for them assessing from the supplier standpoint and then the roll off. So we really don’t think we have a problem internally with the software at all my question has to be tested, I want to get this to the field. But basically, we’re – the biggest problem is getting the board?\\nVictor Dellovo\\nCorrect.\\nJoseph Nerges\\nJust a couple – one other quick question. From your website, it looks like you guys have expanded your managed service offerings quite a bit. My – is that incorrect that you added cloud services, you added backup services, these are things that [dig you] [ph]?\\n\\nVictor Dellovo\\nWhat is, Joe, what we did was, I think, we offered all of those what we did with our new website. I’m glad you looked at it was we’re trying to put it out this, so it was a little clearer to potentially new customers what our offerings were. So we just launched that probably less than 30 days ago with a clearer message of what the company looks like as – for the HPP side with the ARIA and all the products that go along with that and then we separated from the professional services and all the products that we sell, and then we kind of separated with the managed service offerings in a clear message of everything we can do so customers add. It’s just easy of understanding of what CSPi does or can do.\\nJoseph Nerges\\nWhat site is great? I mean, it really is very, very informative. And so, obviously, it highlights something that wasn’t as apparent before not exactly…\\nVictor Dellovo\\nExactly.\\nJoseph Nerges\\n…the question about the demand in service. By the way, you might check that, you put out an incorrect phone number on the conference call on your press release today. It’s 877 number. You got 876-9173 is the one that you put out on – the number you put out, which was the correct number you put out a week ago. And in today’s press release, it was 9193 is the last. So, I don’t know if anybody checked that, but that one is probably…\\nVictor Dellovo\\nObviously, yes. Okay, that’s my fault.\\nJoseph Nerges\\nOkay. I just – I thought the number, I look back and said if I was wrong, I have your old number. Okay. So basically there, and then R&D, like you said for the quarter, was like $925,000. So, obviously, a considerable amount of R&D versus what it was, like I said last year?\\nVictor Dellovo\\nYes. We were understaffed last year, Joe.\\nJoseph Nerges\\nOkay.\\nVictor Dellovo\\nAt that time, we had a lot of open positions.\\nJoseph Nerges\\nI understand. But what you’re basically doing is, obviously, we’re moving forward with – and the bulk of the R&D obviously is, I assume is the ARIA product line?\\nGary Levine\\nThat’s correct.\\nJoseph Nerges\\nAll right. Well, that’s what I’ve got. I’ll just – I’ll come back to what Brett said. Basically, when you look at the stock in a market like this get panicked, it comes in all the time in a market like an environment we’re having. So with the – by the way, with the cash balance at the end of the quarter, that’s what I forgot actually, the cash balance at the end of the year – fiscal year?\\nGary Levine\\nRight now?\\nJoseph Nerges\\nYes. It was all of it. In fiscal year, the September – your September 30 cash and equivalents – cash and cash equivalents?\\nGary Levine\\nIt’s like $25 million.\\nJoseph Nerges\\n$20 million, okay, $25 million. I didn’t look at in the 10-K and the press release didn’t have that. So it’s about $25 million at that point?\\nVictor Dellovo\\nYes, it’s a little over $25 million, yes.\\nJoseph Nerges\\nOkay, very good. Thank you very much. I appreciate the time you’re moving forward just if we can, we get everybody rolling the boat in the same direction with the suppliers here, I’m sure. Okay. I appreciate it.\\nVictor Dellovo\\nAbsolutely. Thanks, Joe. Happy New Year.\\nOperator\\n[Operator Instructions] And it appears, there are no further questions over the phone at this time.\\nVictor Dellovo\\nThank you all for joining us this evening – this morning. We look forward to speaking with you again on our next call.\\nOperator\\nThis does conclude today’s program. Thank you for your participation. You may disconnect at any time.\\nVictor Dellovo\\nThank you.']}\n"

The TSX Financial Index has lost 12.25% of its value over the past year. Even Canada’s Big Five have not been immune. In some cases, Canada’s Big Banks are trading at levels not seen since the financial crisis. Today however, I’d like to talk about goeasy Ltd (OTCPK:EHMEF)[TSX:GSY]. The company was unfairly punished this past quarter. Since reaching a 52-week high in August, goeasy’s share price has plummeted by more than 40 percent. It\\'s not uncommon for goeasy to see significant price swings, however, the most recent downturn is significantly overdone. The good news, investors now have a great opportunity to get a high-quality company for cheap. Stock is oversold For starters, goeasy has been in oversold territory the past couple weeks. Its 14-day relative strength index has been consistently below 30 since mid-December. As of this writing, its RSI is sitting at 29. As a general rule of thumb, a 14-day RSI below 30 indicates that the stock is oversold. As such, it\\'s due for an upward bounce. Follow the money Company insiders have been scooping up shares during the recent downtrend. All members of its senior team have purchased shares on the open market. The total value of the transactions was approximately $8.5 million for an average price of $39.93 per share. As of this writing, the stock is trading at a 22% discount to this average. Insiders have not sold shares on the open market this year. Not even when it was hitting highs above $50 a share. This exudes confidence. Management is as reliable as they come. The company has not missed guidance since 2011 and it has been posting record quarterly results. Bears will point the company’s high debt load. What they fail to understand is the company raises debt to fund the growth of its loan portfolio.\\n Organically, the company can fund annualized loan growth of approximately $150 million through internally generated cash flows. New debt and its recent equity offering will turbocharge the company’s growth. So long as the company continues to deliver, there\\'s no reason to be concerned about its high debt load. A top value stock At current valuations, goeasy is one of the best bargains on the Toronto Stock Exchange. The company is trading at 7.69 times forward earnings and a P/E to growth ratio of 0.25. This is one of the lowest PEG ratios on the Index. A PEG ratio under one signifies that the company’s share price is not keeping up with its expected growth rate. Take a quick look at the company’s F.A.S.T Graph as further evidence that the company’s recent downtrend is overdone. \\n\\n Once the company trades inline with its historical averages, investors are looking at 40% upside. Analysts are even more bullish. They expect the company to grow earnings by almost 53% in 2019. They all rate the company a \"‘buy\" and a have an average one-year price target of $60. This implies 93% upside from today’s share price. Triple threat If you can handle the volatility that comes with goeasy, the company is a strong buy at these levels. It\\'s a rare triple threat. The company offers investors value, growth and income. Over the past four years, goeasy has been raising its dividend at a torrid pace and it is on the verge of becoming a Canadian Dividend Aristocrat. This past year it raised dividends by 25% and I expect similar double-digit growth this coming year. At these levels, there\\'s not much not to like about the company. It has one of the best management teams in the sector and has met or beat estimates in every quarter this year. There\\'s no reason to expect any different moving forward.\\n If you would like to receive further articles on Canadian-based equities, please click the \"Follow\" text at the top of this page next to my profile.Disclosure: I am/we are long EHMEF.

December saw stable graphite prices and steady progress from the lithium miners. Syrah Resources had some great announcements including being on track to hit their 2018 production target, improving recoveries, and a new 48kt off-take agreement with Qingdao Langruite Graphite in 2019. Graphite spot and contract price news During December China graphite flake-194 EXW spot prices were flat, and are down 1.09% over the past year. \\n\\n Source: Northern Graphite (2018 price guide) Natural graphite large flake price history \\n\\nSource: Northern Graphite website (not recently updated, but graphite prices are little changed in 2018) In my January 30, 2018 Trend Investing Interview with Benchmark Minerals Simon Moores said about graphite: Spherical graphite anode plants, predominately based in China, were traditionally 5-10,000 tpa but now we are tacking four megafactories are looking to produce 60,000 to 100,000 tpa from 2020 onwards. Graphite market news A recent interview from The Assay of energy metals expert Chris Berry gives his views on graphite:\\n Unloved relative to lithium and cobalt, natural graphite suffers from the fact that there is a (higher cost) substitute in synthetic graphite, which can be, and is being, blended by anode manufacturers today to produce high purity product for the battery business. While there is a legitimate concern in the markets that the advent of solid state lithium ion batteries will become more prevalent and render graphite-based anodes obsolete, I think this fear is largely misplaced......For this year and the next, supply and demand for flake graphite appears generally balanced (allowing for surpluses in small flake and anode production capacity). China, which has historically accounted for 70% of graphite production, is currently rationalizing production capacity thanks to resource depletion and environmental concerns. The ‘pinch’ in graphite is yet to be felt, but I anticipate upward pricing pressure by 2020, breathing new life into non-Chinese natural graphite development companies. On December 20 Investing News reported: Graphite mining in the US key to national security interests. Late last year, President Trump issued an executive order for the development of a federal critical minerals strategy to reduce the risk posed by foreign dependence on 35 minerals. Graphite mining in the US is an area of vast potential as graphite is one of four critical minerals currently not produced within the country. The amount of graphite in a lithium-ion battery can be up to 15 times that of lithium. Tesla’s Roadster, for example, uses 110 kilograms of graphite per vehicle. Despite efforts to substitute out graphite from EV battery anodes, Roskill anticipates that natural flake and synthetic graphite consumption for battery applications could increase five to ten fold by 2027. There are two risks to graphite in the EV battery realm that should be taken into consideration. Firstly, material substitution in lithium-ion battery anodes. Secondly, arrival of technologies like the solid-state battery that are expected to compete with lithium-ion batteries. However, expected EV uptake in the coming decades and mass commercialization of solid-state batteries well into the next decade are positive for lithium-ion battery growth and graphite anodes that comprise them. Performance and cost factors are expected to keep lithium-ion batteries competitive for many years.\\n Graphite miner news Graphite producers I have not covered the following graphite producers as they are not accessible to most Western investors. They include - Aoyu Graphite Group, BTR New Energy Materials, Qingdao Black Dragon, National de Grafite.

December saw stable graphite prices and steady progress from the lithium miners. Syrah Resources had some great announcements including being on track to hit their 2018 production target, improving recoveries, and a new 48kt off-take agreement with Qingdao Langruite Graphite in 2019. Graphite spot and contract price news During December China graphite flake-194 EXW spot prices were flat, and are down 1.09% over the past year. \\n\\n Source: Northern Graphite (2018 price guide) Natural graphite large flake price history \\n\\nSource: Northern Graphite website (not recently updated, but graphite prices are little changed in 2018) In my January 30, 2018 Trend Investing Interview with Benchmark Minerals Simon Moores said about graphite: Spherical graphite anode plants, predominately based in China, were traditionally 5-10,000 tpa but now we are tacking four megafactories are looking to produce 60,000 to 100,000 tpa from 2020 onwards. Graphite market news A recent interview from The Assay of energy metals expert Chris Berry gives his views on graphite:\\n Unloved relative to lithium and cobalt, natural graphite suffers from the fact that there is a (higher cost) substitute in synthetic graphite, which can be, and is being, blended by anode manufacturers today to produce high purity product for the battery business. While there is a legitimate concern in the markets that the advent of solid state lithium ion batteries will become more prevalent and render graphite-based anodes obsolete, I think this fear is largely misplaced......For this year and the next, supply and demand for flake graphite appears generally balanced (allowing for surpluses in small flake and anode production capacity). China, which has historically accounted for 70% of graphite production, is currently rationalizing production capacity thanks to resource depletion and environmental concerns. The ‘pinch’ in graphite is yet to be felt, but I anticipate upward pricing pressure by 2020, breathing new life into non-Chinese natural graphite development companies. On December 20 Investing News reported: Graphite mining in the US key to national security interests. Late last year, President Trump issued an executive order for the development of a federal critical minerals strategy to reduce the risk posed by foreign dependence on 35 minerals. Graphite mining in the US is an area of vast potential as graphite is one of four critical minerals currently not produced within the country. The amount of graphite in a lithium-ion battery can be up to 15 times that of lithium. Tesla’s Roadster, for example, uses 110 kilograms of graphite per vehicle. Despite efforts to substitute out graphite from EV battery anodes, Roskill anticipates that natural flake and synthetic graphite consumption for battery applications could increase five to ten fold by 2027. There are two risks to graphite in the EV battery realm that should be taken into consideration. Firstly, material substitution in lithium-ion battery anodes. Secondly, arrival of technologies like the solid-state battery that are expected to compete with lithium-ion batteries. However, expected EV uptake in the coming decades and mass commercialization of solid-state batteries well into the next decade are positive for lithium-ion battery growth and graphite anodes that comprise them. Performance and cost factors are expected to keep lithium-ion batteries competitive for many years.\\n Graphite miner news Graphite producers I have not covered the following graphite producers as they are not accessible to most Western investors. They include - Aoyu Graphite Group, BTR New Energy Materials, Qingdao Black Dragon, National de Grafite.

In the worst case scenario, the dividend would be put at risk and the stock price in danger of serious declines, especially in the new bear market environment. Johnson & Johnson has been battling claims against its talc powder causing cancer in courts for years, with some success, as two months ago a jury overturned a verdict against J&J in New Jersey. That victory will not be enough though, as the issue is that J&J has about 11,700 similar plaintiffs across the United States. If taken to the mathematical extreme, these claims would destroy the company. It won’t be taken to the mathematical extreme, but just for the sake of putting this into perspective and taking recent verdicts into account, it would be $213M per litigant, multiplied by 11,700, which totals $2.5 trillion in liabilities. That would be rather ludicrous, and certainly any court would take into account J&J’s ability to pay any verdict while preserving its ability to function as a company in order to actually pay it. So J&J won’t go extinct because of its talc problem but that doesn’t mean the stock won’t have serious problems. \\n\\nJNJ data by YCharts\\n The story starts with J&J’s Baby Powder product, which is a talc powder that is applied to keep skin dry and help prevent diaper rash. The mines that talc is extracted from also have traces of asbestos, a known carcinogen. According to documents recently unearthed by Reuters, the company has known about this possibility since the 1970s. In J&J’s defense though, there were a myriad of tests done on the product throughout the decades and the vast majority of them showed that the product was safe and free of asbestos. Asbestos is a mineral that was used as an insulator that was added to cement, cloth, plastics, and other materials to make them stronger. It was later found that this product was toxic, causing a specific kind of cancer called mesothelioma, a cancer affecting the lining of the lungs. Over 80% of mesothelioma cases are caused by asbestos exposure. It is currently legal to have asbestos in American products, but only at very low levels of maximum 1%, and this might play in J&J’s favor on future verdicts. Other developed nations have banned asbestos completely. The talc powder has been linked, in these cases, to both ovarian cancer and mesothelioma. As a giant pharmaceutical company, it should come as no surprise that J&J has legal battles from time to time. Over the past five years, the company’s stock price has not reflected this risk and instead has kept up with the market shaking off these issues. The new cancer lawsuits were first reported in 2016, but the stock price movements did not reflect the development despite a Missouri judge ordering a payout of $4.69 billion to 22 women this past summer. Why was the stock complacent? Because J&J does prepare for possible lawsuits by creating a contingency fund to ensure that it accounts for potential lawsuits once amounts become identifiable and measured. Even $4.69 billion is not enough to make a long term dent in a company the size of J&J. It does intend to create a receivable (line item) on the balance sheet to account for pending amounts. In the case of the recent claims against the talc powder, the company noted in its September financial report that while it does not have an estimate, this lawsuit would be immaterial to its financial standing (page 32). In the meantime, it has started accruing for the legal cost of these appeals and disputes.\\n There have been cases where payouts ranged from $25.7M to $4.69B most recently. While this payout range is wide, the company is still in appeals with most of its rulings but currently, the balance sheet has about $16 billion in cash that it could use to pay out if needed. Bloomberg cited payouts could reach $20B for the lawsuits which would deplete cash reserves and be a little more serious. While these numbers are staggering it should be noted that these cash flow payouts would not come in a lump sum but over numerous quarters and years and could be met without seriously damaging J&J. J&J is a company that has a very nice dividend yield for its size of about 3%, and has had positive net income for the past five years. Currently, it has been using additional cash to pay down debt that was incurred over previous years, and it should be expected that this trend would be sustained for the foreseeable future. Debt to market cap is very small, less than 10% even taking into account the recent plunge in market cap, which means the balance sheet is nearly pristine. If the company needed to pay out additional cash, it could afford to do it based on profitability and excess cash flow. This insulates the dividend making it unnecessary to cut, for now. The contribution that the talc powder product specifically makes to the bottom line of the company is unknown but J&J’s revenue exposure to its consumer sector divisions is about 11%. The consumer products group only accounts for about 14% of total operating income (see 10Q linked above), which is not a substantial amount of revenue but is relevant and worth noting. While this news might be bad, especially the Reuters bombshell two weeks ago, it is still playing out. The key indicators would come when J&J starts to lose its appeals, more cases are filed on a consistent basis, or final amounts are dictated. The biggest concern should be if the government steps in because this could be considered a serious political risk to operations and financial viability. India for example has taken steps to stop production of the talc powder domestically until it is proven that there are no traces of asbestos within the product. During this timeframe, it has a material adverse impact to the sales/profitability of the consumer products division. While India might be an isolated incident, if other regions take this same approach, the financial impact becomes a severe impediment to business.\\n Overall this is a negative headwind that has the possibility of getting worse for J&J going forward. It is not only a financial risk but also is a big hit to its credibility. For a company that makes a significant amount of easy sales, the damage to credibility can cause many products in the consumer sector to lag and threaten profitability. In other words, if J&J starts to lose its appeals, consumers could start getting paranoid that any J&J product may contain asbestos or cause cancer, as irrational as this assumption may be. This would be a worst case scenario and would threaten the dividend payout that most investors have become accustomed to which would hurt stockholders and financial products that own the stock. Based on all the accumulated news and the brand new bear market we have just been sunk into, selling the stock at this time may not be a bad idea. For sellers though, long term call options on J&J would be a decent hedge to regain losses in case the lawsuits are overturned and the stock catapults back up. Even a bear environment will not be enough to hold the stock down if the talc powder product is cleared and J&J wins its appeals. For those that still have faith in the prospects of the company winning these cases, you could hedge your position with puts to limit the downside impact if a worst case scenario arises.\\nDisclosure: I/we have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

The fund is trading at one of the widest discounts we have seen in years. The 1-year z-score is a whopping -2.60, which isn\\'t typically seen in one of the more popular funds here on Seeking Alpha. The fund is also very close to a 10% yield (9.80%,) which is very attractive for income oriented investors. There is the very real potential of PCI trading back towards its NAV. The discount currently stands at a 9.91% discount, this is partly due to the wild December the broader market has experienced. The fund NAV is still showing a positive return of 4.37% YTD, while the market return is showing a loss of 0.98%. The wild market has given us an opportunity that is even better reflected in the last 3-month performance. The last 3-month NAV return is showing a loss of 2.82%, this is where the opportunity is, as the market price has dropped a tremendous 14.14%! About The Fund PCI is quite a large fund at total managed assets of $5,705.912 million, according to CEFconnect. The fund utilizes leverage of $2,489 million or 43.31%, this is primarily comprised of reverse repurchase agreements as stated on the fund\\'s website. The fund describes their approach as \"normally invest at least 80% of its net assets in a portfolio of mortgage-related securities and other debt instruments of varying maturities. The fund will normally invest at least 25% of its total assets in privately issued mortgage-related securities.\" They continue with \"may also invest up to 40% of its total assets in securities of issuers economically tied to emerging market countries. The fund will normally maintain an average portfolio duration of between zero and eight years.\"\\n This gives them the categorization as a fixed income or multi sector asset class. The managers have quite the flexibility to invest where, when, and how they want. They have so far successfully managed the fund, this has further backed up that a Pimco fund is the right place to be for fixed income exposure. This fund has been able to continue that persona of Pimco. The fees may give some investors pause as the total expense ratio when leverage is excluded is 2.10%, and when the interest expense is included the total expense ratio comes to a grand total of 4.20%. This is considerable compared to other funds but they know that investors will pay up for performance and as long as they are able to continue the success, this shouldn\\'t be seen as a problem. The interest expense for the reverse repurchase agreements portion of their leverage is stated at a weighted average interest rate of 2.394%, so if the team is able to produce returns above this rate the leverage could be considered as successful. Taking it further, the 2.10% fee is high, this is especially true for the size of the fund. But even so they have still been able to provide a since inception total NAV return of 9.21% and market return of 7.06%. The fund has an inception date of January 29, 2013. This is considerable as the fund has taken a beating along with the market recently and factoring in the high expenses. \\n\\nSource - PCI Fund Website Performance PCI currently trades at a NAV of $22.29 per share on 12/24/2018 and has a market price of $20.08. This gives the fund a steep discount of 9.91% and even better, the find has a 1-year z-score of -2.60. PCI hasn\\'t traded at this wide of a discount for years. \\n\\nSource - CEFconnect\\n The last time the fund traded at this deep of a discount was towards the end of 2016, and I don\\'t expect this discount to persist going forward. While the fund had previously traded at wide discounts for most of its existence. This appears to have changed when the fund changed strategies announced on June 29, 2016. This put PCI in a closer investment policy as Pimco\\'s slightly more successful fund, Pimco Dynamic Income Fund (PDI). The funds have been trading more in-line since the announcement became effective. I am focusing more on PCI rather than PDI here because of wide discount that is showing in PCI. While historically PDI is also trading at a wide discount it is still ever so slightly at a premium. Although basically non-existent at a premium of 0.04%, but still not as attractive as the almost 10% discount shown in PCI. And when the funds are so similar, I would choose PCI as having the most upside potential at this point. This isn\\'t to say that I don\\'t like PDI or that it won\\'t perform going forward, I just expect PCI to be a better buy at this time. Distribution PCI has quite the attractive distribution currently at a 9.80% rate, this is paid out monthly at an amount of $0.1641 per share. For even more of a positive the latest UNII report available for all the Pimco funds is showing PCI having a very high coverage ratio fiscal YTD at 120.90%. The fiscal year end for PCI is June 30th. \\n\\nSource - Pimco UNII Report This shows promise that PCI has been able to cover its distribution well, meaning the fund hasn\\'t had to distribute out any destructive return of capital. The income the fund has produced has been sufficient. Again, PDI may be seen as the higher quality fund as the fund shows a higher coverage ratio, but as long as the distribution is being covered is the important factor. This is especially important in a fixed income fund that the distribution is covered with net investment income. This is can be compared to an equity funds that doesn\\'t rely on having a positive NII or UNII because the funds can utilize capital gains that aren\\'t classified as NII when making distributions.\\n PCI has been able to raise the distribution once since inception. The inception monthly distribution was at $0.1563 per share, while the current rate of $0.1641 has been maintained since that raise starting with the October 2015 distribution. We have also been fortunate to have just recently received a special distribution of $0.35 per share for those of us that held shares on an ex date of 12/14/2018, payable 12/21/18. The fund has a history of paying out special distributions in all years since inception except for 2017. I view this as a conservative way of the fund distributing out what it needs to in order to comply with the laws and rules for operating as a CEF. By PCI not going and raising the distribution in order to appear more attractive and instead doing annual distributions, this lowers the chance the fund will have to cut the distribution at some point in the future. \\n\\nSource - CEFconnect Summary Pimco is a very popular and highly regarded fund sponsor and I believe PCI is flashing a very strong buy signal. The uncertainties in the overall market shouldn\\'t be disregarded but with the current factors present in PCI, I do believe now is an attractive time to potentially start a position. This may be too soon to call, but I don\\'t try and time the market, I see the current opportunity in PCI, and I think it should be taken. The fund showing one of its widest discounts in years, high distribution coverage, and higher than typical yield thanks to the sell-off make this fund a long-term winner in my book.\\nDisclosure: I am/we are long PCI.

AT&T closed the Time Warner acquisition in 2018 (well, sort of) and its management team has consistently provided a bullish outlook but, at the end of the day, the market is not yet sold on what Mr. Randall Stephenson, CEO, and team are selling. \\n\\nT data by YCharts AT&T\\'s stock has been a consistent underperformer (i.e., the 1-, 3-, and 5-year stock performance is nothing to write home about) but, in my opinion, there are reasons to be optimistic about what 2019 may bring for this large company. There are a few things that need to fall into place - finalize the Time Warner deal, an efficient & effective 5G rollout, and get some \"wins\" in the streaming space - but I believe that there are two main metrics that have a material impact on the investment thesis. AT&T is (and has been) viewed as an income play, so investors should mostly be concerned about the sustainability of the dividend; therefore, I believe that investors will need to keep a close eye on the two metrics that really matter right now: (1) free cash flow metrics and (2) financial leverage. Free Cash Flow (\"FCF\"), The Dividend Is Safe To start, I believe that AT&T has the capacity to support its rich [and growing] dividend for the foreseeable future, but that does not mean that it will be smooth sailing over the next 12-18 months. Market sentiment has the real potential to wreak serious havoc if AT&T fails to manage the story - that is, fears/concerns can play a more significant role than the actual fundamentals when it comes to the performance of the stock. The stock performance over the last two years is a good case in point.\\n For a capital-intensive business like AT&T, I believe that investors should focus more on FCF than earnings when it comes to evaluating the dividend. As such, the following table should come as welcome news.       $ - in millions Nine-Month Period         30-Sept.-18 30-Sept.-17 Chg % Chg   Net cash provided by operating activities $31,522 $28,473 $3,049 11%   Less: Capital expenditures (17,099) (16,474) (625) 4%   Free Cash Flow 14,423 11,999 2,424 20%               Less: dividends paid (9,775) (9,030) (745) 8%   Free Cash Flow after dividends $4,648 $2,969 $1,679 57%   Free Cash Flow Dividend Payout Ratio 67.8% 75.3% -7% -10%   Source: Data from Supplemental Q3 2018 Report; table created by author. Make no mistake about it, AT&T\\'s FCF metrics are improving and not deteriorating like some pundits would have you believe. Moreover, as we look ahead, it is important to note that management is guiding for the FCF metrics to further improve over the next 12 months. \\n\\n Source: Investor Event, November 2018 The dividend payout ratio has not been in the 50s percent for quite some time, so this is definitely encouraging news. Additionally, FCF is projected to be in the $26B range, which is a significant increase from the $18B that was reported for fiscal 2017. Let\\'s not forget that these results also factor in the ramp in CapEx that is expected for 2019. In conclusion, AT&T\\'s dividend is not only safe but this company also has the capacity to grow its payout ratio in the years ahead. However, I believe that management should not increase the dividend beyond the token 2% annual raise but, instead, should focus on improving the other metric that matters right now - the company\\'s growing debt balance, i.e., financial leverage.\\n Financial Leverage, The Growing Debt Balance An investment in AT&T does not come without its risks. This company obviously operates in a highly capital-intensive industry, so AT&T typically carries a very high debt balance, which adds risk to the story. The DirecTV and Time Warner acquisitions greatly increased AT&T\\'s financial leverage, as the company had to take on a significant amount of debt to close both deals. \\n\\n Source: 2017 10-K The percentage change in the debt balance says it all. \\n\\nT Financial Debt (Quarterly) data by YCharts Debt is up big over the last three years, but as management has reaffirmed on several different occasions, this company has the cash flows to properly manage/service its liabilities. \\n\\nT Current Ratio (Quarterly) data by YCharts Plus, there are two important points to consider: (1) the company has plans to retire or refinance a large portion of its debt in the near term and (2) the majority of the debt has fixed rates. \\n\\n\\n Source: Q3 2018 Earnings Presentation Lastly, in addition to returning to a historical adjusted EBITDA-to-net debt ratio by 2022, management expects for the ratio to be at a more reasonable level by the end of 2019 (approximately 2.5x). Simply put, AT&T\\'s financial leverage is a risk factor, but I do not believe that it is a significant concern. I definitely plan to monitor the progress that management makes through 2019 but, in my opinion, the company\\'s financial leverage should not cause investors to jump ship at this point in time. Valuation AT&T\\'s stock is trading at a steep discount when compared to its closest competitor, Verizon (VZ). \\n\\nT Price to Free Cash Flow (TTM) data by YCharts Moreover, T shares are trading at an attractive valuation when compared to its own historical metrics. \\n\\nT PE Ratio (TTM) data by YCharts There are risks to AT&T\\'s story but, in my opinion, the stock is currently oversold - the risks are more than priced into the stock at today\\'s price. For example, AT&T\\'s stock would be at the $35 level if shares were trading at 10x 2019E earnings (based on estimates per Yahoo! Finance). In my opinion, the stock would still be cheap at $35 per share. Risks The two metrics mentioned above (i.e., cash flows & financial leverage) are the most significant risk factors that need to be considered. If the cash flow metrics fail to impress in 2019, or if the leverage targets are not achieved, AT&T\\'s stock will likely face major downward pressure.\\n Additionally, investors should closely monitor the progress that is made with incorporating the newly acquired Time Warner assets with the legacy businesses in the quarters ahead. Integration risk could potentially impact the stock in a material way over the next few years if investors are not sold on the long-term business prospects of the newly acquired assets, i.e., similar to the way that the DirecTV acquisition is viewed today. Bottom Line While there are plenty of concerns when it comes to AT&T business model and management\\'s strategy, I believe that this telecom company has great long-term business prospects - e.g., 5G rollout, international operations, and in the streaming space (including leveraging the newly acquired assets/content). Additionally, the Street is getting more bullish by the day (see here and here for recent upgrades for T shares) and I fully expect for more professionals to jump on the train in 2019. Today, AT&T should still be viewed as a large defensive telecom company that pays a safe [and growing] dividend but, in my opinion, this narrative could turn on a dime with the changes that are occurring in the wireless and entertainment industries. However, at the end of the day, I believe that AT&T\\'s stock will go as the two metrics - cash flows and financial leverage - go over the next 12-18 months. As such, the improving free cash flow prospects, coupled with the company\\'s manageable financial leverage position, make the stock a long-term buy at today\\'s price.

Looking ahead to 2019, I wanted to identify companies that I believe are oversold and have a better margin of safety going forward. Since I'm expecting a volatile 2019, once I identify an oversold company, I purchase the common shares and immediately sell a covered call that is 10-15% out of the money to reduce my cost basis. This strategy has served me well in 2018 and I expect similar results next year. The general criteria I used for selection is  Large market cap ($25 Billion+) Low (Under 12) forward P/E 3%+ dividend yield Shares significantly lower (25%+) in the past 6 months Already announced plans to buy back shares in 2019  The two companies I identify below represent compelling opportunities in two sectors that have suffered significant declines in the past 3 months. \\n\\n Phillips 66 Current Price: $84.20 52 Week High Price: $123.97 Market Cap: $36.2B Forward P/E: 8.7X Yield: 3.8% Phillips 66 (PSX) has declined 32% from highs earlier this year, suffering along with everything else in the energy sector. PSX has seen its share price go back to 2014 levels, despite reducing its outstanding share count 18%, increasing its dividend from $1.89 to $3.10, and seeing its tax rate fall significantly over that time period. PSX's largest business is refining and its share price has followed crude oil lower this quarter. However, refining margins are not directly tied to the price of crude but the ratio of crude oil to refined product prices. This ratio is referred to as a crack spread. While refining margins have declined in Q4, this can be attributed to primarily to seasonality in gasoline demand.\\n \\n\\n Crude oil volatility is not new to the refining business and has happened many times in the past. From 2014-2016, crude dropped significantly but PSX's share price remained stable throughout this period. \\n\\nPSX is also highly diversified and less than have of its revenues are from refining, with Midstream, Chemicals, and Specialty comprising 52% of earnings in the past 9 months. They continue to invest in pipelines and other more stable, fee based business. They are sticking to their previous guidance to reinvest 60% of earnings back into the business and distribute 40% back to shareholders. Besides the dividend, they are guiding to $1-2 billion for share repurchases in 2019. The midpoint of this guidance would repurchase 4% of the outstanding shares at current prices. I think this is a mispricing for this great company and the shares rebound next year. For those worried about further energy sector weakness or general market volatility, I recommend the following for a conservative play  Buy PSX at $84 Immediately sell Jan 17 2020 Calls @ 95 for $6.20 Net Cost: $77.80  Note: PSX pays a 80 cent quarterly dividend Break even price: $74.60 (11% below current price.) Return if stock stays at $84: 12.6% Return if stock called at $95: 27.3% 2. Citigroup Current Price: $51.25 52 Week High: $80.70 Market Cap: $125 Billion Forward P/E: 6.8x Yield: 3.5% There are many reasons the big banks are unpopular right now: Recession worries, a weakening housing market, yield curve flattening, and weak trading results. These are real concerns that could impact 2019 results. Do I believe these reasons merit a 29% drop for Citigroup (C) in the past 12 weeks? Absolutely not!\\n \\n\\n Citigroup (C) has improved most of its operating metrics in the past few years and has guided to further improvements in 2019 and 2020. Even if these improvements do not materialize as planned, the recent decline in share price has been so extreme that investing at the current price should still generate a positive return. \\n\\n Citiigroup trades at a large discount in Price to Tangible Book Value versus the other major banks. While I believe some discount may be appropriate, the magnitude of this discount is extreme and I don't believe it is merited. Note that the current 0.835 Price / TBV is somewhat misleading versus the historical values since the jump at the beginning of 2018 was a result of the tax reform and subsequent reduction in the value of Citigroup's deferred tax assets. Without this, by this metric, Citigroup would be as cheap as it was in early 2016, right before it doubled over the next 18 months. The timing of this price dislocation is somewhat fortunate because Citigroup is in the middle of a large capital return and at the current share price, can repurchase 15% of the outstanding shares with the currently committed $19 billion. Citigroup CFO John Gerspach discussed this at the Goldman Sachs US Financial Services Conference 2018 on December 5th    The first thing is we're still committed to hitting the $60 billion that we said we would do over a three -- we're $41 billion into that right now. So $19 billion to go. So that's priority number one. Once we think about how to return that capital, I think that you've seen us move our dividend significantly over the last couple of years to get to the point where we're more or less in line with our peers and we'll continue that process. We want to stay at a healthy dividend rate because we do know that there is a class of investors that value dividends, but as long as the stock is trading below book value, as it currently is, I think that you have to lean somewhat heavily toward stock buybacks. \\n Citigroup is guiding to buying back shares at this level of discount if it is available before increasing dividend payments. At such a discount, it provides a significant boost to earnings per share and book value per share, and I believe the magnitude of the buyback should be supportive of the stock price in 2019. For those that want to play Citigroup conservatively, I recommend the following  Buy C at $51.25 Immediately sell Jan 17 2020 Calls @ 57.5 for $4.20 Net Cost: $47.05  Note: C pays a 45 cent quarterly dividend Break even price: $45.44 (12% below current price.) Return if stock stays at $51.25: 12.8% Return if stock called at $57.50: 26%  Conclusion I believe both of these companies have upside over the next year. Both are quality businesses that are reinvesting in themselves through improved operations and share repurchases. Selling covered calls on these shares, combined with how far the share prices have already fallen, I believe will provide a reasonable margin of safety against broader market declines in 2019 while still offering compelling upside.\\nDisclosure: I am/we are long PSX, C.

Producers exchange their goods for money and then exchange money for other goods. As production of goods and services increases, this results in a greater demand for the services of the medium of exchange (the service that money provides). Conversely, as economic activity slows down, the demand for the services of money follows suit. The demand for the services of the medium of exchange is also affected by changes in prices. An increase in the prices of goods and services leads to an increase in the demand for the medium of exchange. People now demand more money to facilitate more expensive goods and services. A fall in the prices of goods and services results in a decline in the demand for the medium of exchange. Now, take the example where an increase in the supply of money for a given state of economic activity has taken place. Since there was not any change in the demand for the services of the medium of exchange, this means that people now have a surplus of money or an increase in monetary liquidity. Obviously, no individual wants to hold more money than is required. An individual can get rid of surplus cash by exchanging the money for goods. Individuals as a group, however, cannot get rid of the surplus of money just like that. They can only shift money from one individual to another individual. The mechanism that generates the elimination of the surplus of cash is the increase in the prices of goods. Once individuals start to employ the surplus cash in acquiring goods, this pushes prices higher. As a result, the demand for the services of money increases. All this in turn works towards the elimination of the monetary surplus. Once money enters a particular market, this means that more money is now paid for a product in that market. Alternatively, we can say that the price of a good in this market has now gone up. (Note that a price is the number of dollars per unit of something).\\n Observe that what has triggered increases in the prices of goods in various markets is the increase in the monetary surplus or monetary liquidity in response to the increase in the money supply. While increases in the money supply result in a monetary surplus, a fall in the money supply for a given level of economic activity leads to a monetary deficit. Individuals still demand the same amount of the services from the medium of exchange. To accommodate this, they will start selling goods, thus pushing their prices down. At lower prices, the demand for the services of the medium of exchange declines, and this in turn works towards the elimination of the monetary deficit. A change in liquidity, or the monetary surplus, can also take place in response to changes in economic activity and changes in prices. For instance, an increase in liquidity can emerge for a given stock of money and a decline in economic activity. A fall in economic activity results in fewer goods produced. This means that less goods are going to be exchanged - implying a decline in the demand for the services of money - the services of the medium of exchange. Once a surplus of money emerges, it produces exactly the same outcome with respect to the prices of goods and services as the increase in money supply does. That is, it pushes prices higher. An increase in prices in turn works towards the elimination of the surplus of money - the elimination of monetary liquidity. Conversely, an increase in economic activity, while the stock of money stays unchanged, produces a monetary deficit. This in turn sets in motion the selling of goods thereby depressing their prices. The fall in prices in turn works towards the elimination of the monetary deficit. A Time Lag Between Monetary Surpluses and Price Increases There is a time lag between changes in liquidity (i.e. a monetary surplus) and changes in asset prices such as the prices of stocks. (The reason for the lag is because when money is injected it does not affect all individuals and hence all markets instantly. There are earlier and later recipients of money).\\n For instance, there could be a long time lag between the peak in liquidity and the peak in the stock market. This means that the effect of the previously rising liquidity can continue to overshadow the effect of currently declining liquidity for some period. Hence, the peak in the stock market emerges once declining liquidity starts to dominate the scene. Exploring How Changes in Liquidity have Historically Driven the Stock Market The yearly growth rate of liquidity topped in November 1927 at 10.2% - after a time lag of 22 months, the S&P 500 responded by peaking in August 1929 at 31.71. (Note liquidity is the yearly % changes in AMS (i.e., a measure of money supply) minus yearly % changes in the CPI and industrial production). In 1987, the time lag between a peak in liquidity and a peak in the stock market was much shorter - the yearly growth rate of liquidity topped in January 1987 at 15.1%. The S&P 500 responded to this by peaking eight months later at 329.9 by August of that year. \\n\\n According to historical data, the yearly growth rate of liquidity bottomed at minus 16.6% in May 1929. Yet it took a long time before the S&P 500 responded to this. It took over three years after the bottom in liquidity was reached before the S&P 500 started to recover. The stock price index bottomed in June 1932 at 4.43. The time lag between the bottom in liquidity and the bottom in the stock market has been however shorter in recent history. The yearly growth rate of liquidity had bottomed at minus 5.4% in September 2000. It took twenty-five months before the S&P 500 bottomed at 815.28 by September 2002. \\n\\n\\n In May 1975, the yearly growth rate of our monetary measure, AMS stood at 4.5%. The yearly growth rate of the consumer price index stood at 9.5%, while the yearly growth rate of industrial production closed at minus 12.4%. As a result, our measure of liquidity stood at 7.4%. In response to this, the S&P 500 peaked at 107.5 by December 1976. Now, our measure of liquidity hit bottom at minus 10.5% in May 1976. In response to this, the S&P 500 reached its bottom at 87.04 in February 1978 - a fall of 19% from the peak. \\n\\n The S&P 500 closed at 1,549.38 in October 2007 before a large decline took place bringing the stock index to 735.1 by February 2009 - a fall of 52.3%. The yearly growth rate of liquidity peaked at 6.1% by June 2003 (see chart). The bottom in the stock price index at 735.1 reached by February 2009 well after a bottom in liquidity at minus 5.9% took place in November 2007. \\n\\n Where is the S&P 500 heading? Our measure of liquidity has peaked at 16.3% in October 2016. Thereafter, it fell to minus 4.5% by November 2017. This we suggest poses a threat to the S&P 500. It is quite likely that the stock price index has peaked in September 2018 at 2,914. \\n\\n\\n Disclosure: No positions\\n']}\n"

The company gave a timeline of 12 to 18 months in June of 2018 which would lead to a possible IPO between June to December 2019. Now that the process has started, is it worth buying the IPO? What about GE itself after the spinoff? Here are things to consider. Under GE, the healthcare business line has actually been profitable with growth rates in the single-digit range of 4.5% in 2017 and 3.6% in 2016. This might not seem all that exciting, but the key is that GE has been having success in emerging markets which is a good sign because these countries have higher GDP growth rates than the developed nations such as the United States. The healthcare business unit accounts for about 15% of the total revenue for GE but contributes about 27% of the positive operating income generated. Meanwhile, GE has a host of businesses that it\\'s discontinuing which are operating at a loss, making them non-viable entities. So why spin off the healthcare division? In order to generate much-needed cash along with the company shedding business lines which do not have above average revenue growth. It needs to pay off debt, and fast, before interest rates rise substantially. The healthcare industry which this business unit competes in is dominated by McKesson (MCK), UnitedHealth Group (UNH), Amerisource Bergen (ABC), Cardinal Health (CAH) and CVS Corp (CVS) which are the top five players making up about 25% of revenues in a $3.31 trillion-dollar market. The GE Healthcare unit only makes up only 0.57% of those revenues which serves as a potential growth opportunity for the spin-off if it can grab more market share.\\n As of Sept. 30, revenues were flat from the previous quarter for the unit while profit was up 2%, driven by cost reduction due to increasing digital automation, logistical changes, restructuring, and higher volumes. Year over year, revenues are up 5% with profits up 8%, indicating higher efficiency, a good sign going forward. There\\'s a pricing headwind that the company is experiencing, but this is somewhat reflected in its single-digit growth range and is typical for a mature industry. When GE spins off this company, the new entity will probably be profitable from day one, but it will be a smaller cap name which might inhibit its ability to borrow capital at reasonable rates. As of last December, the unit had about $3.448B in operating income which derived from $19.1B in revenue for an 18% operating profit. While none of the top five businesses mentioned above are exactly alike, Cardinal Health can be used as a proxy because it provides a conservative expectation for what the company might look like after being spun off.\\n\\n Yahoo Finance Return wise over the past two years both GE and Cardinal have struggled, with these companies posting returns of -78% and -40%, respectively, during this timeframe. While this looks bad, Cardinal Health is still one of the top five companies in the healthcare distribution industry, and other than UnitedHealth the other top companies have had lackluster stock returns during the past two years as well. Cardinal Health has been profitable for the past couple of years and its growth rate resembles one of a mature company in a mature industry with an expected growth rate of 5%. The profit margins for the GE spin-off might be better, estimated to be about 18% in the current structure, while Cardinal has a current operating income margin of only 2.6%. This of course is pending the debt load and pension expense the new company might take from GE’s books, which is part of the point, since GE cannot keep its current debt load and survive. None of the top five have double-digit profit margins, but UnitedHealth Group stands out from this group because it has long-term growth of around 12%. For investors looking for an alternative to UnitedHealth Group with lower growth but a quality balance sheet, this spin-off might be a viable option.\\n For GE, this event creates a source of cash that the company can use to pay off debt, but the negative obviously is that they will spin off their second-highest revenue-generating business unit, making it even harder to pay back the debt that remains. Despite spinning off the healthcare unit, GE still has the legacy headache, GE Capital. This group is a significant problem for GE because it has the most amount of assets, but the business unit is the biggest drag on the firms’ financial resources with significant losses during the past three calendar years. On a pre-tax basis, the income from the aviation department which is the highest revenue generating business unit for GE was offset by the losses from GE Capital during 2017. While the spin-off will help to boost the growth rate of the firm and possibly firm valuation/market value, GE will not be solving all of its problems in one fell swoop by far, but instead will only be kicking the can down the road. This momentary boost is positive for the firm, but it will probably not be enough to boost their dividend nor make it sustainable. As a spin-off, the GE Healthcare unit can be a viable standalone company, but timing does not look to be on its side. Doing an IPO at the tail end of this 10-year bull run that\\'s arguably already over could be a significant hindrance for its stock price. Almost all major domestic US indices are in bear market territory and it\\'s increasingly likely that we are headed toward a recession, possible even at the very time that the IPO officially happens. The IPO market is binary with more misses than hits, and unfortunately GE will be doing this spin-off facing market headwinds that will be against it. While the company should be viable, buying it once it goes public might not be a wise option, but it\\'s a \"watch and wait\" because returns are highly likely to struggle out the gate due to the management team getting accustomed to managing market expectations and the current turbulent market environment.\\n Disclosure: I/we have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

Shares were down to just $16 late last year but staged an epic rally to $41 this summer on optimism about the company’s turnaround efforts. However, general market weakness and pessimism on the retailers as a group has led Macy’s shares to $30 once again. While I’m certainly not overly bullish about the company’s growth prospects, I do think Macy’s deserves a look from the long side based up on valuation and yield alone. It looks to me like investors have gone too far to the downside and for those seeking yield in particular, one can do much worse. \\n\\n Recent results are better than the share price indicates The company’s recent results have been pretty good of late and while investors certainly hope for better than “pretty good”, in this case, that will do just fine. Investors have become so down on Macy’s that anything besides a total disaster should send the stock higher over time, and certainly, Macy’s has been far from a disaster this year.\\n Comparable sales continue to rise, having added 3.3% in Q3 and 2.7% thus far this year. Macy’s, at times, has struggled with comparable sales but clearly, the company’s merchandising strategy is working, and consumers are responding. Its mix of private label merchandise, an assortment which is huge at this point, is helping to drive traffic to the stores. In addition, Macy’s is focused on building out its ecommerce platform and fulfillment capabilities, an initiative that is expensive to be sure, but well worth it should it work. Management is also trying to drive traffic to the stores via long-term initiatives around more localized merchandise assortments, refreshing outdated stores and even leasing excess space at its bigger locations. All of these things point to a management team that knows there is a problem and is willing and able to fix it. Indeed, I’d argue that a nearly 3% comparable sales number for this year thus far points to early success. Margins continue to be a concern, even if comparable sales are performing well, as Macy’s is struggling with operating and support costs. Gross margins were flat in Q3 at ~40% of revenue, which is a bit low for an apparel-focused retailer. Macy’s certainly sells many items that aren’t apparel so its margin profile won’t look like a pure-play apparel shop, but still, 40% gross margins is a tough way to make a living as a retailer. This is even more so the case with Macy’s bloated SG&A costs, which have crested 41% of revenue for this year. Those keeping score at home will certainly notice that with SG&A costs coming in higher than gross margins, operating margins will be negative. They have been this year except that credit card revenue and gains on the sale of real estate have helped save the day, and produce operating margins that are slightly above zero. However, on a true operating basis where we just look at gross margins and SG&A costs, Macy’s is in the red for the first three quarters of the year. Long-term focus from management\\n Macy’s has always had a lot of debt but has worked in recent quarters to whittle it down. At the end of Q3, it had $5.5 billion in long-term debt on the balance sheet in addition to $2.8 billion in other long-term liabilities and $6.4 billion in short-term liabilities. That’s a lot but to its credit, Macy’s has worked through some of it by deploying excess cash to debt repayment and shareholders’ equity has increased $1.4 billion in the past four quarters alone. The company recently tendered for several hundred million dollars of debt subsequent to the end of Q3, so its liabilities will be even lower when it reports for Q4. This is a meaningful benefit for shareholders as Macy’s is deploying cash from earnings and asset sales to reduce its significant leverage for the future. A very cheap valuation, even on lower earnings Analysts have Macy’s earning $3.63 next year, which would be down from a forecast $4.23 in the current fiscal year. At today’s price, that would put Macy’s forward price-to-earnings ratio at just 8.3, which compares very favorably to the company’s longer-term average, which is around 12. Even if we assume just a PE of 10 for the nearer term, that’s roughly $6 on the share price, or ~20% higher from here. I think Macy’s deserves to trade at 12 or higher again eventually, but it will need to prove its staying power with earnings growth. To be fair, that is something it is quite a long way from doing as of now. In addition to the stock being quite cheap, the yield is absolutely huge. The stock is yielding right at 5% today and given that the dividend is only about 40% of next year’s forecast earnings, the payout is very safe and has room for comfortable growth in the future. Indeed, I think the fact that Macy’s is paying down so much of its debt is paving the way for more sizable future dividend increases, but that remains to be seen. Even if I’m wrong, the current yield is enormous and very safe, meaning that shareholders get to enjoy a yield that is nearly two times that of the 10-year Treasury while the turnaround progresses. And with a very low valuation, risk seems to the upside rather than the downside.\\n Macy’s certainly isn’t perfect and there is no light at the end of the tunnel when it comes to earnings growth. However, the pieces are in place for the company to deleverage, continue to grow comparable sales and improve profitability in the future, all while paying shareholders a 5% dividend. If you’re looking for a value-oriented income stock, you can do much worse than Macy’s and as a result, I think it is a buy.\\nDisclosure: I/we have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

Master Limited Partnerships, or MLPs, have had a couple of rough years, and we have been exposing ourselves to them through the related CEFs every now and then, as avid followers would have noticed from our articles. This group has now become part of our Weekly Reviews, so we can keep an eye on them in a more consistent manner and share our thoughts with you. The News \\n\\n Source: Author\\'s Software Over the past week, several closed-end funds declared their regular distributions:  Kayne Anderson Midstream/Energy Fund, Inc. (NYSE:KMF) (the \"Fund\") announced today its monthly distributions of $0.075 per share for each of January, February, and March 2019. This distribution is a reduction of $0.025 per share from the prior rate of $0.10 per share. Kayne Anderson MLP/Midstream Investment Company (NYSE:KYN) (the \"Company\") announced today its monthly distributions of $0.12 per share for each of January, February, and March 2019. This distribution is a reduction of $0.03 per share from the prior rate of $0.15 per share.  \\n\\n\\n Source: finance.yahoo.com The Benchmark Over the past week, the ALPS Alerian MLP ETF (AMLP) finished in negative territory. On Friday, the ETF hit a new low over this time frame of $8.64 per share. On a weekly basis, AMLP lost $0.37 per share to its price. \\n\\n Source: Barchart.com - AMLP Daily Chart (6 months) The US Oil Fund (USO) hit a new low on the last trading day as well. The oil benchmark finished the trading week at a price of $9.52 per share. On a weekly basis, the ETF has lost $1.31 per share. \\n\\n Source: Barchart.com - USO Daily Chart (6 months) 1. Highest Z-Score \\n\\n Source: CEFConnect.com Today, we have a closed-end fund with a positive Z-score. The Cushing Energy Income Fund (SRF) has a modest result of 0.50 points. Despite its positive score, we cannot say that the CEF is overvalued because its score has to be over 1.00. Next in line is the Fiduciary/Claymore Energy Infrastructure Fund (FMO) with a negative score of -1.00. The fund is undervalued not only from a statistical perspective. Currently, FMO is trading at -6.77% discount. At our previous update, the fund had lower results than today.\\n The Goldman Sachs MLP and Energy Renaissance Fund (GER) is still with the lowest Z-score among the highest ones. GER has a score of -2.00 and trades at a -13.40% discount. 2. Lowest Z-Score \\n\\n Source: CEFConnect.com At the very bottom of the table, we find ClearBridge Energy Midstream Opportunity Fund (EMO). Its Z-score today is -3.10 - the lowest in the sector. Over the past week, EMO made a new low over this time frame: \\n\\n Source: barchart.com - EMO Daily Chart (6 months) Its trading volume was quite above its average one during the past couple of days. EMO is followed by the Cohen & Steers MLP Income and Energy Opportunity Fund (MIE) which currently has the second lowest Z-score in the sector - -2.80. At our last update, MIE was ranked fifth with a score of -2.40 and a discount of -11.88%. Today, the energy fund has reached new 52-week lows as shown below: \\n\\n Source: CEFConnect.com Despite its sharp NAV drop, the CEF has announced its regular distribution without any change in the amount of the dividend:\\n\\n\\n Source: CEFConnect.com 3. 5-Year Annualized Return On NAV \\n\\n Source: CEFConnect.com The aim of the above ranking is to show us the closed-end funds with higher yields based on net asset value.

Highest Premium \\n\\n Source: CEFConnect.com There is still a lack of premiums in the sector. Despite that, I decided to show you the \\'highest\\' discounts in the group. The MLP CEF with the most tighten NAV/Price spread is the First Trust Energy Income & Growth Fund (NYSEMKT:FEN). Currently, the fund is trading at a -5.25% discount.

This fund does not make an exception of course:\\n\\n\\n Source: barchart.com - GER Daily Chart (1 year) 6. Highest Effective Leverage \\n\\n Source: CEFConnect.com Closed-end funds are no strangers to leverage, and investors interested in this kind of products should be familiar with where their holdings stand in this regard. Do not underestimate the effect of the leverage, and be sure it is included in your analysis. The average effective leverage of the sector is 28.50%. 7. Lowest Effective Leverage \\n\\n Source: CEFConnect.com Of course, leverage is a double-edged sword because it might look great when the company is achieving great results and distributing big returns, but when it starts to sink, things start to get a little bit gloomy, I would say. What I mean is that the higher debt brings a bigger risk. 8. Highest Distribution Rate \\n\\n Source: CEFConnect.com Most of the fixed-income investors are drawn to closed-end funds because of their relatively high distribution rates. However, for me, the distribution rate of a fund is not the most important metric to look at. For long-term investors, a CEF\\'s total return is far more important than its distribution rate. Often, income-seeking investors become enamored with a CEF\\'s distribution rate. They lose sight of the share price return.\\n 9. Lowest Distribution Rate \\n\\n Source: CEFConnect.com The average yield on price for the sector is 12.15% and the average yield on net asset value is 10.92%. Conclusion The main reason for these weekly reviews is to track how the sector and its instruments are performing. Frankly speaking, there is not much improvement in the group. The past couple of years were tough for the MLP sector. The wide discounts, low Z-scores, and disappointing returns made the group more unattractive than ever. Note: This article was originally published on December 23, 2018, and some figures and charts might not be entirely up to date.\\nTrade With Beta\\nAt Trade With Beta, we also pay close attention to closed-end funds and are always keeping an eye on them for directional and arbitrage opportunities created by market price deviations.

The pizza chain delivered solid Q3 2018 top and bottom lines growth. However, its same store sales growth rate appears to be decelerating. Looking forward to 2019, the company will have to rely more on new store openings and improving its digital penetration rates to grow its overall sales. However, economic growth rates in the U.S. and other developed markets are expected to decelerate in 2019. This may makes it challenging for Domino’s Pizza to grow its sales. Its shares are currently trading at a premium valuation to its peers and we believe investors should apply higher margin of safety and wait for a better entry point. \\n\\n Source: YCharts Q3 2018 Highlights Domino’s Pizza posted solid Q3 2018 earnings. The company saw its revenue increase to $786 million (or 22.1%) in Q3 2018. It also saw its earnings increase to $84.1 million from $56.4 million in Q3 2017. Thanks to a combination of strong net income growth and a reduction to its weighted average diluted shares of 4.6 million in the past year, its adjusted earnings per share increased significantly to $1.95 per share from $1.27 per share in Q3 2017. This was a growth rate of 53.5% year over year. This was quite impressive. \\n\\n\\n Source: Q3 2018 Earnings Release Decelerating Same Store Sales Growth Rate Although Domino’s Pizza had a solid quarter, we are concerned about its decelerating SSSG in the past 2 years. As can be seen from the chart below, its domestic and international SSSG have declined from 13% and 6.6% in Q3 2016 to only 4.9% and 3.3% in Q3 2018 respectively. Although we think its Q3 2018 SSSG in domestic and international markets are still quite good, we fear that these rates will decelerate in 2019. \\n\\n Source: Created by author; Company Reports Is its decelerating growth rate a concern? In this section, we will discuss what Domino’s Pizza might take to improve its comparable sales growth and the outlook of its business in 2019. Digital platform should help increase its comparable sales Domino’s Pizza already has a high percentage of digital orders (primarily online, and mobile orders). In fact, digital orders now accounted for about 63% of total orders in 2017. This is significantly higher than the penetration rate of 60% back in 2016. The company has produced several innovative ordering platforms including Google Home, Facebook Messenger, Apple Watch, Amazon Echo, Twitter, and text messages. As management noted, there are several benefits of digital orders: higher average check size, better efficiency and accuracy, and lower labor costs. The company is hoping to increase its penetration for digital orders even more. Although Domino’s Pizza has not yet provided any digital penetration rate in 2018, we believe it should be higher than 2017 numbers. However, we think it may be challenging to grow its penetration rate much higher as it has reached over 60%. A global brand with strong growth potential\\n Since comparable sales growth rate appears to be decelerating, Domino’s Pizza will increasingly depend on new store openings to grow its retail revenues. However, we are also seeing a declining net new store openings trend (see chart below). In the first three quarters of 2018, the company has only opened 498 net new stores. This is much lower than the net stores addition of 623 and 722 added in 2017 and 2016 respectively. Therefore, it will be challenging for it to grow its total sales if both net store openings and comparable sales are declining. \\n\\n Source: Created by author; Company Reports Domestic growth rates expect to moderate in 2019 Like its peers, Domino’s Pizza’s growth outlook depends on economic growth prospects of the markets where it operates. Global GDP growth are expected to remain the same in 2019 based on IMF’s outlook that was published in October. However, in the advanced economies, growth outlook is expected to moderate from 2.4% growth rate in 2018 to 2.1% in 2019. \\n\\n Source: IMF World Economic Outlook In the U.S., the GDP growth rate is expected to decelerate to 2.5% in 2019 from 2.9% in 2018. Similarly, consumer spending in the U.S. is expected to decline by 20 basis points to 2.5% in 2019. Therefore, we believe this will make it difficult for Domino’s Pizza to accelerate its same store sales growth in 2019. \\n\\n\\n Source: RBC Economics Risks and Challenges Foreign exchange risk Domino’s Pizza collects over $50 million royalties and fees from its international franchise stores in Q3 2018. The strengthening US dollar against certain currencies in the quarter has negatively impacted its international royalty revenues by about $1.9 million in the past quarter. Although foreign exchange risk is uncontrollable (due to a combination of macroeconomic, geopolitical, etc. factors), investors should keep in mind of this risk. Competition risk U.S. quick service restaurant industry is a mature industry. Therefore, Domino’s Pizza will continue to face strong competition from other brands. In addition, there are more restaurants that are able to compete in the home delivery space thanks to the rise of delivery platforms such as UberEATS. Interest rate risk Domino’s Pizza has increased its debt significantly from about $1.5 billion in 2015 to about $3.5 billion today. As a result, its debt-to-asset ratio has increased from about 2.4 in 2015 to 3.8 in Q3 2018. Although its debt-to-asset ratio is high, we think it is fair because a significant portion of Domino’s Pizza’s revenue comes from royalties that do not require a lot of assets to generate it. However, there has been 8 rate hikes in the past 2 years in the United States. Therefore, if Domino’s Pizza continues to incur more debt, it risks paying higher interest expenses if Federal Reserve decide to continue its path to raise the interest rate. \\n\\n Source: YCharts Premium Valuation Share price of Domino’s Pizza has declined by about 20% in the past 4 months. Despite the weakness, its shares are still trading at a price to earnings ratio of 30.7x. This is nearly 4.5x multiples higher than McDonald’s (MCD) 26.4x and over 12x multiples higher than and Darden Restaurants’ (DRI) 18.5x. It is also more than 16x multiples higher than Dunkin Brands Group’s (DNKN) 14.6x.\\n \\n\\n Source: YCharts Domino’s Pizza’s shares have been trading at an average P/E ratio of 17.8x since its IPO in 2004. We think the company should be trading at higher multiples than its peers due to its better growth prospect but we think its current P/E ratio of 30.7x may face downward revision due to a possible deceleration in its same store sales in 2019. Consistent dividend increase  Domino’s Pizza has increased its dividend every year since 2013 thanks to its expansion strategy and strong comparable sales growth. Its quarterly dividend has increased from $0.20 per share in 2013 to $0.55 per share in 2018. This was a growth rate of 175% in 5 years. We expect the company to increase its dividend by double-digit next year given its low payout ratio of 25%. \\n\\n Source: YCharts Investor Takeaway Despite a strong Q3 2018, Domino’s Pizza’s SSSG rate is expected to decelerate further in 2019. Hence, it will be difficult to justify its current share price valuation. Hence, we think investors should exercise caution and patiently wait for a pullback.

U.S Financials have been also hit badly during the recent sell-off. The market sentiment towards banking stocks has changed dramatically. As shown below, there has been the largest outflow from Financial Select Sector SPDR ETF (XLF) since 2008 lately. \\n\\n Source: Bloomberg In addition, short interest has increased to the highest in more than two years and we would not rule out that a strong rally in US financials on 26 December was short-lived as it was largely driven by the short-covering. \\n\\n Source: Bloomberg The yield curve continues to flatten and that was likely the main reason of such a weakness in U.S banking equities. The spread between the yields on 10-year and 2-year Treasury notes (10-2yr spread) is now less than 20bps.\\n \\n\\n Source: Bloomberg The chart below plots the 10-2yr spread and the performance of XLF since 1999 (please note that the dynamics of XLF is inverted to show the correlation more clearly). As you can see, historically there has been a very strong negative correlation. \\n\\n Source: Bloomberg Indeed, conventional wisdom holds that most banks have a spread-based business model as they borrow at short rates and lend at long rates. As a result, a flatter yield curve is negative for the banks’ margins. However, as we noted in our prior articles, we believe the relationship between the banks’ margins and the US curve is much more complex than simply that. US banks are vastly different institutions in terms of balance sheet structures, loan mixes, securities portfolios, and funding profiles. In other words, there are asset-sensitive banks and liabilities-sensitive banks in the sector. As such, understanding the differences between them is crucial in a rising rate environment. What should long-term investors do? We do not have a crystal ball to predict short-term movements in the US banking equities as those are likely to be driven by macroeconomic factors rather than company-specific events. The yield curve will remain a key factor. As the chart below demonstrates, US banking stocks were quite volatile during the 2004-2006 tightening cycle, providing very attractive opportunities for short-term trades.\\n \\n\\n Source: Bloomberg However, as investors, we prefer to focus on fundamentals. Of course, there is still a lot of uncertainty in the equity markets, and we believe it would be very naive of us to claim that U.S. banks’ fundamentals will remain unchanged if the operating environment deteriorates from here. As of now, US banks enjoy stable-to-rising margins, moderate loan growth, and very benign asset quality trends. Without a doubt, all of them could change very quickly and it seems the market is pricing quite a sharp deterioration of those operating metrics. After all, banking is a highly cyclical industry, and we are late in the cycle. As such, we are taking a look at two factors that are really crucial for banks in a recession/a financial crisis. The first thing is liquidity. The Fed continues to gradually reduce its balance sheet, and that is basically quite a sharp liquidity drain for the system. The Fed’s balance sheet \\n\\n Source: Bloomberg What’s important here is that US banks have significantly improved their liquidity levels since the global financial crisis. The chart below shows the sector’s loan-to-deposit ratio, which, in our view, is currently at a very comfortable level, especially compared to the 2006-2008 period. \\n\\n\\n Source: Bloomberg Another key factor is the capital position. The sector’s Tier 1 capital ratio increased from 7% in 2011 to almost 12% in Q318, and US banks showed an impressive improvement in their capital positions. \\n\\n Source: Bloomberg Valuation Goldman Sachs (GS) and Citi (C) are trading below 8x forward earnings. \\n\\n Source: Bloomberg, Renaissance Research estimates But they are still not cheap given their low RoTEs.  \\n\\n Source: Bloomberg, Renaissance Research estimates \\n\\n Source: Bloomberg Bottom line Although operating metrics of U.S. banks remain stable and even show some signs of improvements, we believe 2019 will be a choppy year for financial stocks.

Xerox was undervalued at $25. It is even more undervalued now. Xerox is one of a flock of \"fallen angels\" - companies that were investment grade but were downgraded to junk. Xerox operating income increased 33% and it has the technical and financial resources to expand its niche and grow revenue. It is a strong buy. Key Investment Ratios By the key investment ratios, Xerox is attractive to a value investor. These are summarized in the following table. The P/E is half that of the depressed industry. It is 6.5 vs. 12.9 for the industry. The Standard and Poor\\'s 500 ratio is 20. \\n\\n The price to book value is 1.2 to the industries 2.2. This ratio is less favorable because goodwill is $3.9 billion compared to total equity of $5.3 billion. The price is 0.5 of sales compared to the industry\\'s average of 0.7.\\n Xerox\\'s dividend is $1.0 per share or 5.3% of the share price. This is also unusually high. Operating Results Moody\\'s has downgraded the debt because of the decline in the market for copiers and printers and intense global competition. The following table demonstrates that the revenue is continuing to decline at three percent per year. Moody\\'s is correct about the continuing decline in imaging. However, cost reductions of 5% of revenue lead to a 33% increase in operating income. Purchases from Fuji Xerox represent 70% of the cost of sales. Management expects that competition to find the lowest cost suppliers and greater commonality will reduce the cost of sales. They are also simplifying the complex computer systems and procedures left over from the time when Xerox was a larger company.\\n\\n The benefits of the higher operating income were more than offset by a prior year tax charge, so the net income declined. The Impact of the Downgrade A lower credit rating means that Xerox will eventually pay higher interest on its debt. Notes due in 2021 now sell with a yield increase of 56 basis points on a billion dollars of debt. That is $5.6 million before the tax deduction. Xerox has $5.3 billion of debt. Bloomberg analysts published a report identifying secular declines and execution challenges at Xerox two months before the downgrade. These issues are real. The imaging market has continually declined. The fact that cost reductions exceeded the decline in 2018 does not mean they will do so in the future. Thus, Xerox cannot get back to investment grade by paying down debt. They must stop the decline in revenue. Xerox Upsides Carl Icahn, who controls Xerox, agrees. The new management has pledged to present a plan to revive the business on February 5. Management\\'s four objectives are:\\n  Drive Revenue Optimize operations for simplicity to better serve customers and partners. Re-energize the innovation engine. Focus on cash flow and increase capital returns.  Management is succeeding in optimizing revenue, but not in driving revenue enough to maintain flat copier and printing revenue. Management will present its plans to expand the market niche. The success of these plans is not certain but there are reasons for optimism. Xerox spends more than $400 million per year on research and development. They originated the ink jet and sell print heads for 3D printers to manufacture parts. The concepts include selling software separate from printers, printing directly on plastic containers, printing electronic circuit boards etc. Copiers and printers are commodities but high-speed printers for print shop application are differentiated products. Xerox has $1.2 billion of cash. They have good cash flow, so they have the financial resources as well as the technical strength to expand their niche. Conclusions Carl Icahn likes his cash, so it is likely that the dividend will not be cut. His reputation is to run the company for short-term gains and dump it. In this case, the profitable move is to get revenue growth, which requires expanding the niche. He has contempt for the last two Xerox CEOs whom he believes grossly mismanaged the business. This leads him to believe that he can get the business growing again. Icahn fought a $40 per share offer for Xerox. He anticipates that the business can be made to be worth more than $40.\\nDisclosure: I/we have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

It has only recently hit the high levels we saw during the last expansion.  The FT has a nice piece of the waning effect of the tax cuts package.

Large-cap indexes topped the gainers. However, mid and small caps also move higher. Micro-caps were the only sector that was down. Let\\'s turn to the sectors:\\n\\n Everybody was up; the only difference was degree. Basic materials and industrials -- two sectors that usually rally at the beginning of an expansion -- led the way higher. Oddly, technology and consumer discretionary were near the bottom. More defensive sectors were up, but marginally.  Let\\'s turn to charts:\\n\\n Prices gapped lower at the open and traded sideways for most of the session.

But, as with the 2-week chart, prices are also starting to make meaningful upward progress. They\\'re now a few points below the 200-minute EMA.\\n\\n On the daily chart, prices hit the lows from early February. We\\'re also a bit below the 10-day EMA.

LyondellBasell (LYB) is a company with strong and reliable growth in the past, which in addition pays excellent dividends. Therefore, it is wise to ignore the current negative sentiments and buy its stock at discount. LyondellBasell on numbers LyondellBasell is one of the biggest polymer, chemicals, and refining companies in the world. Their main production sites are in Europe and US. The core business is to focus on production of polyolefins, such as polyethylene and polypropylene. Since 2011-2017, LyondellBasell\\'s net income has grown from ~$2 billion to ~$4.9 billion, representing a CAGR of 16%. This growth has increased significantly in the period from Q4/2017 to Q3/2018, with net income reaching $5.89 billion. Dividend yields have been growing in the same time from 1.69-3.21% and will even climb to 4.91% in 2018. Despite this strong financial numbers, LYB stock price fell nearly 30% to $79.17 (as of 24.12.2018), resulting in a P/E of 5.298. This is the company\\'s lowest P/E ratio since 2014. Meanwhile, the average industry P/E is approximately 14, which is nearly three times that of LyondellBasell. In comparison with other competitors in the same sector, LyondellBasell is now traded at an enormous discount level.   Company P/E ratio (24.12.2018)   DowDuPont (DWDP) 156.38   Lanxess (OTCPK:LNXSF) 18.29   BASF (OTCQX:BASFY) 17.00   Exxon Mobil (XOM) 12.27   Braskem (BAK) 10.01   Total S.A. (TOT) 9.47   LyondellBasell 5.30   Together with the growing net income, LyondellBasell also managed to deliver a stable annual profit margin of around 9% for the last 5 years compared to only 6.4% that of the industry average. This trend is likely to remain. In the last quarter report, LyondellBasell showed a stable growth in most of its operations and an increase of ~16% in sales and other operating revenues. \\n\\n (Source: Q3/2018 report) Future growth drivers The acquisition of A. Schulman is expected to make a large contribution to LyondellBasell\\'s revenue In February 2018, the company announced to acquire A. Schulman, Inc. (NASDAQ:SHLM) - a leading global supplier of high-performance plastic compounds, composites, and powders - for a total purchase price of $2.25 billion. This acquisition is expected to make LyondellBasell a leading advanced polymer solutions business and will help to bring an additional $2.5 billion revenue per year. Even though the acquisition was just completed in the end of August 2018, it has already shown positive results on the company\\'s balance sheet. In the Q3/2018 financial statement, the company reported: The acquisition of A. Schulman contributed $269 million to revenues of the APS segment, which accounts for revenue increases in the third quarter and first nine months of 2018 of approximately 36% and 13%, respectively, relative to the corresponding periods of 2017.\" \\n\\n (Source: LyondellBasell presentation)\\n The decrease in feedstock price is another advantage for the company\\'s future growth In September 2018, analyst Jeffrey Zekauskas rated LyondellBasell down due to the increase of feedstock price. This was also the main reason why its stock price suffers a decrease this year. Indeed, LYB\\'s cost of sales is heavily affected by feedstock prices. However, this is no longer a problem, as the prices for ethane, NGL, and oil have been declining steadily since then. As written in the transcript from 30.10.2018: While most observers agree that ethane will be abundant in the long term, supply constraints in the recent weeks have caused prices to escalate from below $0.30 per gallon to over $0.60 per gallon. This past week, we\\'ve seen prices moderate to the low $0.30 per gallon range. This volatility is driven by an increase in ethane demand from new crackers, and exports combined with constraints in midstream pipeline and fractionation capacity\". More importantly, even though the volatility might be temporary, the company is also able to operate with naphtha as feedstock, which is much cheaper than NGL: LyondellBasell\\'s fleet of U.S. Gulf Coast crackers have very high feedstock flexibility. The chart on the right shows you the range of feedstocks where we can operate. As you can see, we are able to use as little as 25% ethane and as much as 65% naphtha in our feed.\" LyondellBasell Spheripol Technology captures the highest global market share and continues to be used more widely around the world. There are various ways to produce Polypropylene (PP), of which, the two most common techniques are the UNIPOL PP Technology and LyondellBasell Spheripol Technology. When compared to other techniques, LyondellBasell Spheripol Technology is advantageous not only because it is more efficient but also because it is more eco-friendly. Thanks to the high specificity-controlled morphology catalyst, Spheripol Technology causes much less pollution, which helps to protect both the environment and workers\\' health. Thus, it is the most popular technique used globally, accounting for around 39% market share of PP resin production compared to only 16% that of UNIPOL PP Technology. Moreover, LYB continues to attract new customers for this state-of-the-art technology. Within only the first ten months of 2018, the company acquired 16 new license agreements for polyethylene and polypropylene plants around the world - the most ever in the company history.\\n Risk LyondellBasell is now negotiating for a possible acquisition of Braskem, the largest petrochemical company in Latin America. Braskem, which has now $1.75 billion in cash and $9.66 billion in debt, is currently valued at ~$4 billion. If the acquisition doesn\\'t turn out to be profitable, this can be a big setback for LyondellBasell. Braskem was involved in a bribery scandal in 2015, where the company faced allegation of purchasing naphtha from Petrobras (PBR) below market prices. Because of this, its stock price plunged by 20.3 percent on March 11, 2015. In the end, Braskem had to face several lawsuits, of which, the one in December 2016 resulted in $957 million regulatory penalties. This scandal had negatively affected the company\\'s reputation, however, BAK managed to recover under a new management team. Nevertheless, the acquisition of Braskem is quite complicated since it requires the agreement of all large stakeholders. In late 2017, Braskem denied the takeover and showed lack of interest for this transaction. In July 2018, LyondellBasell announced to reach an important agreement with Odebrecht S.A., who holds 50.1% of Braskem\\'s voting power. However, Petrobras - the other large stakeholder that owns 47% of BAK - abandoned the plan to sell its shares and even exercised preferential rights to buy Odebrecht\\'s stake. In November 2018, Reuters announced that LyondellBasell is close to reaching an agreement. The Braskem deal is now still in process and the negotiations are going back and forth, which is normal for such a high target acquisition. However, it is still unclear how much LyondellBasell has to pay in the end. Reuters reported the sum could even top $9 billion, which is more than double its current market capitalization. Even though there are some downside risks, the acquisition of Braskem - the biggest plastic producer in Latin America - can help LyondellBasell to expand strategically in this region. With a current P/E ratio of ~10, Braskem is not too expensive and if the transaction is going well, it can bring additional value for LyondellBasell in the long term.\\n Conclusion LyondellBasell is a company with state-of-the-art technology and strong future perspectives. The closed acquisition of A. Schulman and the negotiation with Braskem show that the company is willing to expand. Through A. Schulman, the company grows vertically with advanced polymer products. Meanwhile, the combination with Braskem will help the company to grow horizontally into Latin America, one of the potential super markets in the future. In the past, LyondellBasell has reached a P/E ratio of 15.14. If we are more conservative and assume that the high future growth would raise its PE to around 10, then its price can nearly double today\\'s price and reach $140. This is not something impractical since the company\\'s stock price before being downgraded was already $112.23 (as of 02.01.2018). In addition, the company also pays formidable dividends, making it even more attractive. Therefore, buyers should ignore the current market tumble and use this chance to buy LYB\\'s share.\\nDisclosure: I/we have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

There are concerns of the economy moving forward, concerns that I do not share and have written about multiple times on Seeking Alpha. Instead, I believe that while the U.S. economy is slowing relative to its hyper growth pace from ultra-low rates, the economy in general is still expanding and will continue to do so. The U.S. consumer is seeing their incomes increase at steady rates and consumption is moving along with that. One of the items that consumers will continue to buy is real estate. While there has been a recent lull in recent housing numbers, I believe this is to be short lived; real estate purchases and prices will start moving higher again.  Home Prices Continue Higher And Higher The Case-Shiller Home Price Index has seen a small lull in price activity lately. If you look closely at the chart, you will see that there is a general lull in price activity for a few months out of the year (Housing bubble bursting in 2008, notwithstanding). Then, like clockwork, there is a move higher in the index: \\n\\n If you looked at this chart and worked under the assumption that history repeats itself, then you would be working under the assumption that the price index will pick back up and start moving higher again in just a few more months' time. \\n This is cyclical and real estate industry participants will tell you that the beginning of the year is when a large demographic of home buyers begins the quest to buy a new home. That demographic is families with school-aged children. Their hope is to purchase a home and move in before the start of next year's school term. We are just about to see the beginning of that process ramp up again.  But, both new home sales and existing home sales have been declining and the data is showing signs of weakness: \\n\\n \\n\\nAgain, I see this as being cyclical; a smaller move in a bigger picture. While both of these charts are well off their recent highs, they are still relatively on the higher side. The recent moves higher in existing homes sales may suggest that the bottom has been reached in this smaller cycle, and both data points will advance higher from here.  At the same time, it has been difficult to pin down why home builders have been so subdued with their numbers. If real estate prices were to continue higher and higher, in a perfect, linear economy, wouldn't more and more supply enter the market? This simply has not been the case.  This is where analysis of the housing market gets interesting to me. Price continues to move higher and higher. Yet, builders are not moving in to capitalize on that opportunity. If price continues to move higher, wouldn't a home builder be supplying in an economic segment that is seeing increasing price gains? If I were a builder, that would be a confidence boost to me when making a yes decision on building new projects. \\n Mortgage rates and socialism In a truly perfect market, with pure competition, interest rates would not be as subdued as they are. The reason is that the demand for money would push up interest rates (the inverse relationship would push prices on the underlying asset lower, however). As more and more individuals demanded mortgages, that demand would push up interest rates. This would balance the costs of a home, subduing demand. That would keep the price of homes lower.  However, the government has stepped in to keep interest rates at bay for long-term mortgage rates with the invention of Freddie Mac and Fanny Mae. I am a believer that the 30-year mortgage would be much higher in a perfect market. Instead, these pseudo-government agencies keep interest rates abnormally low. It's simple economics 101: With higher demand on money (interest rates), there would be higher price (home price).  Look again up at the Shiller Home Price Index. In a truly perfect market, as the price index increased, so too would the interest rate. This would act as a mechanism to keep prices lower. But, that does not happen, as the chart below shows: \\n\\n It is a philosophical question to ask: What would mortgage rates be like without Freddie and Fanny? The most obvious answer is: Higher. But, we don't live in the world without Freddy or Fannie, so we do not need to wonder too much about this. But, what I see is that mortgage rates are artificially low and because of that more and more individuals are capable of buying homes that perhaps they would not ordinarily be able to purchase.  There is another aspect of the economy and interest rates: Interest rates movements higher are reactionary; they are the effect, not the cause of an economy. The Federal Reserve is raising interest rates because the economy is expanding and inflation is moving higher. Consumers are consuming more, and one of the items they will continue to consume more of is homes. And, as long as interest rates for mortgages remain artificially lower than they could be, more and more consumers will opt to buy a home. This is the cycle of real estate. \\n I keep reiterating this, and it will be a constant drumbeat for me: The Federal Reserve is raising interest rate in reaction to an economy that is capable of sustaining higher rates. The Fed is not trying to slow the economy from hyper-growth; they are bringing rates up from their ultra-low levels.  Believe that he Fed's movements will not have any adverse effect on the consumer and therefore, the consumer will continue forward.  A Faltering Economy? There are many that believe the economy is likely to move into a small recession over the course of the next year. This is not a viewpoint I share. I look at the consumer's income as the starting point of my analysis. Here is the latest chart from both Personal Income and Personal Expenditures - my chart, via The Bureau of Economic Analysis: \\n\\nWhen incomes for families increase at a higher rate, then those families purchase items at a greater rate, all relative to the year prior. This is for when I analyze the economy, what is the rate of growth?  My expectation is that incomes and consumption will move higher in the next 3-6-9 months, both gravitating towards the 3.50% Year-Over-Year growth rate (given the chart data above). This, despite moves higher in short-term interest rates. Ultimately, this will translate into a continuation of the bigger move higher in real estate purchases and prices. Keep in mind, economics is not an event, it is a process.  I have largely shrugged off the minutia of the data we have seen that suggest a broader slowing of the economy. To me, there is not enough there yet to derail my analysis. So far, I've been proven right. However, while I believe the consumer remains healthy, and so should the outlook for the economy, there are concerns, or potential headwinds. Certainly our mercurial president could easily derail our economy in many ways. \\n First is the threat of an even greater trade war. While I do not want to go too far down this road, I will say that I share some of the concerns of our president with regards to fair trade. I would not mind seeing America gain some concessions from this. But, I hope that any concessions gained do not come at an exasperated expense to the economy. I feel that the forthcoming results will be amicable and the economy can move forward with an eventual lifting of tariffs.  Also, there are concerns of the Fed not being entirely autonomous, although the very most recent news suggests the president may be backing down from this latest cause he has undertaken. The record move higher in the stock market on the day after Christmas suggests this is the case. It is my personal belief that all the noise that has been made in this area of our economy is over with.  If, however, the economy does see some faltering from some of the issues we have seen lately, then it will be back to the drawing board for my analysis. These are things that I keep in the back of my mind, but for now I am resolute that the consumer, and hence, the economy, remain firm and expansionary.  What To Look For With Real Estate In Coming Months If you want to see what is going to happen with real estate over the course of the next 6 - 12 months, keep a sharp eye on the consumer's income and consumption numbers. Both have been edging up slightly over the past few months. This will translate into an increased rate of purchases for real estate; this also means a continuation of the bigger upward move in the Case-Shiller Index.  I firmly believe that our economy will continue its expansion. I expect that areas of our economy will continue to see positive data. And, real estate is one of those areas that I see this happening with. \\nDisclosure: I/we have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

E-Mini S&P: Bearish Trend Momentum This holiday week we have experienced a tremendous amount of volatility. However, the E-Mini S&P Weekly Report I published in Seeking Alpha\\'s Marketplace under my Mean Reversion service on November 28 gave us a pretty good idea of how to manage this type of volatility. With the E-mini S&P closing at 2414, it gave us pretty good indication that as we came into this week we had a bearish trend momentum due to the fact that the 9-day moving average at 2665 is higher than the close of 2414. That meant we had a bearish trend momentum coming into this week. This analysis is one of the filters that we use to identify the momentum of the market on a daily, weekly and monthly basis, and which the VC PMI uses to automate and process market signals. I am trying to show you the components of the VC PMI in terms of its artificial intelligence. \\n\\n\\n Courtesy: ema2trade.com A Contrarian System Since the VC PMI is based on the principle of reversion to the mean, it is a contrarian system in relation to most trend-following systems. After many years in the business, I\\'ve learned that the volatility or price of a financial instrument tends to move its relative implied volatility to extreme levels. Once we can identify the average price or mean, whether on a daily, weekly or monthly basis, we can begin to extrapolate the potential relative extreme implied volatility above and below that mean. With the methodology of the VC PMI\\'s artificial intelligence in place, the algorithm identifies for us extreme levels above and below the market with high probabilities, which were a reversion to the mean in terms of price are highly likely to occur. The methodology that we teach our subscribers at the Equity Management Academy is focused on how to identify the trigger points when the price reaches and activates any of these extreme levels above and below the current average price. Weekly Price Momentum \\n\\n Courtesy: TD Ameritrade The second filter that we use is the weekly price momentum or the VC weekly price momentum indicator (PMI). Coming into this week, the VC weekly PMI gave us a price of 2480. The artificial intelligence told us that since the market closed below 2480 at 2414, the sentiment of the market was bearish coming into this week. This analysis confirmed the first filter, which was the trend momentum, and now we are getting confirmation of the second filter, which is the price momentum, where it\\'s a 50/50 standard deviation that identifies for us the momentum of the market. However, it\\'s clearly stated that even though we came into this week with a bearish trend momentum, it identifies where to cover your positions with the highest probability factor. The VC PMI gives us two levels below the mean. The first is the buy 1 (B1) level, which is at 2343 and the second is the buy 2 (B2) level, which is at 2272.\\n So when you as a self-directed individual have access to this information a day, a week or a month ahead of time, you can create your own structure in your portfolio in stocks, commodity options or futures. The report told you that if the market comes down from 2414 be prepared to buy at the B1 level of 2342, which has a 90% probability factor that the market will revert back to the average price of 2480. The second level or B2 has a 95% probability of that reversion to occur and in this case, it told us that the B2 level coming into this week is at 2271. As we came into this week, the low that we made in the market was 2316.75, which was made on December 25. Unfortunately, the US markets were closed on Christmas day and this is what happens sometimes in the Globex markets when the players take advantage of the US markets being closed and they trade the Globex markets. You can see in the action in the market that the B1 level of 2343 has been activated a couple of times. On December 26, the market at about 12 am in the Globex session gave us a clear breakout point, with the market closing above the B1 level of 2343. It also closed above the 9-day moving average, which is a very strong signal that essentially met the target of 2480 as of December 26 at 9:15 am. When the market meets its target and completes the pattern, the VC PMI algorithm signal reverts back to neutral. In this case, the signal went long from 2343 with the target of 2480 (+37 ticks profit) in the weekly report, which we also call the swing report. We are back to neutral, waiting for the price to dictate the next trade. A close above 2480 would activate the bullish trend momentum of the market once again and activate a sell 1 (S1) target of 2550 and sell 2 (S2) of 2687. The extreme below the mean of 2480 is at the B1 level of 2343, while B2 is at 2272. With the market trading below the average price we are in a neutral to bearish sentiment and we are looking for the next trigger point in the weekly reports.\\n Please be aware that what we are talking about here is a contrarian system, which is called mean reversion trading. When the market is the most bullish, the system recommends going short and for sellers to take profits. When the market is the most bearish, such as just before the anticipated Christmas rally, the VC PMI recommended buying, which is what I told my subscribers. Please remember that this is a contrarian strategy, which goes against the general sentiment out there, and is something to be aware of when you apply the VC PMI. The VC PMI Automated Algorithm We use the proprietary Variable Changing Price Momentum Indicator (VC PMI) to analyze the precious metals markets. The primary driver of the VC PMI is the principle of reversion to the mean (\"Mean Reversion Models of Financial Markets\"; \"The Power of Mean Reversion in Factor-Based Investing\"), which is combined with a range of analytical tools, including fundamental logic, wave counts, Fibonacci ratios, Gann principles, supply and demand levels, pivot points, moving averages, and momentum indicators. The science of Vedic Mathematics is used to combine these elements into a comprehensive, accurate, and highly predictive trading system. Mean-reversion trading seeks to capitalize on extreme changes in the price of a particular security or commodity, based on the assumption that it will revert to its previous state. This theory can be applied to both buying and selling, as it allows a trader to profit on unexpected upswings and buy low when an abnormal low occurs. By identifying the average price (the mean) or price equilibrium based on yesterday\\'s supply and demand factors, we can extrapolate the extreme above this average price and the extreme below it. When prices trade at these extreme levels, it is between 90% and 95% probable that prices will revert back to the mean by the end of the trading session. I used this system to analyze the gold and silver markets. Strengths and Weaknesses The main strength of the VC PMI is the ability to identify a specific structure with price levels traders can execute with a high degree of accuracy. The program is flexible enough to adjust to market volatility and alerts you when such changes take place, so one can adjust strategies accordingly. Such changes include when the market breaks out of a consolidation phase or a trend accelerates. Such volatility usually happens when the market has produced a signal at the S2 or B2 level, and the market closes above or below these extreme levels. The day trading program then confirms that a higher fractal in price has been identified and the market will move significantly higher, although the same principle applies if the market falls significantly. By the price closing above the S2 level, it indicates that the buying demand is greater than the supply. This means that the market has found support for the next price fractal. Conversely, the price closing below the B2 level indicates that the selling pressure has met demand greater than supply at the extreme below the mean, and prices should revert back to the mean.\\n The basic concept of the VC PMI is that the program trades the extremes of supply and demand based on the average price daily, weekly, and monthly. The strongest relationship we find in the algorithm is when the daily price is harmonically in alignment with the weekly and monthly indicators. We call this \"harmonic timing.\" Such an indication produces the highest probability (90%) that the price will revert from these levels to its daily, weekly, or monthly average.

This is mainly because many companies in the sector suffered from declining stock prices and slower top line growth. Therefore, I moved from over-exposure to the sector to lack of exposure. I am looking for companies in this sector to fill the gap. The recent pullback in the stock market may offer some individual opportunities. I will try to look for them. However, I must note that I don't find the market as a whole cheap. I believe that this correction makes sense after another increase in the interest rate. The market is adjusting its valuation. Conservative investors should look at the consumer staples sector for low beta companies as part of a more defensive approach. In my previous article, I looked at Diageo (DEO). This time, I am looking at Nestle (OTCPK:NSRGY). Foreign companies are sometimes overlooked by American investors, and I will look for opportunities among them. I will analyze Nestle using the graph below, and I will try to determine whether Nestle is an attractive investment right now. \\n\\n Nestle operates as a food and beverage company. The company operates through Zone Europe, Middle East and North Africa, Zone Americas, Zone Asia, Oceania and sub-Saharan Africa. The company provides food, coffee, frozen foods, dairy products and drinks. The company was founded in 1866 and is headquartered in Switzerland. \\n\\n\\n Fundamentals The revenues may be a little bit misleading when looking at them in USD. Nestle is a multinational company located in Switzerland, and to better understand its fundamentals, it should be analyzed in Swiss Franc. The company managed to achieve low single digits growth in its top line as currency exchange rate damaged the results. The company manages to grow by combining volume growth and price increases. Earnings per share growth is much more impressive. It is supported not only by top line growth but also by cost cutting and share repurchases program that the company executes. In the past three years, the company managed to achieve EPS growth rate of around 5% on average. The management expects Nestle to keep performing in a similar way. Investors should therefore look for roughly 3-6% of the EPS growth. The dividend is a little tricky here since it is paid in CHF (Swiss Franc), and therefore affected by currency exchange rates. However, investors should take into account that the company does raise its dividend on an annual basis. Lately, the dividend hikes were lower than usual as the company is trying to lower its payout ratio. Right now, the dividend payout ratio is safe at 66%, and the current entry yield is 2.5% with expected growth rate of 2% annually in the medium term, not very impressive. While Nestle pays 66% of its income to its investors in the form of dividends, investors should also be grateful that the company returns cash to its shareholders in the form of buybacks. The current program is massive at CHF 20 billion and will last until mid-2020. I always see it as an advantage when a company can afford to supplement capital returns with buybacks. Valuation While the fundamentals are impressive, I believe that Nestle suffers from a similar problem to Diageo's problem - its valuation. Right now, the company trades for trailing P/E of right around 30, which is very high for a company with such modest growth. As an investor, I know that sometimes you have to pay some premium for quality, but the current valuation is hard to justify.\\n \\n\\nNSRGY PE Ratio (TTM) data by YCharts A look on the graph from Fastgraphs also shows us a similar picture. The share price has disconnected from the fundamentals, and while the EPS declined (in USD figure), the share price remained the same, and even rose. The average P/E ratio for Nestle is 17, so I find it hard to buy the company for such valuation. \\n\\n To summarize it, Nestle is a great company that enjoys strong fundamentals. The company also focuses on returning capital to its shareholders. However, while the fundamentals are strong, and the management has good intentions, the valuation seems very high. The only way to justify such valuation is if the company has some robust growth catalysts ahead. Opportunities Nestle offers a portfolio of very well-known brands. These are brands that can be found in almost any household, and their recognition gives Nestle pricing power which other brands may not have. Moreover, the company is not only diversified in terms of industries and products, it is also diversified globally. The company sells its products in all continents, which makes it more resilient to economic slowdowns or regulatory changes. \\n\\n\\n The company also focuses on the growing emerging markets. It makes perfect sense to put the emphasis there as the growth rate there is much higher than the growth rate in the developed world. The company intends to keep focusing on the emerging markets, and I see it as an advantage going forward, since it allows it to achieve higher growth. If growth rate in emerging markets gets three times faster, the long-term growth rate will improve. \\n\\n One of the problems of some of the largest American peers is that they weren't innovative enough. Companies like General Mills (GIS) and Kraft Heinz (KHC) were sure that what used to work, will always work. They didn’t adapt their products to the changing tastes of their consumers. Nestle on the other hand is very attentive to its consumers, and it creates products lines that fit the current trend. This is a major benefit going forward. It allows it to gain market share in developed markets. \\n\\n Risks While emerging markets offer growth opportunities, they also offer risks. They tend to be less politically stable and may suffer from swift regulatory changes. Moreover, their economies are less stable, and it can affect demand for Nestle's products. In addition, the revenues in those markets are achieved on local currencies, which are also less stable, and the changes in the exchange rates can have an impact on the short- and medium-term results. Another risk for American dividend growth investors is the fact that you may find yourself investing in a dividend growth company but see your dividend payments decreasing. This may happen due to the fact the US Dollar is very strong, and the dividend growth rate is very slow. The combination of that may show a dividend decrease in dollar figures. This can be solved by buying the shares in Switzerland, but the value in USD will still decrease. If you are very well diversified, you may consider buying assets in foreign currencies to increase your diversification even more.\\n Another risk for Nestle is the fact that some brands especially in the consumer staples sector are losing their strength. Consumers become more concerned with price as they believe that generic products offer similar quality, but superior pricing. Nestle will have to work hard to make sure that investors keep choosing its premium products. If not, it may see a steady decline in sales especially in the developed world which accounts for 53% of its sales. Conclusion I find Nestle to be very similar to Diageo. Both are very well-run companies. They deal with challenges and saturated markets and still manage to find paths for growth. While the fundamentals shown by Nestle are strong, and it has several growth catalysts and limited downside, I still find it hard to accept the current valuation. In my opinion, the company is overvalued right now. If an investor is still interested in investing in the company, I would recommend that we will do it in Switzerland. The liquidity is higher there, and as the company reports and operates in CHF, it makes more sense to do it. Investors who want exposure to foreign currencies should consider Nestle, but only at a much lower valuation. I will be interested if the share price decreases to around $55 with the current fundamentals.\\nDisclosure: I am/we are long KHC, GIS. I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions.

Since then, two camps have emerged in the investing community, with two contrasting views on the future of Facebook. One camp believes that Facebook will continue to shred its market value and company profits will decline, and on the contrary, the other camp believes that Facebook’s decline was undue and irrational, and Facebook will continue to gain its footing and remain the number one advertising platform of the world. In this analysis, I try to identify the reasons behind the share price crash and what the company management is doing to overcome the difficult times and achieve sustainable growth in profits. Thereafter, I focus on assigning a buy/sell rating to the company, based on an intrinsic value estimate. Why did Facebook shares decline 38% in 5 months? During the Q2 earnings conference call in July, the company management projected a decline in operating margins in the future, as the company plans to invest billions of dollars to improve safety measures to prevent data scandals from happening in the future. On the other hand, Facebook will look and feel different in the future, as the company is planning to prioritize Stories over the News Feed. Management commentary in the Q2 earnings conference call triggered the very first move in Facebook’s 38% decline. In fact, the stock lost 20% upon releasing its earnings and concluding the conference call.\\n Secondly, Facebook as a company was involved in a series of data scandals and has attracted scrutiny of various law-makers, around the globe. In September, Facebook announced a major security breach in which hackers were able to use a vulnerable portion of Facebook’s platform to access accounts of more than 50 million users. More recently, in December, A New York Times report claimed that Facebook was providing user information to major tech companies including Apple, Netflix and Google, regardless of privacy settings of users. These data scandals, coupled with a series of regulatory crackdowns on Facebook, contributed to the share price decline since July. Thirdly, senior executives started leaving Facebook, and this was seen as a major negative sign for Facebook’s future. The departure of these senior executives was seen as proof of the deteriorating future prospects of the company, and investors were keen to punish Facebook for not being able to retain top level talent. Below is a summary of executives who decided to leave Facebook in this year so far.   Name Nature of employment   Jan Koum Co-founder of WhatsApp   Elliot Schrage Head of communications and public policy   Colin Stretch Facebook’s top lawyer   Alex Stamos Chief Security Officer   Dan Rose Vice President of partnerships   Alex Hardiman Head of news products   Kevin Systrom Instagram co-founder   Mike Krieger Instagram co-founder   (Source – Data collected from company filings and CNBC) This extensive list constitutes of some executives who have already resigned, and others who have announced of their departures in the coming months. Investors are fair to raise concerns over these high profile departures, as a company’s eco-system is built around its senior executives. Fourthly, the introduction of the General Data Protection Regulation (GPDR) has made company’s survival in the European region more difficult, and Facebook has already lost millions of users in this region, since the introduction of these strict privacy rules. The advertising business of Facebook in the European region is expected to take a permanent hit with the implementation of GPDR. In line with these lower revenue expectations from the all-important European region, investors were quick to dump their Facebook shares, which paved the way for the massive erosion in market capitalization since July.\\n Among other reasons, the broad market negativity played its part as well. Since September, overall markets took a beating as part of the yield curve inverted, trade tensions rose and political woes continued to persist. What is Facebook doing to overcome these issues? Investors need to assess the present situation of Facebook by weighing in the positives against the negatives. Understanding why Facebook share price declined over the last few months does not provide an insight in to the future performance of the company. In this segment of the analysis, I focus on the initiatives taken by the company management so far, to tackle prevailing issues. On the earnings front, the company has revealed new plans to monetize its massive user base. Facebook still has access to a massive user base, which the company is not monetizing at the moment. WhatsApp is a prime example of such a user base, and the company has not fully monetized the Instagram user base as well. Facebook has 2 billion monthly active users \\n\\n (Source – Company presentation) In my opinion, investors need not base their focus on identifying whether Facebook’s monthly active user base is growing or not. The primary reason behind this is that Facebook is approaching its maturity now, and the company will of course not be able to grow its active user base in perpetuity. The focus here should be on how Facebook can continue to monetize a user base of more than 2 billion, while retaining this user base. Despite regulatory concerns, security breaches and data scandals, social media remains an important aspect of today’s society, and Facebook is the clear leader in this segment by miles. Instagram TV, Facebook Watch, monetizing WhatsApp and Messenger are all formidable plans, which would lead to a higher revenue base for the company.\\n On the other hand, margins will continue to compress as the company will invest significant amounts to improve security. However, improved security levels will help resurrect the trustworthiness of the brand, which is healthy for the long-term outlook of the company. Therefore, even if the company has to sacrifice current year profits to secure its competitive advantage and future profitability, this should not be seen as a negative trend. In any case, margins will still be significantly higher than its identifiable peers. \\n\\n (Source - Author prepared based on company filings) On the safety and security front, the company has taken a few measures to prevent data scandals from happening, and billions of dollars have been allocated to fund such measures. \\n\\n (Source - Author prepared based on company filings) In line with the roadmap released in 2016, the company is ramping up its investments to improve security measures until the end of 2019. While a company would never be able to fully tackle security threats, taking actions and being proactive so as not to encourage security breaches is the key, as is identified by Mark Zuckerberg.  We're judging our success by, go through all of the categories of harmful content and behavior, whether it's terrorism, or self-harm, or hate speech, or just any different kind of thing that you'd be worried about. We're judging our success by how proactive can we get, so what percent of the stuff that we're taking down are we identifying before other people identify it for us. We've started issuing transparency reports so we can be held publicly accountable on this. – Mark Zuckerberg, CEO \\n Facebook’s investments in improving security measures include doubling its security staff by adding contractors, security engineers and deploying artificial intelligence to identify possible security breaches. In my opinion, Facebook will never be able to eradicate security breaches or data scandals, but mitigating the impact of such occurrences should remain the primary focus, which is exactly what the company is focusing on at the moment. Next, Facebook is focused on bringing in top talent to replace the senior executives who left and are planning to leave. Facebook continues to remain one of the best places to work (number 07 in the United States), and this, coupled with the brand value of the company, should help Facebook attract top-notch talent. \\n\\n (Source – Glassdoor) Facebook has already hired the former deputy prime minister of the United Kingdom, Sir Nick Klegg, as the head of its global affairs and communications team. A number of resigning executives have indicated that they will support a smooth transition by assisting the process of recruiting top quality talent to replace their roles. To the credit of the management, they have identified the major risks the company is exposed to, and is working toward mitigating the impact of these issues on future earnings of the company. What’s more, the management has openly admitted of their willingness to trade current profits to achieve future sustainability, which is brave and commendable. Fair value estimate Many investment publications have recently focused on identifying the issues surrounding Facebook, and declaring that the company is not an attractive investment at the moment. On the contrary, bulls have emphasized on how Facebook can monetize its user base and grow, and claimed the company is a very attractive investment at present. However, I believe a company cannot be assigned a buy or sell rating, without estimating a fair value for its shares.\\n To arrive at a fair value estimate for Facebook, I have used a Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) method, with a 5-year forecast period. Terminal value is calculated using EBITDA multiples. Below is a discussion of the major assumptions used in arriving at the fair value estimate for Facebook. Revenue To project revenues in the forecast period, I have looked at historical revenue growth rates and applied a discount factor to reflect the maturing nature of Facebook’s business model. In addition, the company is shifting its focus from tried and tested methods and focusing on venturing into content streaming and monetizing Stories. It will take time for Facebook to understand how to drive revenue from these segments, and I believe billion dollar investments in these segments will yield comparatively lower results for a couple of years. \\n\\n (Source - Author prepared based on company filings) During the last 5 years, revenue has grown at a Compounded Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) of 51.5%. Despite this stellar revenue growth, I have estimated revenues will grow at a CAGR of 22%, from 2017 through 2022. \\n\\n (Source - Author's calculations) EBITDA margin Over the last 4 years, Facebook’s EBITDA margin has improved from 49% in 2014 to 58% in 2017. However, the Trailing Twelve Months (TTM) EBITDA margin rests at just 55%, which represents the beginning of margin deteriorations. In the coming years, operating margin will further deteriorate and this will adversely affect free cash flows, which I have incorporated into my DCF analysis.\\n \\n\\n (Source - Author prepared based on company filings) During the forecast period, I believe the EBITDA margin will continue to fall and settle for around 49% in 2022. \\n\\n (Source - Author's calculations) I forecast the EBITDA margin to fall at a faster rate till 2020, as Facebook accelerates its spending on creating original content for Facebook Watch, increase investments to improve security measures and face margin compression arising from higher administrative costs. However, beyond 2020, I expect the company to reduce its spending on security-related improvements, and on the other hand, Facebook Watch, Stories and other monetizing initiatives focused on WhatsApp and Instagram will start yielding better results on dollars spent. Based on these assumptions, I expect EBITDA margin to slightly improve from 2022 and beyond. Capital expenditures Historically, capital expenditures have accounted for less than 20% of Facebook’s revenue, but under prevailing conditions, the company is forced to spend a much higher portion of its revenue as capital expenditures. In line with this assumption, I expect capital expenditures to reach a high of around 25% - 26% of revenue, and then to settle for around 19% of company revenues. Finally, to calculate terminal value, I have used an EBITDA multiple of 9.5 times, and a discount rate of 9.5% was used throughout the process. With these assumptions, I have arrived at a fair value estimate of $158 for Facebook shares, which represents an upside of 18%.\\n \\n\\n (Source - Author prepared based on author's calculations) One major point to note is that I have used conservative assumptions in the model, from Facebook’s standards. Being one of the most-followed stocks, Facebook usually tends to trade at a premium. In addition, even though I believe growth rates will deteriorate in the forecast period, Facebook might once again grow at a faster rate beyond the forecast period, driven by the possibility of a massive success in monetizing WhatsApp and becoming a leader in the content streaming industry. To add some perspective on the conservative assumptions I have used, we can look at the consensus analyst estimate for Facebook share price, which is closer to $200, than to $150. \\n\\n (Source – Market Beat) Conclusion Facebook has attracted a lot of attention, both from bulls and bears, in the last couple of months.

Micron Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ: MU) has shown its ability to take off amidst the price boom for memory, but has also come crashing down with the subsequent weakness in prices. In the points below, I outline why it may be the time to increase your position. Look At This Rocket Ship Micron Technology\\'s stock price has largely faltered after the latest earnings release and not without good reason. Going into the call, average revenue estimates were $7.35bn and $2.96 earnings per share for the quarter. Actual revenue generated for the quarter exceeded expectations by roughly 8% or $600m while eps was relatively in-line with expectations. On the surface, all is fine and dandy with MU\\'s continued surge in growth, margins, and indelible memory technology; however, there\\'s more to the story. It\\'s easy to look at a 2.6x price-to-earnings ratio and get excited about a great company with strong growth prospects in an industry that is booming. Don\\'t take my word for it though, look at the historical performance of this business: \\n\\n (Source - Jeffery Margolf;Macrotrends) It almost looks like a stock photo you\\'d get from Google by searching for \"finance.\" All jokes aside, Micron has delivered outstanding performance over the last three years largely due to market dynamics and demand for memory. In fact, in the last 15 months alone, Micron returned $3.45bn back to investors in the form of share repurchases and even pledged in their last earnings call a commitment to deliver ~50% of free cash flow to additional share repurchases. Under the existing program, which was approved by the board last quarter, there\\'s an ~$8.2bn remaining in capacity for FY2019. I\\'ll touch on this point later, but this signal clearly shows management\\'s conviction in the business.\\n What Comes Up Must Come Down It seems as though someone flipped a switch on June 4th, 2018 when Micron hit a high of $61.39. It\\'s been a precipitous drop since that date as the stock has now fallen roughly 50%. Talk about volatility. Is this rocket ship out of fuel and now we\\'re just witnessing the boosters burning up in the atmosphere? Let\\'s delve a bit deeper. \\n\\n (Source - Yahoo Finance) The End Of Moore\\'s Law Typically, debut technology is priced markedly higher during initial launch with a predictable decline after market adoption. This trend has been observable in TVs, computers, smartphones, and just about any form of consumable technology. Moore\\'s Law has allowed for the rapid acceleration of technology, by packing in as many transistors as possible into a chip to advance its computing power. By improving and introducing new generations of chips, older models quickly become obsolete and lose their inherent value, driving price declines across older models. This ideology has persevered for over 50 years, but many industry experts now believe the end is in sight. You may ask: Where am I going with this? The key to this conclusion is that we will be facing a wall within the next decade where any advances in the next iPhone or laptop will be rather lackluster or indistinguishable. Some may argue, we\\'ve already hit this barrier at least figuratively speaking. How does this factor into Micron and its trajectory? Hint: I\\'m getting there. Memory Chip Industry Dynamics There are three major players in the memory chip space: Samsung (OTC:SSNLF), Sk Hynix (KRX: 000660), and Micron, who each control approximately 46%, 29%, and 21% of the market, respectively. In other words, this is an oligopoly where the three largest players have relative pricing control and supply of their products. As we get closer to the end of Moore\\'s Law, it becomes increasingly more expensive and difficult to procure more advanced chips, straining supply and ultimately enhancing prices. This was witnessed over the last two years due to a spike in memory chip demand and supply bottlenecks:\\n \\n\\n (Source - Enterprisetech) As 2018 has progressed, supply has now usurped demand, and as a result prices for DRAM and NAND are expected to drop dramatically. With it, MU\\'s stock price performance has also nose dived due to its reliance on maintaining margins for its products to support capital expenditures and free cash flow. Don\\'t Panic What I\\'ve outlined here is transitory. Each of the three largest players have signaled planned reductions in memory production growth and capital expenditures in order to stabilize prices. With the continued proliferation of AI and IoT, along with further data server integration to meet the needs of cloud-based computing, long-term memory needs are here to stay. There\\'s an overarching theme for the 21st century: Big data. If you believe in the large behemoths to continue disrupting the world we live in - e.g., Google (GOOGL), Amazon (AMZN), Facebook (FB), Netflix (NFLX), Apple (AAPL), do I need to continue? Then you should believe in the companies that will meet their storage (hardware) needs. I\\'m an avid believer in a future which will depend on an evolving need for memory solutions. I\\'ll use the rest of this article to highlight MU\\'s current short-term trajectory. What\\'s Next? I used a GGM/CAPM to assess the current share price for Micron with fairly conservative assumptions (at least in my view).           Pro-forma     ($m\\'s) 2019 2020 2021 2022 2023 5-year CAGR   Revenue $26,113 $26,542 $26,977 $27,862 $29,234 -0.8%   % growth rate -14.1% 1.6% 1.6% 3.3% 4.9%     Operating Income $11,739 $11,932 $12,128 $12,526 $13,142 -2.6%   % margin 45.0% 45.0% 45.0% 45.0% 45.0%     Net Income 10,877 11,055 11,237 11,606 12,177 -2.9%   % margin 41.7% 41.7% 41.7% 41.7% 41.7%     While these margins may not necessarily be reflective of the current pricing dynamic, I\\'ve factored in a 23% decline in earnings in FY\\'19 YoY. $26bn revenue projection factors in the low-end of management guidance for Q2\\'19 with a slight recovery in the second half of FY\\'19. At the same time, I\\'ve factored in $9.5bn of capital expenditures for FY\\'19 with a ~3% growth rate for the next four years. Without getting into too many of the specifics, I estimated a fair value per share of $33.54, largely in line with the current share price. While this does not leave much upside, I would also argue my model is skewed to portray extended market weakness and virtually no growth - a thesis I would largely argue against. To provide reassurance, I believe my assessment of the fair value of this business creates ample upside with a measurable lower bound. Going back to share repurchases - which I outlined earlier, this model would assert zero additional buybacks for FY\\'19. What Could Go Wrong? The memory industry is largely seen as a commoditized business now and with the entry of new market participants, especially from China, many see the continued price decline of memory. A competitor who is able to clone the existing quality of memory chips with lower prices may be able to significantly disrupt the industry. With Moore\\'s law coming to an end, the market may be drawing towards a close of innovation, where existing players will consolidate and provide standardized products on a no-frills basis, achieving economies of scale. Whoever is at the forefront of redesigning computer architecture and breaking Moore\\'s law, may become the world\\'s next tech stalwart, commanding out-sized profits for the foreseeable future.\\nDisclosure: I am/we are long MU.

It is cheap on a valuation basis, had recent insider buying in November and thanks to losing half its value from its highs in 2018; provides an over four percent yield. \\n\\n Company Overview: Olin Corporation (OLN) is a Clayton, Missouri based manufacturer of commodity chemicals and ammunition. Initially founded in 1892, the company has a market cap of ~$3.25 billion and employs ~6,400 throughout the world. Olin grew its scale significantly when it purchased Dow Chemical\\'s (now DowDuPont Inc. (DWDP) Chlor Alkali and Vinyl, Global Chlorinated Organics, and Global Epoxy businesses for a consideration of ~$5 billion consisting of cash ($2 billion), stock (~$2.2 billion), and liability assumption (~$0.8 billion) in 2015. Operating Segments: The company has three operating segments: Chlor Alkali Products and Vinyls, Epoxy, and Winchester. Chlor Alkali Products and Vinyls. Olin\\'s Chlor Alkali Products and Vinyls division is the global leader in chlor-alkali production and caustic soda sales, as well as the top seller of chlorine, industrial bleach, and hydrochloric acid in North America. For those unfamiliar, chlorine, caustic soda, and hydrogen are simultaneously produced through the electrolysis of salt in a fixed ratio of 1.0 ton of chlorine to 1.1 tons of caustic soda and 0.03 tons of hydrogen. This by-the-ton ratio is referred to as an electrochemical unit (ECU). Through this division, Olin has production capacity of ~5.8 million ECUs. The basic input costs in production consist of electricity, salt, ethylene, and methanol.\\n \\n\\n Source: Company Presentation Chlorine is a raw material ubiquitous in many end-products including PVC pipe, vinyls, urethanes, epoxy, water treatment chemicals, as well as other organic and inorganic chemicals. About 25% of chlorine demand comes from housing construction. Caustic soda is found in water treatment chemicals, alumina, pulp and paper, urethanes, detergents, and a variety of other organic and inorganic chemicals. In addition to being a fuel source, hydrogen is used in the production of hydrogen peroxide and hydrochloric acid. Owing to chlor alkali\\'s co-production dynamic, strong demand for one product could result in the oversupply of another. Olin competes primarily with Occidental Petroleum (OXY) and Westlake Chemical (WLK) in chlor alkali. Because chlorine, caustic soda, and ethylene dichloride are commodity chemicals, their prices are more volatile vis a vie specialty chemicals which are contracted on a situational basis and are not available from many suppliers. As a result, Olin\\'s profitability is subject to commodity chemical pricing cyclicality, which is usually a function of economic activity, especially construction. A $10/ton change in the price of chlorine results in a ~$10 million impact to the company\\'s full year (FY) EBITDA; a $10/ton change in the price of caustic soda has a $30 million effect on FYEBITDA; and a $0.01 per pound change in the price of ethylene dichloride impacts Olin\\'s FYEBITDA by ~$20 million. On the input side, a $0.01/gallon hike in the price of ethylene drops FYEBITDA by ~$3 million. The Chlor Alkali Products and Vinyls division was responsible for revenue of ~$3.0 billion and $867.6 million of Adj. EBITDA (before consideration for corporate overhead) during 3Q18YTD, representing ~56% and ~84% of totals, respectively.\\n \\n\\n Source: Company Presentation Epoxy. The company\\'s Epoxy division is responsible for the manufacture and sale of allyl chloride, epichlorohydrin, and epoxy resins as well as downstream products such as marine coatings, wind turbine blades, and water purification products. This segment accounted for 3Q18YTD revenue of ~$1.8 billion and $110.8 million of Adj. EBITDA, representing ~34% and 11% of totals, respectively. Winchester. The balance of Olin\\'s business is generated by its Winchester division, which sells sporting and small caliber military ammunition and components, and industrial cartridges. Winchester generated 3Q18YTD revenue of $511 million and Adj. EBITDA of $49 million, or 10% and 5% of totals, respectively. Approach: Olin\\'s strategy is to leverage the size of its leading production capabilities and its extensive logistics and terminal network to be the lowest cost chlor-alkali producer in the business. One example of this approach is its favorable ethylene arrangement with DowDuPont, which consists of a series of three pipeline supply agreements that mitigate operational and start-up risks. 3Q18 Results and Outlook: On October 29th, 2018, Olin reported 3Q18 Adj. net income of $0.66 per diluted share on revenue of $1.87 billion versus $0.31 per share on revenue of $1.55 billion in 3Q17. Earnings came in $0.09 worse than expectations while revenues beat the Street consensus by ~$70 million. An unfavorable product mix and lower 3Q18 domestic and export caustic soda pricing were partially to blame for the Adj. earnings miss. It should be noted that caustic soda export pricing has been negatively influenced by a prolonged, flood-induced shutdown at the Alunorte alumina refinery in Brazil that first occurred in March 2018. With that said, 3Q18 Adj. EBITDA was $398.3 million versus $265.5 million in 3Q17 as the company benefitted from improved Y/Y caustic soda, chlorine, ethylene dichloride, and epoxy pricing that more than offset higher input costs and decreased shipments in the Winchester division. Highlighting the volatility in pricing, ethylene dichloride (output) pricing has more than doubled YTD, while ethane (input) costs jumped 60% in 3Q18 over its 1H18 average. Divisionally, Chlor Alkali Products, and Vinyls sales rose 19% Y/Y to $1.05 billion while Epoxy revenue jumped 32% to $647.3 million. Overall, 3Q18 Adj. EBITDA represented Olin\\'s highest in any quarter since the acquisition of the DowDuPont businesses.\\n Along with these results, management guided Adj. EBITDA lower for 2018 from $1.3 billion to $1.26 billion, citing higher ethylene (input) costs, lower caustic soda pricing, and decreased demand for commercial ammunition as responsible for an $85 million decrease in its outlook. If you are wondering why $85 million worth of 4Q18 EBITDA shortfalls only add to a $40 million overall revision, management\\'s explanation was lacking. Either way, 4Q18E Adj. EBITDA will be down sequentially from 3Q18. Even with this dimmer outlook for the balance of the year, Olin is bullish longer-term on caustic soda pricing as net chlor alkali capacity reductions in North America, Europe, and China since 2016 combined with no meaningful capacity additions expected over the next two to three years should result in historically high operating rates to meet an expected increase in demand. If management is wrong and caustic soda prices remain depressed at current levels, Adj. EBITDA will be negatively impacted by ~$100 million in 2019 versus 2018. The company is also optimistic on epoxy pricing as it expects demand growth to outstrip global GDP. Chlorine pricing is also expected to improve with any downtick likely dampened by the addition of end users the company added with its DowDuPont businesses purchase. Before the transaction, Olin had three categories of end users; today it has nineteen. If chlorine prices remain at 4Q18 levels, it would create a $60-$75 million Adj. EBITDA tailwind in 2019 versus 2018. Longer term, management expects ECU demand to increase by ~10 million tons over the next five years while only ~2 million tons of supply come online over the same period. Based on these assumptions, Olin believes it can achieve $1.5 billion of Adj. EBITDA in the next two years. Balance Sheet & Analyst Commentary: Olin\\'s balance sheet showed $156.7 million of cash and $3.3 billion of debt at September 30th, 2018. The company paid down ~$250 million of debt during the first nine months of 2018. The cash line got a bump when a $120 million receivable for environmental insurance recoveries was received in October 2018. Net Debt to Adj. EBITDA is currently 2.5x. Management indicated that debt reduction will be a priority with a goal of reducing its leverage ratio to 2.0x\\'s sometime in 2019.\\n The board authorized a buyback of $500 million early in 2018, of which it has so far purchased ~500,000 shares, leaving $483.2 million remaining. The company currently pays a $0.20 quarterly dividend for a current yield of ~3.9%, its most recent dividend marked 92 years of consecutive quarterly distributions. Analysts have a mixed opinion of Olin as reflected by analysts\\' eight buys or outperforms and two holds. 2019 earnings estimates have dropped considerably since management guided 4Q18 expectations downward. At $2.63 about in October, the mean 2019 fully diluted net income per share is now estimated at just over $2.20 a share. Analysts\\' current median twelve-month price target is just under $30.00 a share. Board member Donald Bogus has a more optimistic outlook for Olin based on his November 2nd, 2018 purchase of 25,000 shares at $21.87. Three other officers or directors have made small buys totally approximately $135,000 since then as well. Verdict: Management lowered its near-term forecast during its last earnings call but claiming that due to longer-term supply/demand dynamics, this drop is only temporary. Management believes that chlor alkali cyclicality will be replaced by a protracted uptrend in pricing with possibly less volatility. Whether this scenario plays out remains to be seen. What is clear is Olin\\'s stock is off some 50% since its January 2018 highs and analysts\\' 2019 earnings estimates have been revised ~15% lower since Q3 results as hand-wringing continue over the outlook for the construction market. The stock is trading at under 9x\\'s 2019E EPS, 5x\\'s EV/Adj. 2018E EBITDA, and less ~.45x\\'s 2019E Sales, which collectively suggests that investors are not buying into Olin\\'s outlook. In addition, thanks to its decline in 2018, the stock yields have just over a four percent yield. This should provide some sort of floor against further declines. I have purchased a \\'watch item\\' position in Olin for my own personal account as the stock looks cheap from a longer-term basis and pays a nice dividend while awaiting a turnaround. The stock also looks like it is trying to put in a bottom in recent weeks. However, now that the House has turned over in the mid-terms, gun makers could come under additional scrutiny. While Winchester is a small part of Olin\\'s business, the company could have some \\'headline\\' risk in the coming months nonetheless. Therefore, I would not consider it a \\'core\\' holding at this time.\\n The fascination of shooting as a sport depends almost wholly on whether you are at the right or wrong end of the gun.\" - P.G.

This bodes well for Kinder Morgan.'], 'article': [\"By Aristofanis Papadatos Since it peaked, in early October, Kinder Morgan (KMI) has plunged 20%. Consequently, it is now trading near the all-time lows it reached almost three years ago, when it decimated its dividend. As the company is in much better shape now than it was back then, the big question is whether the stock has become a bargain. Business Overview Kinder Morgan is one of the 294 dividend-paying energy stocks. It has the largest natural gas transmission network, transporting approximately 40% of all the natural gas consumed in the U.S. It is also the largest independent transporter of petroleum products and the largest terminal operator in North America. The recent plunge of the stock has resulted from two factors. After an almost decade-long bull market, S&P entered into bear market territory this week. The plunge of the index this month has affected the vast majority of the stocks. In addition, the peak of Kinder Morgan in early October almost coincided with the peak of the oil price. Since then, the price of oil has collapsed, from $75 to $43. This dive has taken its toll on the stock price of Kinder Morgan. However, Kinder Morgan is much less dependent on the oil price than most energy companies. It operates with a fee-based model and signs long-term contracts with its customers, which are forced to pay pre-determined amounts to Kinder Morgan even if they actually transport lower volumes than expected. Thanks to this business model, 96% of the cash flows of Kinder Morgan are either fee-based or hedged. Moreover, management has provided sensitivity figures, which show how much the cash flows of the company are affected by a change in the price of oil and natural gas. For every $1 per barrel decrease in the price of oil, the distributable cash flow [DCF] decreases by only $7M. Management has provided guidance for DCF of $4.6B for this year, based on an average oil price of $56.5. As this year has approached its end, this year’s results will not be affected much by the recent decline of the oil price. In 2019, if we assume an average oil price around $43 as a worst-case scenario, the annual DCF will decrease by only $0.1B or 2%. Therefore, the dramatic move of the stock price of Kinder Morgan seems overblown, at least on the surface.\\n Growth U.S. oil producers have proved resilient even amid suppressed oil prices in recent years. The total U.S. oil production has reached record levels this year and is expected by EIA to climb to new all-time highs, around 12.0M barrels per day in 2019. Moreover, the U.S. production of natural gas is expected to grow by 40% over the next decade, in tandem with the demand growth. The sustained increase in the U.S. production of oil and natural gas will be a major growth driver for Kinder Morgan in the upcoming years. Debt The debt load is a major issue for Kinder Morgan. The company invested heavily in numerous growth projects for years but it also distributed extremely generous dividends during those years. As a result, it accumulated a huge amount of debt and was forced to slash its dividend by 75% almost three years ago. Since Kinder Morgan cut its dividend, it has somewhat improved its balance sheet. Its net debt (as per Buffett, net debt = total liabilities – cash – receivables) has dropped from $47.2B in 2014 to $40.6B in the most recent quarter. Moreover, the company has reduced its leverage (debt/EBITDA) to 4.6 and expects to fund next year’s dividend and most capital expenses via its cash flows. Furthermore, it has not issued new shares in the last three years and has received positive outlook from the rating agencies. Overall, Kinder Morgan has moved in the right direction and has thus reduced its leverage. On the other hand, its interest expense still consumes essentially half of its operating income and hence the company still has a long way to go to reduce its risk exposure. In addition, while no debt matured this year, the company has a heavy schedule of debt maturities over the next four years, with about $2.5 B of debt maturing every year on average. \\n\\n\\n Source: Investor Presentation This loaded schedule of debt maturities will limit the financial flexibility of Kinder Morgan and will be a significant burden in the upcoming years, particularly if interest rates remain on the rise, as the company will have to roll over a great portion of this debt. Valuation As Kinder Morgan has provided guidance for DCF around $2.05 per share this year, it is now trading at a price-to-DCF ratio of 7.2. This is a markedly cheap valuation level. On the one hand, the market is justified to punish the stock for its high debt load. On the other hand, if the company continues to strengthen its balance sheet in the upcoming years, its valuation will revert to more reasonable levels, around 10.0, and hence the stock will enjoy a boost, not only from growing DCF, but also from the expansion of its valuation level. Final Thoughts  Since Kinder Morgan slashed its dividend, in early 2016, it has been moving in the right direction. It has slowly improved its financial position and is poised to grow its cash flows thanks to the exciting prospects of the U.S. production of oil and natural gas. On the other hand, as a bear market has just begun (and there's no telling if it will be over in a week or 3 years), we prefer not to recommend purchasing Kinder Morgan due to its still high leverage. The collapse of the oil price and the onset of a bear market have resulted in extreme beating of several other energy stocks. Exxon Mobil (XOM) is currently offering a 5.0% dividend yield, which is somewhat lower than the 5.4% yield of Kinder Morgan, but Exxon Mobil has a rock-solid balance sheet. Moreover, Magellan Midstream Partners (MMP), an exemplary midstream LP, is offering a 7.2% yield and has a much stronger balance sheet than Kinder Morgan. Overall, while Kinder Morgan is attractively valued, we advise investors to look at other energy stocks, which are more attractive right now.\\nDisclosure: I am/we are long XOM.

Pure EVs (BEV, battery-electric vehicles) accounted for 41% of all car sales in Norway in November 2018, and plug-in hybrids (PHEVs) added another 16%, for a total of 57% of the market: EV Sales. No other country comes close. As I am writing this, just before Midnight Norway time on Dec. 27, there are obviously a few short days left this quarter. It's impossible to say what residual sales are going to be in these final four days, but consider that what’s left beyond Friday is a weekend - when traditionally few new cars are registered in Norway and New Year’s Eve. Looking at the daily registration statistics, very few electric cars are registered on weekends in Norway. Eyeballing the statistics I grab from this site - Registreringer av nye elbiler i Norge - every day, there are usually 300-400 EVs registered per weekday, but only 20-50 per day on a weekend. One senses that’s more of an administrative spillover than anything else. Also, for Dec. 24, 25 and 26 almost zero EVs were registered in Norway, per the reference site cited above. The market awoke on Dec. 27 with 197 units registered on the day, when I took the temperature a bit after 9 p.m. local Norway time. The point of the nuance described above is to say this: It doesn’t look like the remaining selling days in December will change the numbers you are about to see below, to any material extent. Obviously anything remains possible, including a big potential fleet sale in which an automaker could sell 200 or whatever cars to a rental car company, a taxi fleet, or something like that. We shall see whether that happens or not. But retail sales don’t look like they will move these numbers materially before the year ends.\\n Norway is an important market for Tesla (TSLA) for two reasons. To date since inception, Tesla has sold 19,812 Model S units and 11,147 Model X units. So that’s approximately 30,000 in total. This year, it sold 3,682 Model S and 4,946 units. That’s the first reason. The second reason is that Norway is the bellwether market for electric cars. Other than just the 41% BEV market share discussed above, it's important for two other reasons:  Unlike markets such as The Netherlands, there was no recent, and will be no imminent, major change in EV subsidies in Norway. Therefore, there have not been any - and will not be any in 2019 - major distortions in sales statistics, as people buy more or fewer EVs in advance on a change in subsidies. The Norwegian numbers therefore more accurately reflect real market trends. Because Norway is by far the leader in EV sales, it gets priority for new models coming to market. The public also is more educated on EVs, and has therefore become the worldwide EV trendsetter.  With all that said, let’s see how Tesla did in Norway’s Q4 (through Dec. 27) and compare with the prior year:                  2018 Q4 Norway 2018 Oct 2018 Nov Dec 1-27 2018 Q4 Q/Q change 2017 Oct 2017 Nov 2017 Dec 2017 Q4   1 Nissan LEAF 1629 1529 891 4049 162% 646 556 345 1547   2 VW eGolf 1145 1074 907 3126 32% 1235 488 649 2372   3 BMW i3 595 786 463 1844 31% 462 408 539 1409   4 Tesla Model X 123 250 980 1353 -34% 130 497 1430 2057   5 Renault Zoe 426 481 308 1215 84% 21 218 423 662   6 Hyundai Ioniq 292 587 330 1209 96% 176 246 194 616   7 Kia Soul 381 262 285 928 -22% 393 481 316 1190   8 Jaguar i-Pace 443 341 165 949 N/A 0 0 0 0   9 Tesla Model S 86 215 596 897 -47% 165 502 1033 1700   10 Hyundai Kona 54 134 176 364 N/A 0 0 0 0     TOTAL TOP 10 5174 5659 5101 15934 38% 3228 3396 4929 11553                             Others (11-lower) 582 737 542 1861 25% 551 566 369 1486     TOTAL NORWAY 5756 6396 5643 17795 36% 3779 3962 5298 13039                             TESLA TOTAL 209 465 1576 2250 -40% 295 999 2463 3757     Jaguar 443 341 165 949 N/A 0 0 0 0                             Tesla loss       1507               Jaguar % of loss       63%             Source: Registreringer av nye elbiler i Norge As you can see in the table above, here are the four main points you need to understand from this table, as it pertains to how Tesla lost market share to one car in particular:  Tesla’s sales are down 40% this quarter, compared to Q4 a year ago. Obviously that number will shrink by perhaps at least 1% in the remaining days of December, but it probably won’t be a material number for all the reasons discussed above. This Tesla decline was 1,507 units (3,757 minus 2,250). Jaguar entered the market in the fall of 2018 (zero sales in 2017) and posted 949 units for the quarter to date. 949 units of Jaguar sales is 63% of Tesla’s decline (1,507) units.  Obviously nobody can say for sure that Tesla lost all of those 949 units to Jaguar (TTM). In fact, they probably didn’t. Some Tesla losses went to other EVs as well. However, I can make a good case as to why it’s probably a good assumption that Tesla lost these sales primarily to Jaguar. The reason is simply this: Jaguar i-Pace is the only new car in the market in the same price and performance class as Tesla. All the other cars are far less expensive cars, with less horsepower and no all-wheel drive: Nissan (OTCPK:NSANY), Volkswagen (OTCPK:VLKAF), BMW (OTCPK:BMWYY), Renault (OTC:RNSDF), Kia (OTCPK:KIMTF) and Hyundai (OTCPK:HYMLF) - all of them, without exception. In fact, when you consider the totality of the picture in Norway, Q4 was a total disaster for Tesla. The BEV market as a whole was up 36% (top 10 sellers were up 38%), but Tesla was down 40%. If that is not the definition of disaster, I don’t know what is. Instead, the Jaguar i-Pace showed up and grabbed 5% of the entire Norwegian BEV market in Q4 - 949 units out of 17,795. This new market entrant - the first to go up directly against Tesla in the luxury BEV segment - posted a number that constituted 63% of Tesla’s reduction in sales. Of course, as I said above, we can’t say for sure that Jaguar took this 5% market share from Tesla, but c’mon - this is about as clear a trace as one could possibly make it, without having photographic evidence and sworn statements by the people who bought the Jaguar. The fingerprints are very damning here, as I think should be obvious to anyone.\\n I could have waited almost a week to publish this article, and the final numbers will naturally shift these numbers by a hair. However, the value of this article is to a large extent that you are likely getting to almost 99% of the final answer, a few days early, given the sleepy holidays that remain this year. The investment conclusion for Tesla here is this: When the first direct competitor showed up in the world’s most advanced electric car market, Tesla’s sales dropped 40%. If that’s the impact of the Jaguar i-Pace, then what do you think the impact will be when Audi (OTCPK:AUDVF) starts deliveries of the eTron in Q1 2019? By all accounts, Audi (OTCPK:VLKAF) is a far bigger brand than Jaguar in this part of Europe, including having more dealerships. One final word about the Tesla Model 3: I know what you are going to say - the Model 3 is coming, and Tesla’s CEO has promised its arrival on European soil in February 2019. It obviously looks to become a strong seller among the electric cars. There is no question that it will help Tesla’s sales at that time. However, keep in mind that there are two additional factors that kick into place in the first half of 2019 as well:  If Tesla loses Model S and X sales to new competitors from Jaguar and Audi, it will take even more Model 3 units to make up for the lost margin on those more expensive vehicles. Audi and Jaguar won’t be the only new entrants in the market. In terms of less expensive cars, the Kia Niro and revised 230-mile range Kia Soul will enter the market in Q1 as well. Then, by June 2019, the Nissan LEAF with its new 230 mile range battery also will be in the market. Those will compete against Tesla Model 3 - not so much the Model S and X.  Conclusion: The Model 3 will help Tesla’s sales in Europe. However, the competitive wall is coming up fast, and it already had a huge impact in Q4.

The question is whether this weakness is likely to continue.It is of the author's opinion that USD/JPY is likely to fall further than its recent lows of around 110. A short to medium term target could be 109.This prediction rests on the fact that the pair has showed no ability to surpass 114 in recent times.Since the beginning of 2017, a failure to achieve a sustained break over the 114 level has invariably resulted in a return to a price under 109 in the subsequent short to medium term.While this time it may be different, the author believes that the current base case for USD/JPY is a return to under 109 within the next one to four weeks.\"], 'article': [\" In a recent article published December 19, 2018, I warned that USD/JPY had further room to fall. Very shortly after the article, USD/JPY dropped below my downside target of 111.750, without showing any positive retracement to the upside beforehand. Now, at the (present) time of writing, the USD/JPY pair is currently trading in the region of 111.000, after having fallen to a low of 110.269 on Christmas Eve (on December 24, 2018). The USD/JPY pair often serves as a useful, leading indicator for equities and other asset classes (by virtue of signaling risk-on activity when the pair is positive). It is therefore once again pertinent to ask: what is next for USD/JPY? In the author's view, it is probable that the pair finds it way lower; with an initial target of 109.000. Key Levels for USD/JPY The near-term, daily chart for USD/JPY probably does not provide us with enough information to make any prediction as to the pair's future direction, at least not with much conviction. The daily chart below shows that the pair has recently hit similar lows to the intraday low of 110.380 achieved previously on September 7, 2018 (marked by the black line). \\n\\n\\n (The chart above was created by the author using TradingView.com charting tools. This also supplies to any other chart images presented hereafter.) This level of 110.380 seems to line up well with the recent lows, but will this level likely provide support for USD/JPY? Will the pair now bounce and rise ardently, saving the pair from falling further? It is of the author's opinion that the answer to all these questions is no; negative. Instead, a more likely scenario is that USD/JPY drops to 109.000 (or lower). USD/JPY Could Be Targeting 109 Firstly, note that the pair has already approached 110.000, a round number. Round numbers are often used as targets, not just by traders, but by institutions who are looking to process large currency transactions. And it is precisely institutional order flow that we must keep in mind when predicting currency pair movements. While the pair has not actually recently met 110.000, we should put the recent bearishness in the pair in context of the fact that the pair has already failed several times to sustain itself above 114.500. As depicted in the chart below, in the red highlighted area, USD/JPY has not demonstrated sufficient lift. It is precisely the lower highs shown in this highlighted area that I warned of previously. \\n\\n In the author's view, it is unlikely that the USD/JPY pair attempts these levels again any time soon. If the pair does try for these levels, the price would unlikely hold. It seemed logical for the price to fall. Yet now that it has fallen to almost 110.000, could it fall further? We return to the question at hand. The answer to the question of whether USD/JPY could fall to 110.000 and below becomes immediately clearer when viewing the above chart on the longer-term, weekly chart. Notice that since the beginning of 2017, each time USD/JPY approached or exceeded the 114.000 level, it invariably returned at some point (in the short to medium term) to at least 108.802 (or lower).\\n The chart below illustrates this, by not only keeping the previous illustrations provided in the above charts, but by also marking the levels of 114.000 in red, and 108.802 in dark green. (It is also a weekly chart, as mentioned before.) \\n\\nIt is for this reason that we can reasonably estimate that the next target for USD/JPY is approximately 108.802. Given the recent performance of USD/JPY, combined with the far less fervent risk sentiment demonstrated by equities and other risk-on assets most recently, it is very unlikely that USD/JPY breaks long-term highs beyond 114.000 any time soon. Therefore, the USD/JPY pair is likely to remain biased to the downside. The question then becomes, how far will the pair fall? And the logic presented heretofore would suggest that 108.802 is a probable target. While the pair may see further, minor retracements to the upside, the author believes that USD/JPY will meet with 108.802 within the next one to four weeks. As a side note, it is important to remember that divergences can occur between USD/JPY and equities. While further weakness in the USD/JPY pair could support further equity outflows (and thus equity under-performance), the positive correlation between the USD/JPY pair and equities do not always hold. This prediction therefore does not necessarily suggest that equities will also likely see downside in the near term. However, this prediction would encourage prudent cautiousness in all risk assets over the next four weeks, into the new year of 2019.

We think the company will be forced by shareholders to deleverage in 2019.'], 'article': ['Investment Thesis AT&T (T) owns a few slow and no-growth businesses that are far from exciting, but the company is a cash-generating machine. We think the company is currently being forced to deleverage by investors that worry about rising interest rates eroding their equity position in the coming years. We started a position because the stock currently pays investors 7.5% to wait for the turnaround. We think investors who waited patiently as we did will benefit from starting a position at current price levels. We bought when the stock started dipping below $30 and think AT&T is a $50 stock within the next 2-3 years.  A Rapidly Increasing Debt Pile It is no secret that with the federal reserve increasing interest rates, companies with weaker balance sheets have done worse than quality companies with strong balance sheets in 2018 overall. We think this trend will likely continue until companies that over-borrowed are forced to deleverage as interest rates rise. AT&T\\'s debt has increased by 86% from $186 billion in 2013 to just under $350 billion as of September 2018. The increase in debt is largely attributed to investment in building out the next generation 5G network and primarily by acquisitions such as the recent purchase of Time Warner, which was completed in 2018. AT&T also purchased DirecTV in 2015. In total AT&T spent about $150 billion for both acquisitions, which would explain about 90% of the debt that was added over the past five years. Both acquisitions have increases AT&T\\'s profitability but have so far not been loved by analysts who are concerned that acquisitions are distracting management and leading to undue financial risk. We are confident as CEO Randall Stephenson has clearly stated that discretionary cash is going to be used for one purpose, debt reduction. The liabilities in the chart below do not include liabilities such as pensions and capital lease obligations.\\n \\n\\n Source: AT&T Investor Day The Company is Growing? Right? The recent significant increases in Annual revenue have coincided with the closing of both the DirecTV and Time Warner acquisitions. It is expected that revenue will increase when a company purchases a new business with an existing customer base. What is sometimes hard to determine is just how the existing business would have grown without an acquisition? AT&T started bundling services after the DirecTV acquisition, which naturally made it difficult to determine if revenue growth in the core business was positive. AT&T held an investor day on November 29th, 2018, to help explain the new breakdown of the business and their growth plans post-litigation with the U.S. government. AT&T\\'s mobility business experienced 5% revenue growth in the third quarter and made up 48% of the companies EBITDA. AT&T is confident that consumers will continue to spend around $200-$300 per month on \"communications\" and this will generally grow with GDP. AT&T has committed to a dividend payout ratio of 50% or more but has expressed clearly that they can still invest many billions of dollars for future growth. We believe that with the strong cash flow that AT&T generates they can invest around 20 billion dollars each year for the foreseeable future without impacting the dividend payment.  \\n\\n Source: YCHARTS AT&T has the content  Many investors continue to focus on the cash cow mobility business even though AT&T has built an impressive content library. AT&T owns CNN as well as the DC properties such as Batman and Superman just to name a few. Even though the DC movies have not performed nearly as well as the Marvel movies, with the exception of Wonder Woman, DC is still a great asset that will eventually be turned around. AT&T is looking to build a direct to consumer platform to rival the likes of Netflix because they have such a strong content asset base. We think AT&T will continue to license legacy Time Warner content but will be able to leverage scale to build a good platform. AT&T is in a better position to build a full direct-to-consumer content suite with their existing assets. Unlike Netflix, which does not have exposure to real-time news, for example, AT&Ts offering could flip a switch to offer real-time broadcast content direct to consumer.\\n \\n\\n Source: WarnerMedia A new way of thinking about AT&T Will investors trade AT&T stock based on the reviews for the latest Aquaman movie or the engagement with CNN compared to other broadcast news networks? We are in uncharted territory where the traditional business metrics matter in addition to new areas of opportunity. In our view, AT&T\\'s acquisition of new wireless spectrum is now as important as the performance of the upcoming Justice League follow up movie. And investors will need to adjust to this way of thinking. A lousy year at the box office could theoretically put a hold on dividend increases. AT&T has numerous assets, such as a minority stake in Hulu, which can be monetized over time and provide value to shareholders. We are in a transition period where AT&T\\'s business is no longer \"simple\" but also has hundreds of irons in the fire that will lead to future growth and value for shareholders. \\n\\n Source: AT&T Investor Day Mergers can take a while complete We think the management expectation of reducing general overhead and duplicate costs bt $1.5 billion is very reasonable. With AT&T folding up small and large organizations into the overall organization structure post-acquisition what once was two separate organizations (marketing, procurement, etc.) are rolled into one. Afterward, if headcount needs to be reduced, it can be done thoughtfully. This leads to tremendous scale and efficiency. Where we think AT&T may be taking a bit of a leap is with revenue synergies. We agree that cross-selling will be very important but on its own will not fix customers sensitivity to price and the trend of chord-cutting in the broadcast television space. Over the longer term if the merger is followed up thoughtfully, then the compound effect over time will be tremendous for shareholders. \\n \\n\\n Source: AT&T Investor Day Conclusion AT&T has a breathtaking number of assets and has evolved into more than just a mobility and communications business. AT&T is building out a robust content pipeline that will add value for years to come. We started a position because the stock currently pays investors 7.5% to wait for the turnaround. We think investors who waited patiently as we did will benefit from starting a position at current price levels. We bought when the stock started dipping below $30, and we think AT&T will be a $50 stock within the next 2-3 years.\\nDisclosure: I am/we are long T.

The purpose of this article is to update you on the recent streaming deal with Maverix Metals (OTCPK:MACIF) as well as the $8 million funds earned through a private stock placement. Both deals were aimed at cleaning up the debt on the balance sheet as well as providing cash for operations and some further exploration of the Moss mine area. I interviewed Kenneth Berry who is President, CEO, and a Director with the company. CFO Christopher Park and Communications Manager Chris Curran were also in attendance.  Here are some key takeaways from the interview. \\n\\nSource: Northern Vertex  Northern Vertex has retired the debt they had with Sprott. Maverix gives $20 million up front for the opportunity to purchase up to 3.5 million ounces of silver at 20% of the spot price. After those ounces are purchased, Maverix maintains the ability to purchase up to 50% of future silver production using the same terms. Both companies profit from the deal and it offers optionality on a potentially rising silver price for both parties. The $8 million private placement provides the company money to fund operations and should solidify the balance sheet for 2019 while the company works on optimizing the gold and silver recovery from their mine. \\n In addition to those points, Northern Vertex has options to increase exploration of the Moss mine area in the Oatman district with award winning exploration team Perry Durning and Bud Hillemeyer. \\n\\nSource: Northern Vertex In addition to the exploration upside, now that Northern Vertex has solidified their financial standing, the company is positioned to take advantage of possible expansion. Some research provided to the company shows the power of increasing both production rates and reserves in terms of market liquidity, higher market capitalization, and more analyst coverage. \\n\\nSource: Northern Vertex, Haywood Research Optionality Analysis for Maverix and Northern Vertex Here is my optionality analysis for both companies given different possible silver prices, including spot price as of time of writing the article.     Northern Vertex Project Feasibility, Moss Mine     Project Silver Ounces (M&I) 4,610,000   Silver Recovery Rate 65.00%   Recoverable Ounces, Initial 2,996,500   Gold Ounces (M&I) 377,000         Maverix Agreement     Tranche 1 Stream Ounces 3,500,000   Difference to be found through expanded exploration 503,500   Maverix spot-based payments ($14.81 silver spot as of 12-24-2018) $8,875,633.00   Initial Payment to Northern Vertex $20,000,000.00   Total Payments to Northern Vertex $28,875,633.00   Maverix Total Cost of Silver per ounce $9.64         Maverix Optionality Analysis     Silver @ $17.50/ounce, total project silver value $52,438,750.00   Maverix 20% spot payment $10,487,750.00   Maverix Total Cost of Silver per ounce $10.17   Northern Vertex – per gold ounce byproduct credit from silver stream $80.87         Silver Rises to $20/ounce (2016 high) $59,930,000.00   Maverix 20% spot payment $11,986,000.00   Maverix Total Cost of Silver $10.67   Northern Vertex – per gold ounce byproduct credit from silver stream $84.84         Silver Rises to $25/ounce $74,912,500.00   Maverix 20% spot payment $14,982,500.00   Maverix Total Cost of Silver $11.67   Northern Vertex – per gold ounce byproduct credit from silver stream $92.79   Source: My calculations Maverix is making out pretty well on this deal, staying under the current floor for the silver price. If silver price does rise substantially, Maverix's total cost of silver as a percent of the spot price falls precipitously. Northern Vertex gets immediate partial monetization of their silver and higher byproduct credits, per project gold ounce, as the price of silver rises. The original project feasibility study had the AISC (all in sustaining cost) of gold at $603 given the silver byproduct credits. Since this deal was put into place, we can expect the AISC to rise somewhat due to sharing the silver profits with Maverix. However, the project is still low cost with respect to the average gold mining costs found in the industry. And Northern Vertex just eliminated a lot of risk from their balance sheet by eliminating the Sprott debt and adding to their cash reserves. This move should provide plenty of runway to optimize their mine and get to their expected production rates without having to take on additional debt. What the Deal Says About Confidence in the Project The new financing shows that streaming companies such as Maverix Metals have confidence in the company to deliver on production targets. \\n\\nSource: Northern Vertex Maverix Metals has an established streaming agreement with Pan American Silver at La Colorada in Mexico and Endeavour Mining in Burkina Faso, so it is no stranger to making deals with strong, established precious metals mining companies. But Maverix's strategy also seems to be financing smaller development projects with solid price upside. In the case of this deal with Northern Vertex, they saw an opportunity to finance a new operator and obtain undervalued silver assets that give them a very cash flow positive optionality play on the upside price for silver. \\n The best time to make this deal was right after Northern Vertex began production, had some debts to pay for developing the mine, and had not delivered the bulk of the metals in the project yet. Further, the Maverix option includes total mine output well beyond the initial 2.99 million recoverable silver ounces. The agreement agrees to purchase 100% of silver ounces up to 3.5 million. Also, the deal gives Maverix the ability to purchase 50% of silver beyond the 3.5 million ounces, suggesting Maverix thinks there is more gold and silver to be found on the property, perhaps in the Western and Eastern extensions as shown in the graphic above. Maverix is not the only company that has shown confidence in Northern Vertex to produce on the project. Sprott had provided a $100 million line of credit initially which Nortern Vertex had drawn $20 million against. I am told by management that the possibility of further financing with Sprott, should the company want to expand, is still an option as they have maintained their positive relationship. Paying off the debt early and strengthening the balance sheet certainly helps the case if they needed to use that option. What are the Risks? The main risk that I took away from the conversation with Ken Berry was that Northern Vertex is not ready to estimate their current AISC. To be fair, they have not had enough production time to calculate actual production costs plus additional expenditures to expand operations. It will take more time for data to be made available to come up with a tangible, reliable AISC number. Further, he stated that the initial production costs of gold are above the feasibility number, which was $603 per gold ounce. I am not overly worried about that right now for two reasons: a) they are early in production, and it is not abnormal to have higher costs while operations are fine tuned and b) the AISC is so low that it could rise substantially and still be way below current gold spot price of $1271.70 at time of this writing.\\n However, there is still a risk that the costs are substantially higher than the feasibility study would indicate, which would drive the overall project value down. Northern Vertex's current market cap is currently valued well below their project NPV. The research provided in the graphic above from Haywood Research shows that overall sector market caps are priced within ranges and not tied directly to project NPVs, but more on sentiment indicators like analyst coverage and overall project size. Investors have not appeared to spent enough time in precious metals sector to appropriately value projects and make their bets. As the general stock market volatility continues into 2019, I believe investors will spend time analyzing their options and find that the precious metals markets are sorely undervalued. I believe this to be an arbitrage opportunity right now for smart value investors looking at cheaply priced assets, and perhaps licking their wounds from falling stock values in the wildly popular technology sector which has been punished since October. I think the market scenario has played into Northern Vertex's hands as it has allowed them to develop the mine largely unnoticed, while still showing the ability to finance their operations with two established industry partners who know how precious metals mining works. When the broad market takes notice of the sector, Northern Vertex will likely be one of the companies that catches some of that new investor money coming in due to their relatively low level risk factors. Stay Tuned We are much closer to the Renaissance in precious metals markets than we have been since the last major market crash. The macro story is playing into the hands of precious metals, and will reward the miners and investors with key positions. Therefore, for 2019 I will be adding coverage for more companies in the precious metals sector that I also believe are undervalued. And lastly, I will continue to provide coverage for Northern Vertex throughout 2019 as production continues to ramp up and major news events happen.\\n\\nDisclosure: I/we have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. And later, you will have the opportunity to ask questions during the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Please note that today’s call is being recorded and I will be standing by should you need any assistance.\\nIt is now my pleasure to turn the conference over to Virland Johnson. Please go ahead, sir.\\nVirland Johnson\\nThank you. Good afternoon, and welcome to the Live Ventures Incorporated fiscal year-end 2018 conference call.\\nToday, the company filed its Form 10-K for its fiscal year ended September 30, 2018 with the SEC. This filing can be found on our website www.liveventures.com in the Investor Relations section as well as on the SEC website at www.sec.gov.\\nMy name is Virland Johnson, Chief Financial Officer of Live Ventures Incorporated. And joining me today are Jon Isaac, Chief Executive Officer of Live Ventures Incorporated; and Rodney Spriggs, Chief Executive Officer of Vintage Stock, Inc. Please note that some of the remarks you will hear today may contain forward-looking statements about the company’s performance, as well, there may be forward-looking statements made during the Q&A session that follow our prepared remarks.\\nThese statements are neither promises nor guarantees, and there are a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those set forth in these forward-looking statements. Additional information concerning factors that could cause actual results to materially differ from those in these forward-looking statements is contained in our filing and periodic reports filed with the SEC, copies of which are available on our website or may be requested directly from the company. Forward-looking statements are made as of today’s date, and we do not undertake any obligation to update any forward-looking statements made during today’s call.\\nThank you to everyone joining us today for our fiscal year-end 2018 call. I would also like to express my appreciation to our management and associates of Live Ventures and subsidiaries for another great year.\\nDuring our call today, we will briefly cover our company’s operating and financial results for the year, and then answer your questions at the end of our comments. Some operating results and highlights for the fiscal year 2018.\\nThe company reported record annual revenue of $199.6 million, representing an increase of 31.3% over last year and fiscal 2018 earnings per basic share of $3.01. Hard-surface products revenue $17.9 million continues to grow now at 49.5% year-over-year. Hard-surface products gross profits were up 50.9% year-over-year due to increased sales efforts.\\nFor the year, gross profit was $74.2 million, which is up 18.6% from last year. In addition, our operating income was $10.8 million, compared to last year of $18.1 million and net income was $5.9 million, compared to $6.5 million last year.\\nFor the year, our gross profit margin was down to 37.2% and operating income margin was down to 5.4%. This compares to the prior year when our gross profit margin was 41.1% and operating income margin was 11.9%. Cost of new product, sales levels and mix of products negatively affected gross margins realized in the year for both Vintage and ApplianceSmart.\\nThe company finalized its purchase price allocation and fair value assessment regarding the ApplianceSmart acquisition and recognized a bargain purchase gain, net of deferred tax of $7.2 million.\\n\\nSubsequent to year-end on December 21, 2018, Marquis Industries sold two synthetic turf extrusion lines for $4.75 million, plus the book value of the raw material operating and packing inventories associated with the synthetic turf extrusion lines for a total purchase price of approximately $5.5 million, plus $0.10 per pound of nylon sold by the buyer during the 36 months period after December 21, 2018.\\nTax reform reduced the federal corporate income tax rate for the company from 35% to 21%. For the 12 months ended September 30, 2018, we recorded an additional $3 million of tax expense due to deferred tax asset revaluation.\\nAs of September 30, 2018, the company reported approximately $2 million of cash on hand, plus an additional $7.4 million of available credit under the company’s revolving lines of credit.\\nNet cash provided from operating activities for the 12 months ended September 30, 2018 was $11.8 million, an increase of 50.2%, or $3.9 million. Stockholders’ equity increased approximately 17.5% to $39.4 million over our year ended September 30, 2017.\\nIn June of 2018, the company successfully refinanced its Captiala term debt facility with a new term debt facility provided by Comvest at favorable interest rates. The company also negotiated a revised Texas Capital Bank revolving facility with an improved interest rate.\\nIn connection with the refinancing, the company charged-off $742,000 in unamortized debt issuance cost as interest expense. For additional financial information and details, I invite you to review our press release filed this morning and view our SEC filings on either our website or on the SEC’s website.\\nFor all those on the call, thank you very much for your participation on this call and your continued interest in Live Ventures Incorporated.\\nAt this time, we will take comments and questions from those that are on the call. Jon and I will – and Rodney will be standing by to answer them. So please use the system to announce if you have a question or not.\\nQuestion-and-Answer Session\\nOperator\\n[Operator Instructions]\\nJon Isaac\\nThis is Jon, question from Joseph.\\nUnidentified Analyst\\nHi, good afternoon. The quarter sounds or the year sounds really good and continues to look good. The company continues to look good. I just wonder about apparently people don’t know about the company. And while I don’t think it’s your job necessarily to spread the word about it, how does that happen? So that eventually, people do get interested in it and by people, I mean, mutual funds, other, they invest in public?\\nVirland Johnson\\nThat’s heavily a function of Investor Relations and that’s something that we continue to improve. Over the last couple of years, we’ve been focused mostly on the operations and building our balance sheet and our P&L. But that’s something that definitely we want to spend more effort and more resources and time in investing in this.\\nUnidentified Analyst\\nBut as I said, I don’t really think – I don’t necessarily want to see the company spending a lot of time and effort in that area. I think, you’re right. I think focusing on the company itself is the key and that eventually people will learn about it. I just wonder in general, how people find out, because there are so many companies that are out there, and – but pretty much answer that?\\nVirland Johnson\\nOne of the other things to consider is that, mutual funds and hedge funds that have hundreds of millions of dollars, billions of dollars, also don’t want to take huge stakes in companies that have a low valuation. So we’re sort of in this land where we’re not very valuable at this point.\\nBut I think, as you said, you’re right in time as we get bigger and our story becomes – people become more aware of our story, I think that more mutual funds would be – would take an interest. But I do believe that from the public filings that we do have Vanguard or a couple of other big names that have taken positions in our company. But I think some of them may be reluctant in taking the position that makes them a filer or greater than 4.9 or greater than 9.9 owners in the company.\\n\\nUnidentified Analyst\\nThank you.\\nVirland Johnson\\nThank you for your question.\\nOperator\\n[Operator Instructions]\\nVirland Johnson\\nIt’s been an exciting year, $200 million of revenue. I think a lot of investors, shareholders should realize that it was just a few years ago that our revenues was $3 million, $4 million, losing money, 11 employees, I think now we’re at $200 million profitable – we’ve been profitable for, I think, seven, eight consecutive quarters.\\nI think over 1,100 employees and counting, we’re also, for anyone that is on the call as well, we’re always looking for acquisitions. If you have any, we’re looking at a couple, as we speak. We think 2019 is going to be a good year. We’re excited.\\nJon Isaac\\nWe’re going to be opening up some new stores.\\nVirland Johnson\\nYes. Rodney, maybe you can give us a little bit about what you’re seeing on year-end, because your division represents almost half of the company’s revenues. Give us a snapshot of what you’re seeing, then we can take a question from JP?\\nRodney Spriggs\\nWell, so far we’ve had a good year. One of the things we invested in that, I believe was mentioned on last quarter’s call was the text messaging system that we had built, and that is so we have a better engagement with our customer base and we’re still operating with e-mails.\\nWe’re currently over 350,000 active text message customers and again, people on their cellphone are wanting the same anymore. So we’re seeing great returns on that, and we’re adding $10,000-plus per week. So that is still growing significantly. And some proof of that would have been the Labor Day sale that was the exact same sale we had in previous year, which is the big buy two get one free for our used product launch. And that sale on Labor Day was at 14% year-over-year same-store sales.\\nThe anniversary sale, the 1st week of November was over a 11% on same-store sales. And while our store sales will be slightly down, slightly up week-to-week, we’re getting these big pops and it is directly tied to that text messaging.\\nOne of the other things is, we were – Virland had mentioned about compressed margins a little bit, and a big part of that is the videogame cyclical nature. And we have huge sales in the PS4 even with some supply issues that is plugging the whole industry and all retailers on with Sony’s product. But that is starting to clear up. I think it’s a chip issue.\\nThe switch is very, very successful from Nintendo and is the number two seller and is very close to PS4 sales, and Xbox One is still Microsoft and Xbox really sales are good, but there is not much margin in those items. You sell them systems for $300. You make about $3 or $4 each. It’s about the long-term and it really hits the couple of years. Now we have a lot of used product that again, the margins are more in that 60% to 80% on used games and hardware.\\nSo we see a bright future. We like with the way that the direction is on the video game, which has been a little bit of a lag for us. But it looks like it’s going to be really good here in the next couple of years.\\nVirland Johnson\\nOne of the biggest milestones for Vintage this year was the refinance of a term loan that was expensive and that we replaced with Comvest. So that was really good for Vintage. We also have a few store openings on the horizon, Rodney, I think, in the next year what you think, maybe four, maybe more potentially for 2019?\\nRodney Spriggs\\nWe – which would not be a part of this reporting period, but we did open two locations: one in Columbia, Missouri and one in Tyler, Texas in November, so those are currently operating. It looks like they will be profitable from day one. Good lease prices on those and then sales came out the gate really strong.\\nAs per our agreement with Comvest, we can do three stores between now and September and then we can do four stores next year, but there is also the possibility that we could request to do additional stores if they keep performing like they are as we open up.\\n\\nJon Isaac\\nThe Comvest loan has helped us save significant amounts in interest expense. And in addition to that, we’ve been aggressively paying down that principal loan, I think, to the tune of about $3 million or so per year. They also have the cash suite. So this holiday period, there might be some there. Let’s take a question from JP.\\nUnidentified Analyst\\nHi, guys, how are you?\\nJon Isaac\\nGood. How are you, JP?\\nUnidentified Analyst\\nDoing well. First, couple of questions, I guess for Virland. One – and I haven’t been able to look at the 10-K. But last quarter, it looks like there’s – maybe a charge-off for write-down on the Vintage division. Is that right? Maybe just tune of about about $2 million. Is that correct, or is that product-specific, or walk me through that if you don’t mind?\\nVirland Johnson\\nI don’t think, we made any charge-offs in the Vintage division last quarter.\\nUnidentified Analyst\\nOkay. What were the financials on the Vintage division for the last quarter, compared to this, and then I guess?\\nVirland Johnson\\nWe don’t necessarily report that specifically in Q4. Vintage’s numbers are very comparable. The revenues are up year-over-year. Gross margin, as Rodney indicated earlier, is down a little bit, mainly because of the margin on new products and has slipped a little bit. But again, the business is very healthy and doing well. So I would look – I would may be having a look at our revenues by product line and gross profits by product line, and that will give you a real feel for how Vintage is doing.\\nUnidentified Analyst\\nOkay. And then on the ApplianceSmart acquisition, again, it may be in this 10-K. But can you walk us through the terms of that acquisition?\\nVirland Johnson\\nTerms were originally a note to Appliance Recycling Centers of America, Inc. It was a due to do from a amount and then it converted to a note. And then ApplianceSmart we paid or paid a little over $2.5 million on the principal between December 30 and Q3. And now that note is accruing interest and is currently not due for another couple of years.\\nUnidentified Analyst\\nOkay. What is the total balance on the note?\\nVirland Johnson\\nIt’s about $3.8 million.\\nUnidentified Analyst\\nOkay, all right, and thank you so much. And then my last question, I’ll hang up and thank you guys for taking my questions. The – I guess, the bargain basement for 2018 or for fiscal year, what – all the way were there two bargain basement that flow through the income statement, or what is the total amount of the bargain basement, I guess, upgrade, if you will, to the finance?\\nJon Isaac\\nIt was in two steps and then there was a brief adjustment in Q4 due to audit. But the total bargain purchased gain was $7.2 million.\\nUnidentified Analyst\\nOkay.\\nJon Isaac\\nAnd that only applied to ApplianceSmart, it didn’t apply to any other entity.\\nUnidentified Analyst\\nOkay. So it’s just the ApplianceSmart, and that were fully reflected in the EPS number?\\nVirland Johnson\\nYes.\\nUnidentified Analyst\\nOkay. All right. Thanks, guys.\\nVirland Johnson\\nWe also took one-time non-cash expenses such as the deferred tax asset revaluation. There was a couple of positive hits and negative hits.\\nUnidentified Analyst\\nYes.\\nJon Isaac\\nThank you for your questions.\\nUnidentified Analyst\\nSure. And what does those net outreach, Jon?\\nJon Isaac\\nWell, we took a $3 million hit on income taxes due to reval of the deferred tax assets. At the beginning of the year, if everybody remembers this, we had a fairly substantial deferred tax assets to the NOLs that have been carried over.\\nWhen cash – the Tax Act came into being in December, we have to reval those. And the total revaluation effect for the year is right at $3 million. That hit has fully baked into our EPS numbers in the P&L. Offsetting that, we had about $7.2 million of pickup on bargain purchase. But we also have a lot of expenses related to ApplianceSmart that we’ve had to absorb in making the transition into those numbers that are also fully baked in our P&L.\\n\\nSo we don’t really see once – we see the gain there, but it’s offset by some other things that are largely a wash for us. But since we’re on the topic of ApplianceSmart, I just want to mention something. I mean, the Marquis Industries is doing phenomenal. I think, it’s breaking records, sometimes months, sometimes every month. Vintage is doing really good.\\nThe growth prospects on Vintage looks good. ApplianceSmart is not doing so good, but we are in the middle of fixing some issues related to high cost, high-overhead and we may close some stores that are just not – that are contributing negatively to the bottom line. So, right now, we are devoting a lot of time and attention on an ApplianceSmart. But we think the turnaround will be good and no promises. But this is our main focus right now.\\nVirland Johnson\\nThe other thing, I think, shareholders should be aware of is that, the synthetic point from our key was the lowest margin-producing line that we had at Marquis. And by selling that line off, it’s going to even help Marquis numbers even more.\\nUnidentified Analyst\\nRight. Thanks, guys.\\nJon Isaac\\nThank you.\\nVirland Johnson\\nThank you.\\nOperator\\n[Operator Instructions]\\nJon Isaac\\nI think it’s important for shareholders to understand a synthetic turf sale that closed recently. So didn’t happen in the fiscal year, it happened. The subsequent event, we – that was disclosed in the 10-K, but that synthetic turf line was sold to some other company for about, what, 5.5 million.\\nVirland Johnson\\n$5.5 million?\\nJon Isaac\\n$5.5 million in cash, and that helped us payoff some term loans, but about half of that sale price went towards just cash and availability under our line of credit at Marquis. And then in addition to that, there was a consulting agreement that was signed between Marquis and the buyer of this equipment.\\nSo from a bottom line perspective, I think, it will be a neutral. But it does bring in some new cash that we can really redeploy. In the month of July, we also announced Mr. Wes Godfrey was appointed CEO at Marquis. We announced in February our new $10 million repurchase program that we’ve been excited about. Any other questions?\\nOperator\\nAnd it does look like we have any further questions on the phone line at this time.\\nUnidentified Analyst\\nMaybe, Jon, give investors some – your views for 2019?\\nJon Isaac\\nAs I mentioned, we’re very excited for 2019. We’re looking at the two potential prospects that I believe we may be able to – there’s a good chance that we may be able to make both acquisitions, both of them would be sort of a bolt-on for our existing platform companies.\\nSo we’re very excited about those. We’re focused on addressing the concerns of the ApplianceSmart and potentially two other acquisitions. But we also look at acquisitions on a weekly basis. They come across our desk and we get them from all sorts of places, investment bankers. We get them from private sellers, people who want to sell to us directly.\\nSo we look at those and we’re very careful as to who we proceed with and we have a certain criteria and we had here by it. So we may not have a year, where we have a lot of acquisitions, but some of the years it may offset. But our goal is usually one good acquisition, maybe two acquisitions per year, and we think it’s a long-term that Live will be a very healthy company as it is now and as shown historically, where we’ve taken the company in just the last few years.\\nOperator\\n[Operator Instructions]\\nJon Isaac\\nLet’s take the call from Alan [ph] – question from Alan.\\nUnidentified Analyst\\nHello. This is [indiscernible] actually. I was cut off and – for the first five minutes before the Q&A and missed your main presentation. Could you give me a 30-second summary of that first five minutes of your presentation?\\n\\nJon Isaac\\nYou missed the presentation. Yes, at a high-level, I’ll just coke the – maybe the bullet points from the press release. Our revenues were around $200 million. I’ll have Virland.\\nVirland Johnson\\nYes. Revenues are up about $200 million, 31.3%; our gross profits at $74.2 million, up 18.6%; our basic EPS is at $3.01; and our non-GAAP EBITDA is up to $25 million, up 7.8% year-over-year; assets are at $141.5 million. It was a growth year for us and we’re looking to grow into 2019. I will say the one thing that stands out the most is our operating cash flow that grew over 50% year-over-year. We’re almost at $12 million or something.\\nJon Isaac\\nYes. Okay. What else can we answer for you?\\nUnidentified Analyst\\nThat’s good. Thank you.\\nJon Isaac\\nAll right. Thank you. We’ll end the call if there’s no other questions get someone next 15 seconds to.\\nVirland Johnson\\nWe will be back to you in 45 days.\\nJon Isaac\\nYes, for the next for the…\\nVirland Johnson\\nFor the Q1 call.\\nJon Isaac\\n…first quarter. We do have another question from [San Thiago] [ph] San Thiago?\\nUnidentified Analyst\\nHello, Jon, can you hear me?\\nJon Isaac\\nYes, we can hear you.\\nUnidentified Analyst\\nYes. So my question was in regards to the liberation of the company, right? So my question was, have you considered increasing the share repurchases instead of acquisition?\\nJon Isaac\\nWe have been active in acquiring back shares whenever we can. Remember that the company just like us individually, we have blackout periods. And in addition to that, we cannot buy back stock if we’re in possession of material nonpublic information. So we strictly adhere to, of course, these rules. But when we are able to, we do buy on the open market. I believe the figure that I looked at recently in the 10-K yesterday was we acquired – we repurchased 142,000 since the start of the repurchase program. 142,000 shares, which represents approximately maybe 5% of the company just round figures.\\nSo yes, and now I believe we acquired stock at around – last year around $10 a share, now we’re at 30% less, despite the fact that we are stronger from a balance sheet perspective. Our cash flow has increased and we have a lot more on the horizon. So yes, we do look at Live Ventures and of itself as a potential acquisition in terms of buying incremental amounts of it back, and we had been successful in the past.\\nUnidentified Analyst\\nAll right. Thank you very much.\\nJon Isaac\\nOn that note actually, Virland, I get a lot of questions from investors who say, how come why the stock down, why the stock up? We really can’t comment on why the market behaves the way it does. I mean, if you look at the market as a whole three weeks ago was 30%, 40%, 50% more valuable. So it’s – the market as a whole has been down, but we take it a day at a time and we’re building the company for the long haul.\\nAnd whenever the opportunity presents itself and our stock is sold at a rate that we believe is good, we take advantage of it and we buy it back. So we’ve made it very, very clear to the investment community that we are and we will be buying shares in our company as we see fit and we’ve proven that. And I believe in 2019, we will be probably aggressively doing that. So we’ll see where we are a few months from now.\\nVirland Johnson\\nWell, thank you. We look forward to talking with you again in about 45 days to talk to Q1. Thank you for your participation on the call, those of you that asked questions and thank you for you – to the investors that are listening to the call. We’ll talk to you again soon.\\nJon Isaac\\nThank you.\\nVirland Johnson\\nThank you.\\nOperator\\nThis does conclude today’s program. Thank you for your participation. You may disconnect at any time.']}\n"

While rising interest rates is a positive factor for banks, interest rates going too high is not. The market is currently concerned that the Fed may end up tightening too far, which could cause a recession over the long-term. As a result, while short-term rates are rising, long-term rates are declining as the market lowers its interest rate expectations for the future. Consequently, the yield curve has flattened, which usually signals weaker economic conditions ahead. Amid fears of a yield curve inversion, there is debate over whether this remains a reliable recession indicator. This article assesses the implications of an inverting yield curve for the financial sector and the broader economy. \\n\\nSource: Yahoo Finance Prospectus Review: According to the Fund’s prospectus, the VFH ETF seeks to track the performance of the ‘Spliced US IMI Financials 25/50’ index using an indexing investment strategy. The fund is not concentrated in only large-cap stocks, but also holds exposure to mid-cap and small-cap stocks from the financial sector. The ETF has an annual net expense ratio of 0.10%, which is notably lower than the 0.38% average of all ETFs that offer exposure to the financial sector. The top holdings of the ETF include: \\n\\n\\n Risk Note: Note that while the fund management aims to track the underlying index as closely as possible, tracking errors could occur. For instance, if the proportionate weighting of a particular stock changes in the underlying index, the fund will have to buy/sell stocks accordingly, which could incur time delays and additional transaction expenses. The chart below indicates the tracking differences between the ETF price and the underlying index: \\n\\nSource: Vanguard Among ETFs that offer exposure to the financial sector, this ETF has one of the highest Assets Under Management (AUM), currently standing at around $6.09 million, according to data from ETFdb.com. I consider AUM as a good indicator for how successful the fund has been in implementing its strategy to deliver on its objectives for investors. The higher its AUM, the more investors have allocated their capital towards the fund due to effective management. Moreover, it also has one of the highest average daily trading volumes, currently at 1.04 million. Hence this means that the ETF has a relatively healthy level of liquidity. This is a good indicator for how easily investors can buy and sell shares in the ETF. Therefore, the higher the trading volume, the lower the liquidity risks. Flattening yield curve Banks borrow from the short-end of the yield curve and make loans at the longer end. The spread between the short-term and long-term rates is how they predominantly generate their earnings. However, the flattening yield curve this year has dampened investor sentiment towards the sector amid anticipation that banks’ earnings will suffer in the future. Moreover, amid fears of the yield curve inverting (10yr yield falling below the 2yr yield), investors are concerned that this will signal an upcoming recession. Since 1955, all nine recessions were preceded by an inverted yield curve. The reasoning behind this is that if the long-term rates fall below the short-term rate, banks have little to no incentive to lend out money, as those loans would be unprofitable for banks. Hence if banks reduce lending activity, this would tighten credit conditions and make it more difficult for businesses to raise debt capital. This in turn leads to lower capital expenditure and employment, which will be followed by lower consumer spending, whereby we would enter a weakening economic cycle which would result in a recession at some point after the yield curve has inverted. Therefore, once the yield curve inverts it is certainly not a good idea to hold onto the VFH ETF, as the financial sector will be one of the first sectors to reflect signs of weakening when a recession is on the horizon.\\n Contrary View However, there are market participants with a contrary view towards the implications of a yield curve inversion. They argue that while the yield curve inversion may have correctly forecasted previous recessions, this indicator is no longer valid following the financial crisis, as the ultra-loose monetary policy conditions adopted by the Fed, including Quantitative Easing (QE), have changed the dynamics of the credit markets. Moreover, QE has artificially suppressed long-term yields lower, which allows the yield curve to flatten and invert more easily. Nevertheless, I do not agree with this notion, because the Fed’s ultra-loose monetary policy actions following the crisis have lowered yields across the spectrum, and simply shifted the entire yield curve lower in comparison to historical levels. The banks’ business model has not changed dramatically. These financial institutions still borrow at short-term rates, and lend out at long-term rates. Hence the inversion of the yield curve still negatively affects bank profitability, regardless of the level at which the inversion occurs. Furthermore, while the Fed’s QE actions aimed to lower yields, the central bank is actually currently in the process of unwinding its balance sheet that it had built up during the recovery. Given that the weighted average maturity of the Fed’s Treasury holdings is 8 years, the Fed’s unwinding process should lead to this section of the yield curve to rise. The Fed began shrinking its balance sheet in October 2017, and since then the benchmark 10yr yield has surged from around 2% to over 3.20% in November 2018 (note that changes in the fed funds rate also influences the 10yr yield). However since November, the 10yr has actually declined back down to 2.75%, even amid the Fed persistently moving ahead with unwinding the balance sheet. This drop amid Fed tightening reflects the fact that significantly weaker economic conditions are expected over the long-term. Therefore, an inversion of the yield curve where the 10yr yield falls below the 2yr yield should still be considered a reliable indicator of a recession, or at the very least, gloomy economic conditions ahead. In either case, banks’ earnings will be hurt; hence investor sentiment towards the VFH ETF could remain weak.\\n Bottom Line The Fed may indeed end up hiking rates too far, to the point where the yield curve inverts. This will certainly hurt banks’ ability to generate earnings and profits, and could discourage them from making loans altogether if it is no longer profitable for them to borrow money at the short end of the yield curve and lend money at the longer end. I believe credit conditions will undoubtedly tighten next year, which will be reflected by a weaker financial sector and economy. Therefore, even though the VFH ETF has declined by about 17% this year, I do not recommend buying into the ETF until the shape of the yield curve turns more favorable for the financial sector.\\nDisclosure: I/we have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

Most of the market's classic dividend stocks have fallen by the wayside, and share prices for AT&T (T) have dropped by 29.26% in the last year. Rising debt levels have led many analysts to question the viability of AT&T’s supreme dividend yield. These criticisms are not entirely unreasonable, given that the company’s debt levels continue to hover near the $180 billion mark. But with an annualized dividend of $2.04 per share, AT&T’s payout ratio of 58% suggests a good measure of safety for long-term investors that are still holding the stock. AT&T generates strong levels of free cash flow, and the stock has become excessively cheap relative to its competition (based on forward-earnings valuations). As a result, investors focused on income generation should continue to look for opportunities to buy the stock in the weeks ahead. \\n\\n (Source: YCharts) Recent declines in AT&T’s share prices have certainly put the stock in precarious territory. But those declines have made the company’s valuations highly attractive for long-term investors. On a forward price-to-earnings basis, AT&T is currently trading at a 32.49% discount relative to key industry competitor Verizon Communications (VZ). These diverging trends in relative valuation began in April, and they have reached extremes now that we are coming to a close in 2018. In this case, a simple reversion to the mean would be greately beneficial for those holding T (when compared to those holding long positios in VZ).\\n \\n\\n (Source: Bloomberg) Of course, AT&T cannot claim to reign supreme in all relevant areas. After the company’s acquisitions of Time Warner and DIRECTV and Time Warner, debt levels have expanded in ways that can only be described as problematic. Roughly $50 million of AT&T’s current debt load will become due in the next five years, so this is a story which will not be going away any time soon. We must remember that these debt payments will become due as interest rate levels are rising, so there are strong elements of medium-term uncertainty which are tied to these issues. At the same time, we should note that Verizon’s debt levels come to roughly $112 billion. So it is not as if AT&T is unique in the obstacles which will be visible during these periods. \\n\\n (Source: Bloomberg) Investors focused on income generation will need to watch AT&T’s free cash flow figures, as this is a critical component in determining the company’s ability to maintain its high dividend payouts. On the basis of free cash flow, AT&T is currently trading at a discount of 38.83% when compared to Verizon. AT&T’s free cash flow figures are substantially above the figures generated by Verizon, and this will allow AT&T to maintain a solid margin of safety in its dividend offerings. As a point of comparison, Verizon’s dividend yield currently stands at 4.48%. This is well above the 1.30% average dividend yield seen throughout the technology sector but still far below the 7.42% dividend yield captured by those holding positions in T.\\n \\n\\n (Source: Author) All of that said, the chart outlook for AT&T looks very dismal after falling through triple-bottom support levels near $31.80 per share. The bearish momentum has been significant, and this has made it difficult for new investors attempting to identify a suitable point of entry. These sharp declines have been accompanied by rising trading volumes, so these events should not be dismissed as merely temporary in nature. Long-term support for the stock does not emerge again until we reach the lower $20s, and the strength of the bearish momentum suggests that investors will probably find continued opportunities over the next few weeks to buy the stock at lower levels. \\n\\n (Source: Zacks) Ultimately, there is still a sizable possibility that this activity will continue until the next earnings catalyst enters the market. AT&T is scheduled to report earnings on 01/30/2019, with the analyst consensus indicating a quarterly EPS performance of $0.85. If realized, this would mark an EPS gain of 8.97% relative to the same period last year. Over the last four quarters, AT&T has beaten market expectations on only two occasions (with an average upside surprise of 5.38% for the entire period). This places the current earnings estimates outside of the company’s annual averages, and this could make it more difficult for AT&T to deliver an upside surprise in earnings at the end of January. As a result, the stock should be viewed as a hold (rather than a buy) at current levels, as investors looking for a chance to develop exposure to this heavy dividend-payer may see better price level opportunities in the weeks ahead.\\n Thank you for reading. Now, it's time to make your voice heard. Reader interaction is the most important part of the investment learning process! Comments are highly encouraged. We look forward to reading your viewpoints on AT&T.\\nDisclosure: I am/we are long T. I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions.

Its WeChat platform has over 1 billion users and has 34% of China\\'s mobile data traffic. I detailed this in a previous article. The company\\'s main revenue streams emanate from this platform. Gaming is the largest, representing about a third of revenue. Music, online advertising, Cloud connections, payments through Tenpay and increasingly fintech all feed off the Internet platform. As I detailed here, the music division has 800 million users based around the company\\'s Internet platforms. Tencent has a new focus on business services on the Cloud. The company\\'s growing investments in the auto sector show a new strategic direction for Tencent. This is specifically in regard to EVs and what is termed the Internet of Vehicles. It is based around developments the company is making in AI. As with its other major revenue drivers, this will be based around its WeChat platform. Tencent Strategy The company has been quietly building up its presence in the auto sector. Its investments have been both in major auto manufacturers and in related auto service companies. Tencent can have a strong strategic role to play as EVs replace ICE vehicles. This ties in with the company\\'s revised strategic plan earlier this year. At that time it declared it would focus more on business services on the Internet as opposed to consumer services. In this regard, it is coming up head-on with its rival Alibaba (NASDAQ:BABA), which has a lead in the area. The magnitude of the Internet in China and how it dwarfs the USA is illustrated below: \\n\\n\\n (Source: South China Morning Post) As I\\'ve written previously, Tencent is a complex company with many irons in the fire. Some think its investments have had somewhat of a scattergun approach. The new focus on business to business seems sensible though, given the government\\'s restrictions this year on gaming. Tencent is the world\\'s largest gaming company but may have become over-reliant on that sector for revenue. The change in the company\\'s strategic plan ties in with encouragement from the government. Beijing has named Tencent as one of four companies to spearhead technology in the country, especially as it relates to AI. Self-driving cars and smart cities are part of the plan. Facial recognition is playing a large role in this. Tencent has its Computer Vision Research Centre focusing on facial recognition. China is behind the USA in AI development. It is catching up, though. In particular, this relates to specific solutions within China. The government is also building up the country\\'s semiconductor industry specifically as it relates to chips for self-driving cars. In September, Tencent launched its open platform for AI. This is accessed thorough subsidiary Tencent Cloud. The company\\'s cloud revenues are reported to have doubled in the last quarter. They are still small compared to Alibaba, in particular. Though, they are expected to see rapid growth in coming quarters. The latest Q3 2018 results from Tencent indicate the company will continue to have plenty of resources to continue its investment strategy. In that period, revenues rose 24% to US$11.7 billion and profit increased 30% to US$3.4 billion. This was despite the slowdown in gaming in China. The debt situation is very manageable: Quick Ratio = 1.17 Current ratio = 1.18 Total debt-to-equity = 0.52 The Value to Tencent The potential value of Tencent\\'s auto investments is difficult to gauge at present. However, a look at Google\\'s Waymo subsidiary gives some indication of the possible value added for Tencent. Morgan Stanley recently came out with a valuation for Waymo of US$175 billion. This is based on the value of its autonomous robotaxi business and logistics delivery business. There is additionally a small element for licensing value to other companies.\\n The Morgan Stanley valuation is higher than that of other analysts. It does, however, show the potentially huge business opportunities that companies like Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Tencent are pursuing. Specifically in China, the market for autonomous vehicles will increase much more rapidly than elsewhere in the world. Tencent has developed its own autonomous concept car and operating system. The company is looking at the value of monetising the journey customers take through its WeChat platform. A report earlier this year by McKinsey emphasised the trend. It forecast autonomous vehicles in China would comprise 13% of all sales by 2030, and 66% by 2040. That would equate to 8 million autonomous cars by 2030 and 13 million by 2040. The sales values would amount to US$230 billion and US$360 billion respectively. The value of chips used in such autonomous vehicles in China is expected to reach US$5 billion by 2021. The long-term revenue potential for Tencent is obvious. It explains the company\\'s determined quest to invest in as many parts of the new world of EVs as possible. EVs in China China is the world\\'s largest auto market. In 2017, there were 24.72 million passenger and commercial vehicle sales in the country. There are 210 million private cars on the road. The trend of EVs replacing ICE vehicles is gaining pace in China. The official target from the government is that all vehicles on Chinese roads should be electrified by 2050. That day may seem a long way ahead. However, the pace of change to get there would need to be rapid with huge commercial revenues to be fought over annually. The Chinese government classifies NEVs (new electric vehicles) as comprising three types. There are PHEVs (plug-in hybrids), BEVs (pure battery electronic) and a smaller category of fuel cell vehicles. Incentives vary across the types. In the first eleven months of the year, PHEVs rose to 3.3% market share. This compares to 2.1% market share in 2017. Total EV sales this year are expected to exceed 1 million vehicles. This would represent about a 100% annual increase. The government has a target for the sale of 2 million EVs in 2020. By 2025, it wants annual EV sales to total 7 million. That would represent about 20% of total auto sales. Already, the China EV market is larger than the USA and Europe combined, and growing more rapidly.\\n The Economist Intelligence Unit (subscription required) had forecast EV sales worldwide would total 1.5 million in 2018. Over 60% of these sales will be in China. They predict sales of 2.2 million in 2019. That would be out of a total of new car sales worldwide of about 69 million. The Ministry of Industry and Information Technology has stated that the market for \"smart network vehicles\" alone will be worth 100 billion yuan (US$15.9 billion) as early as 2020. The drive from the authorities is not limited just to autos. E-buses are a huge growth market, led by Yutong and by BYD Auto (OTCPK:BYDDF). E-trucks are also growing rapidly. The pace of the change from ICE to EVs can be argued. What cannot be disputed is that it is happening. This brings up the question of how EVs will change the way we travel. Car usage will trump car ownership. Freight delivery by autonomous vehicles will be a huge market. This is where Tencent stands to be in a strategically commanding position. Tencent has been leading research in China into AI for the auto sector. The likely trend of calling up autonomous cars on one\\'s mobile would fit perfectly into the company\\'s WeChat platform. It would be an obvious extension of the widespread hailing of taxis on the WeChat platform. Payment by Tenpay would be seamless. This drive from Tencent is not just China-based. The WeChat platform is expanding elsewhere in Asia as well. The move towards EVs in the rest of Asia is building up steam. For instance, Singapore has a trial programme for users to call up buses on their mobile phones. Already as things stand, these could, in theory, be called up in Singapore on the WeChat platform and paid for by Tenpay. Alternatively, one could call up a taxi on Indonesian taxi firm Go-Jek, in which Tencent has a substantial investment. There are a lot of strands pulling together throughout Asia. There is a very strong network of companies involved in the EV industry in China with whom Tencent now has investments or co-operation deals. I focus on some of these below.\\n Tencent and Tesla TenCent has a 5% stake in Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) bought at a cost of US$1.8 billion. I detailed the possible ramifications of this in an article in 2017. Elon Musk then referred to Tencent as an \"investor and adviser\". Tesla\\'s China subsidiary has registered capital of 4.67 billion yuan (US$681 million). The factory in China is costing about US$2 billion to construct, according to Elon Musk. Some analysts have predicted it will cost US$5 billion in the long run. In the first instance, it is slated to produce 500,0000 vehicles per annum. Later investments, though, will include substantial battery manufacturing. It is not known how exactly Tesla is financing this or whether Tencent will make a further investment in the company. Tesla\\'s finance requirements are currently closely tied up to Model 3 production. It would not be surprising to see a further investment from Tencent as the Shanghai factory comes up. Autonomous vehicles will be a growing investment opportunity for Tesla. There is a potentially great fit with Tencent. Another opportunity for the two companies lies in online auto sales. Tesla famously has eschewed the dealer network model common to the auto industry. Tencent has investments in online auto sales. Tencent and Didi Chuxing Tencent has a stake in Didi Chuxing (DIDI), the company that took over the business of Uber (UBER) in China. The 2014 investment is thought to have been about US$100 million. Apple (AAPL) also has a substantial stake. In many ways, Apple seems to be pursuing a similar path towards autonomous vehicles as Tencent. It seems to be less far down the road compared to Tencent though. Those on the WeChat platform can currently access Didi\\'s services. Didi is looking to set up EV car sharing services with 12 leading auto manufacturers in China. Tencent\\'s tie-up with Didi Chuxing is expanding around Asia. One can view it as part of the struggle with Alibaba, which itself is teamed up with Uber. Tencent and NIO NIO (NYSE:NIO) had a high-profile IPO in the USA in September. Tencent\\'s stake represented 15.2% of the company and 21.5% of the voting rights. NIO\\'s chairman, William Li, has 17.2% of the voting rights. So, Tencent and Lio together have a strong hold on the company.\\n Other key partners of NIO comprise Mobileye (INTC), Baidu (NASDAQ:BIDU) and China\\'s largest battery manufacturer, CATL. This looks like a strong grouping to try to grab pole position in China\\'s high-end EV market. NIO\\'s ES8 sports utility vehicle began deliveries in June. Its ES6 SUV should be debuting in the first half of 2019. Tencent\\'s stake gives it further access to NIO\\'s upcoming stream of EVs and its special emphasis on autonomous driving. NIO is very much looking at the upmarket part of EV demand. It could be seen as a direct competitor to Tesla in the Chinese market. It will probably need a large re-financing package in 2019. It will be interesting to see what role Tencent plays in that. Will Tencent be a major backer of both NIO and Tesla? That is a big question which may be answered quite soon. Tencent and Here HERE is a company concentrating on mapping data and location services. It grew out of the Nokia Maps business. With Tencent, it will be focusing on maps outside China. These can be channelled through the company\\'s WeChat and QQ platforms. This illustrates the international ambitions of Tencent as with its strategic investment in Indonesia\\'s ride-hailing company Go-Jek. Apart from Tencent, other investors in HERE include BMW (OTCPK:BMWYY), Audi (OTCPK:AUDVF) and Daimler (OTCPK:DDAIF). Tencent and FAW Group In April this year, Tencent signed an agreement with the FAW Group. It is the old, state-controlled manufacturer of the \"Red Flag\" brand in China. The agreement was said to be to develop autonomous driving with a particular emphasis on Internet of Vehicles security solutions. They will develop auto-driving solutions together and work on actual auto models for mass production. In October, the FAW Group received a startling US$145 billion credit line from the central government. This was said to be to \"develop auto-driving solutions\". The announcement of the April agreement was made by FAW Group on its Tencent site. Tencent and Changan Auto Also in April this year, Tencent signed an agreement with state-owned Chongqing Changan Auto Co. Tencent will have a 51% stake in the joint venture company, which will be developing an open platform to provide solutions for smart and connected autos. This seems to be a similar plan to the Apollo Project instituted by Baidu. That company already has an agreement with Changan. The agreement between Changan and Tencent has particular emphasis on developing an Internet of Vehicles platform. This will include data analysis of facial recognition and driver drowsiness detection.\\n Tencent and Guangzhou Automobile In 2017, Tencent made its first major move into the EV market when it teamed up with GAC. At the time, the stated aim was to develop smart cars which would be connected on the Internet and aided by AI. The two companies are pushing the concept of \"mobility as a service\", under the acronym \"MaaS\". This uses Tencent\\'s operating system. Tencent has developed the \"iSpace\" concept car using its \"AI in Car\" operating system. This is illustrated below: \\n\\n (Source: Autocar UK) The AI in Car system can recognise users when they enter the vehicle and customise their journey experience. This then opens up the possibilities of further monetising the driving experience. E-commerce for autos and speech solutions were also said to be areas of collaboration, as is insurance. Tencent\\'s main contribution in this regard will be by using its Cloud services and related technical support. Tencent and Bitauto Bitauto (BITA) is a company primarily involved in financing of the auto industry, in which Tencent has an investment. It is looking to be the largest online car finance platform. In another example of the interweaving between players in this industry in China, its chairman, William Li, is also chairman of NIO. Tencent and Renrenche Renrenche is a company selling used cars on peer-to-peer platforms. Tencent and Didi Chuxing are its top two institutional shareholders. Didi works very closely with Renrenche and plans to buy large numbers of used cars on the platform. Tencent and Future Mobility Corp. Future Mobility is specifically targeting the manufacture of luxury EVs. Its target was to have autonomous EVs on the road by 2020. That seems overambitious. In fact, all has been somewhat quiet about the progress this company is making. It is not certain how far the cooperation with Tencent has developed. It may well be that Tencent will focus more on NIO for the upmarket sector of the market.\\n Tencent and Harmony Futeng Harmony also has a stake in Future Mobility Corp. Harmony itself wants to launch smart EVs on Tencent\\'s Internet platforms. In 2017, it invested US$195 million in a 300,000 capacity plant. As with Future Mobility, there has been a lack of firm news on development plans recently. Tencent and Lyft Tencent has a co-operation agreement with California-based Lyft (NASDAQ:LYFT). Lyft is mainly involved in ride-sharing developments. It has a lot of trials on the road in the USA. Tencent has itself set up its own autonomous driving research team in California. The company has stated that this is focusing on various autonomous areas. These include perception and sensor fusion, motion planning and control, behaviour prediction, and machine learning. California is, of course, the home base of Google. Its Waymo technology is generally considered to be the most advanced on the market. Tencent and Tuhu China-based car maintenance startup Tuhu recently raised US$450 million in a fund raising exercise. The company is involved in after-sales service and supply, including ordering online through a mobile app. That may be where Tencent\\'s strengths can contribute. Conclusion Gaming and fintech should be strong drivers for revenue growth for Tencent in 2019. These are at the centre of much of the company\\'s investments, as I detailed here. In Q3, the sector defined as \"mobile payments and cloud services\" grew 69%. Much of the future growth is likely to come from this. Looking long term, the EV market based around the strengths of the company\\'s Internet presence could be a huge revenue earner. The Internet of Vehicles will be an important focus. WeChat will be the main platform, and the company\\'s AI developments the main driver. Tencent and its partners are looking to monetise the journey itself. It is a high-stakes game in which Tencent appears to have the will and the finance to last the course. The promise of this looks like a good bet for those who understand the transformation of the Chinese auto industry from ICE vehicles to EVs.\\n\\nDisclosure: I am/we are long TCEHY AAPL TSLA BYDDF.

The company’s clients are focusing more on sourcing chemistry products directly from manufacturers and providers of these products. This trend has thrown an operational and structural challenge to Flotek. In response, the company looks to diversify into the non-thermal manufacturing, including the nutraceutical, pharmaceutical and agriculture sectors. Increased share of value-added product sales, including CnF, should improve the company’s margin. I expect Flotek’s revenue growth to slow down in the near term. However, the stock should see a steady recovery in the medium to long term. In 2018 so far, FTK stock price has dipped by 75%, while the VanEck Vectors Oil Services ETF (OIH) declined by 46%. OIH represents the oilfield equipment & services (or OFS) industry. \\n\\n What are Flotek’s current drivers? From Q3 2017 to Q3 2018, Flotek Industries’ Energy Chemistry Technologies (or ECT) segment revenues decreased by 12%. The ECT segment, which provides specialty chemistries used in well drilling, cementing, completion and stimulation activities, saw a higher share of low-margin products and a reduction in orders from certain key customers. The primary reason for the headwind turned out to be a shift in purchasing behaviors by Flotek’s E&P customers. Upstream companies are focusing more on sourcing consumables, including chemistry, directly from manufacturers. This has become Flotek’s key operational challenge.\\n In Flotek’s Consumer and Industrial Technologies (or CICT) segment, revenues decreased by 6% year over year. Despite that, the segment’s EBITDA margin improved from 3.3% to 5.0% due to reduced direct costs and a better product mix. Through the CICT segment, the company designs, develops and manufactures products for the flavor and fragrance industry and the specialty chemical industry. What’s working for Flotek? On a quarter-over-quarter basis, the ECT segment revenues improved by 36% in Q3 2018. There has been increasing demand for Flotek’s Complex nano-Fluid, known as CnF, driven by unconventional drilling activity in the Middle East by the nationalized oil companies. During Q3, the Middle East surpassed Canada to become Flotek’s largest international geographic market. In the U.S., the ECT sales are primarily built through the full-fluids Prescriptive Chemistry Management (or PCM) platform. This is evidenced by the fact that 75% of the company’s clients use value-added chemistry as part of their fluid systems delivered through PCM after Q3, compared to only 50% by the end of FY2017. In the CICT business, Flotek is expanding into new citrus opportunities by investing in the extraction capabilities. This strategy is in line with its target to seek higher-margin sales opportunities in the flavor and fragrance business. Flotek’s cost reduction target \\n\\n In Q3 2018, Flotek’s quarterly cash SG&A decreased by 5% over Q2. Compared to Q4 2016, this was a 36% reduction. The company aims for further cost-cutting in the areas of salaries and benefits, travel and entertainment and variable incentives. As a result, management targets to bring cash SG&A levels down to 15% of revenues into 2019.\\n What are the industry challenges for specialty chemicals? In the past three years, the upstream operators have resorted to advanced fracking techniques and increased lateral length in their well completions designs to benefit from crude oil price dynamics. The other key challenge for the operators is to maintain capital efficiency in their infill development program in the child and parent wells. Increased level of capital is being used to address the down spacing concerns and unit production underperformance in the parent-child type of production. Flotek’s fluid design treatments have applications starting from the initial frac through the full lifecycle of the well. The company’s advanced chemistry products are targeted to mitigate the adverse effects of frac hits and underperforming wells. Is Flotek adding value to customers? \\n\\n Flotek’s products help reduce overall chemistry spend per well, optimize horsepower efficiency and reduce fluid reservoir incompatibility. According to company management's estimates, this saves its clients $1.9 million per month, which translates to more than $20 million in cost benefit per year. On top of that, the use of Flotek’s fluid leads to lower horsepower requirement, which leads to less overall wear and tear on their fluid ends. The company conducted a study in the Eagle Ford in 100 wells over two years. The study found that wells with Flotek-prescribed chemistry outperformed the proppant normalized production rates of non-treated wells. Wells using PCM technologies produced incremental 33,000 barrels of oil equivalent over the first year. In the CICT segment, the company looks to expand into non-thermal manufacturing. For example, the nutraceutical, pharmaceutical and agriculture sectors can present growth opportunities for Flotek. The use of D-limonene in the CnF technology can help the company break through into unchartered territory. D-limonene is considered to have low toxicity compared to the limonene chemical found in citrus fruit. Flotek sources citrus oil, which is used as an additive by companies in the flavors and fragrances markets and also has uses in the upstream energy companies.\\n Management guidance \\n\\n In Q4, the negative drivers for Flotek would be the upstream budget exhaustion as the year comes to the close and weather-related energy production disruption. The primary concern for the company is the change in clients' preferred choice of vendors and fluctuations in large orders from its international geographies. On the positive side, Flotek’s domestic sales in the ECT segment in October improved after some of its clients made the transition to the direct-to-operator PCM market channel. Management expects the CICT segment revenue to increase by a mid-single digit, while its EBITDA is also likely to improve. These stem from the company's expansion in Asia and the development of flavor application technologies. Flotek has negative cash flows In the first three quarters of FY2018, the company’s cash from operations outflow was ~$24 million. In 9M 2018, its cash flow deteriorated compared to the prior year. The cash flow decline reflects higher inventory level related to greater purchases of citrus oils from South America for FY 2019 and underperformance of internal consumption in the ECT segment. Its capex was not significant in the first nine months of FY2018. Flotek’s cash and cash equivalents were $1.8 million. As of September 30, 2018, the company had $15.2 million available under the revolving credit facility. As of September 30, 2018, Flotek Industries classified $53 million borrowings under revolving credit facility as current debt “as a result of the required lockbox arrangement and the subjective acceleration clause.” Despite no immediate repayment requirement, with negative cash flow from operations and a slender cash balance, its balance sheet can be exposed to potential financial risks.\\n What does Flotek’s relative valuation say? \\n\\n Flotek Industries’ EV-to-adjusted EBITDA multiple is not meaningful as a result of negative adjusted EBITDA in the past twelve months. According to sell-side analysts’ estimates pulled from Thomson Reuters, the company’s forward EV/EBITDA multiple is positive, which indicates analysts’ estimates of a positive EBITDA in the next four quarters. From FY2012 to FY2017, Flotek’s average EV/EBITDA multiple was 48.4x. So, its forward multiple is at a discount to the past six-year average. Also, the average forward EV/EBITDA multiple compression of Flotek’s industry peers versus their current multiple suggests an improvement in EBITDA over the next four quarters. The company’s forward EV/EBITDA multiple is higher than its peers’ (National Oilwell Varco (NOV), CARBO Ceramics (CRR) and Halliburton Company (HAL)) average of 9.6x. Analysts’ rating on Flotek \\n\\n According to data provided by Seeking Alpha, one sell-side analyst rated FTK a “Buy” in December, while one recommended a “Hold.” The analysts’ consensus target price for the stock is $3.0, which at its current price yields ~154% returns. A high percentage of institutional holding \\n\\n\\n Approximately, 74% of Flotek’s shares outstanding are held by insiders. According to data taken from Thomson Reuters, BlackRock and Vanguard are the top two institutional holders. Wilks Brothers also owns 4.7% of the company. Stock price volatility FTK is currently trading at $1.18. The stock price can fluctuate widely in response to various economic and non-economic factors. The stock price volatility has increased significantly in the past three months. Its one-month volatility has increased from the ~79% level by the end of September to ~99% now. This makes investing in this stock risky. What’s the take on Flotek? Flotek is having a difficult time readjusting to consumer preference in the energy chemistry technology industry. Its clients are focusing more on sourcing chemistry products directly from manufacturers and providers of these products. This trend has created significant changes in the company’s customer base, product portfolio and sales efforts. In addition to energy, Flotek looks to expand into non-thermal manufacturing, including the nutraceutical, pharmaceutical and agriculture sectors. ECT’s true values will unlock when its acceptance increases as E&P operators seek to enhance their well economics through chemistry technology. Flotek’s cash flow from operations has been negative in the past three quarters, which does raise some concerns. The current energy price downturn and completions activity slowdown will also have an adverse effect on Flotek’s revenues and earnings in the near term. However, the company’s long-term drivers have not changed. Increased share of value-added product sales, including CnF, should improve its margin. As the industry headwinds recede, I expect Flotek to grow steadily in the medium to long term.\\nDisclosure: I/we have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

It is truly a great buy that can easily give investors more than a 100% return. Introduction GE is a huge conglomerate with over a century of history that operates in several major industries, including energy, transportation, healthcare, financial services and aviation. Warren Buffett Likely to Move to Buy GE Famed investor Warren Buffett is known for looking for undervalued investments that present a compelling long-term advantage, and he is interested in companies that are selling at an undervalued discount relative to its fundamentals. Also, he looks for companies with a wide moat and great management but that are mispriced due to some temporary events. With Buffett at the tail end of his career, there is no better opportunity currently than General Electric. He has invested in the company in the past, and it has a long-storied history as one of the most successful companies of the last 100 years. So, it’s a company that Buffett would invest in, to make a big splash at the end of his long, storied career. Segment Analysis   GE Power        2017 2016 2015    Revenue 36 36.8 28.9 billion   Profit Margin 7.8% 13.9% 16.6%    Backlog 98   billion   GE Power is the company’s largest division. It manufactures gas and steam turbines, engines, generators, and high-voltage equipment and provides power-generation services and digital solutions. GE Power’s revenue grew from 2015 to 2017 because of demand for power generation equipment, but its profit margin dropped during this period because of overcapacity driving down pricing/margins as well as lower demand for service upgrades. GE management is planning to keep GE Power even though it is spinning off several other divisions. The division's backlog showed modest growth of only 3%, which caused worry among management because of the softening growth in power demand. The growth expected from traditional power is now going to renewables.\\n   Renewable Energy       2017 2016 2015    Revenue 10.3 9 6.3 billion   Profit Margin 6.8% 6.7% 6.3%    Backlog 15   billion   GE Renewable Energy is a manufacturer of onshore and offshore wind turbines, wind turbine blades, and hydropower solutions. Its revenues and profit margin increased from 2015 to 2017 because of strong revenue and orders growth, new product introductions, and new digital capacity. GE Renewable also saw a 15% increase in backlog due to increases in overall renewable energy demand worldwide. Its backlog was boosted by it securing orders from the largest wind farm in Australia - the 453 MW Coopers Gap Wind Farm in North Queensland. GE needs to invest heavily in this segment to boost orders because this is the company’s future. GE Renewable Energy has the potential to become the largest division of GE in the next 10 years. This strongly supports the investment thesis and is also a good sign for Warren Buffett.   Oil and Gas        2017 2016 2015    Revenue 17.2 12.9 16.5 billion   Profit Margin 1.2% 10.9% 14.5%    Backlog 21   billion   GE Oil and Gas provides oilfield services, oilfield equipment, turbomachinery, process solutions, and digital solutions. The oil and gas segment comprises 62.5% of Baker Hughes GE (NYSE: BHGE) following the combination of GE Oil and Gas with Baker Hughes in July 2017. GE Oil and Gas’s revenues increased from 2015 to 2017 because of increased business in oilfield services and digital solutions for oil and gas with GE’s purchase of Baker Hughes, but the post-merger integration and clash of cultures resulted in a crash in profit margin, and GE is looking to sell off or spin off the Oil and Gas division, as it is no longer compatible with the company’s long-term goals. This is also a value-creation opportunity for investors that agrees with the investment thesis: in the event of a spinoff, shareholders who buy GE stock will get shares from the spinoff of BHGE. Backlog growth remained flat in 2017 primarily because of the soft price of crude oil.\\n   Aviation        2017 2016 2015    Revenue 27.4 26.3 24.7 billion   Profit Margin 24.1% 23.2% 22.3%    Backlog 170   billion   GE Aviation manufactures commercial and military engines, aviation systems, and additive manufacturing machines. GE should look at merging this division with a slimmed down United Technologies (UTX) without Carrier and Otis. This will be a great merger that will yield a world-class Western player to take on the competition in aviation to come from China. GE Aviation can easily be merged with Pratt & Whitney, a division of United Technologies, and huge cost synergies be realized by eliminating overlaps. GE Aviation’s revenues and profit margin increased from 2015 to 2017 because of growth in commercial and military services offsetting margin pressure from the ramp-up of the LEAP engines. The LEAP backlog also drove the 10% increase in the $170 billion backlog. GE can basically merge this division with United Technologies and keep United Technologies a publicly traded company, with GE and minority shareholders owning the company. This will create an aviation powerhouse that the world has never seen, with pieces including United Technologies’ legacy aerospace business, Goodrich (acquired in 2011 by United Technologies), Pratt & Whitney, and the newly acquired Rockwell Collins and GE Aviation. It will be an amazing portfolio.   Healthcare        2017 2016 2015    Revenue 19.1 18.3 17.6 billion   Profit Margin 17.8% 17.5% 16.5%    Backlog 18   billion   GE Healthcare provides healthcare diagnostic imaging and clinical systems, life sciences products, and services and digital solutions. Its revenue and profit margin increased from 2015 to 2017 because of the customer demand for integrated precision health solutions as well as increased analytics capability.   Capital        2017 2016 2015    Revenue 9.1 10.9 10.8 billion   Profit Margin -74.7% -11.9% -74.1%    GE Capital provides industrial-aligned financial structuring and product support for GE businesses, including in aviation, healthcare, power, and renewable energy. This is a very important division because it provides the financing that allows GE to conduct financing deals with its customers. GE Capital’s revenues and profit margin decreased from 2015 to 2017 because of charges related to increased reserves for its insurance operations. Also, GE Capital will require $15 billion in capital over the next 7 years. GE Capital is needed but has too many liabilities, and some pieces of it have already been spun off, like Synchrony Financial. The reality is that the portfolio needs to be reviewed again, and more liabilities need to be spun off from the division. It is losing far too much money, and no company or division can survive with billions of dollars in losses.\\n The transportation and lighting businesses, while part of GE’s 2017 annual report, are no longer part of the company’s portfolio because they have been sold off. Some of the sales and spinoffs and restructuring at GE Capital didn’t happen fast enough, and this led to GE's board of directors bringing on a new CEO, Larry Culp, in 2018. GE could have gone further and split the Chairman role from the CEO role and given the Chairman role to a higher-profile person potentially from outside the United States - like Carlos Slim Helu - that knows how to deal with governments around the world. Its long-term goal of focusing on Energy and Aviation requires expertise in dealing with governments. Financial Analysis    GE   Profitability Indicator Ratios 2017 2016 2015   Gross Profit Margin 24.70% 29.27% 29.55%   Operating Profit Margin 9.73% 14.42% 14.36%   Profit Margin Analysis (Net Profit Margin) -4.74% 7.68% 1.45%   Return on Assets -1.56% 2.21% 0.30%   Return on Equity -9.00% 12.52% 1.73%   GE’s gross margin decreased from 2015 to 2017 because of increases in the costs of goods sold and services. Its operating margin decreased from 2015 to 2017 because of increases in sales, general, and administrative expenses. Net profit margin decreased from 2015 to 2017 because of investment contracts, insurance losses, and losses in insurance annuity benefits. The loss of investment contracts swung GE from weak profitability in 2015 to outright loss in 2017. The company’s return on assets and equity dropped sharply from 2015 to 2017 because of its losses in 2017.    GE   Debt Ratios 2017 2016 2015   Debt Ratio 83.00% 79.24% 80.05%   Capitalization Ratio 63.24% 58.18% 60.01%   Interest Coverage Ratio -0.81 2.80 3.36   Financial Leverage Ratio 5.78 5.66 5.81   GE’s debt ratio remained flat from 2015 to 2017 because total borrowing kept growing. The long-term portion of the borrowing is tied to GE Corporation (the oldest senior notes are due in 2055) and the subsidiary, GE Capital. This may be an opportunity for GE to look at selling off GE Capital to reduce long-term liabilities. GE’s capitalization ratio remained above 50% from 2015 to 2017 because of its high proportion of funding from long-term debts rather than from shareholder equity. The company’s interest coverage ratio collapsed from 2015 to 2017 because of a sharp drop in profitability. Its financial leverage ratio remained high from 2015 to 2017 because of drops in shareholder equity due to a more than 10% drop in retained earnings over this period.\\n    GE   Investment Return 2017 2016 2015   Price/Book Value Ratio 1.85 3.65 2.95   Price/Earnings Ratio -20.54 29.16 170.74   Price/Sales Ratio 0.97 2.24 2.47   GE’s price-to-book value dropped, primarily because of the sharp drop in its stock price from $30.71 at the end of December 2015 to around $14 in May 2018. This sharp drop was obviously because of the weakened profitability over this time frame, which has made the company much cheaper, potentially moving it into value territory, where Warren Buffett has operated throughout his 60-year career. GE’s price-to-earnings ratio swung sharply from triple digits to a negative value from 2015 to 2017. The number primarily reflects its weakened profitability during this period. GE’s price-to-sales ratio also dropped from 2015 to 2017, which is another sign that the stock had become much cheaper during this period.  Conclusion Warren Buffett will be looking to buy into GE at its attractive price. He will likely buy the stock currently or to seek a deal for one of its subsidiaries. The company is currently looking to divest $20 billion in assets, which gives Buffett an opportunity to buy at attractive valuations. GE is looking to trim down its exposure to its traditional power businesses and to sell its transportation, lighting, and healthcare businesses. Additionally, it is looking to spin off the oil and gas business. Furthermore, GE can merge with United Technologies to create a world-class aerospace division. These businesses are complementary to businesses that Buffett already owns: the power business is directly complementary to Berkshire Hathaway’s (BRK.A, BRK.B) energy business, and the transportation business is directly complementary to Burlington Northern Santa Fe.

According to a Mastercard SpendingPulse study, total U.S. retail sales, excluding automobiles, rose 5.1% between November 1 and December 24 from a year earlier. Overall, consumers in the United States spent over $850 billion during the holiday season. Online sales also jumped 26.4% from a year earlier. Not bad for a retail sector that has been a shadow of its former self. In spite of the stock market plummet and the holiday government shutdown, consumers have been more than happy to spend on their loved ones this holiday season. Craig Johnson, president of Customer Growth Partners, put it best when he said, “Wall Street is running around like a chicken with its head cut off, while Mr. and Mrs. Main Street are happy with their jobs, enjoying their best wage increase in a decade.” According to Johnson, the latest drop in gas prices helped consumers take a little more out of their pockets. As consumers realize deeper pockets, they were in more of a giving than saving mood this past month. The retail industry can sleep easily this week, but they are in for an uncertain future. Next year presents a challenging market for retail as buying continues to shift online. This has been a market trend that has hurt department stores - especially former giants such as Sears (OTCPK:SHLDQ) and Toys\"R\"Us. Mastercard SpendingPulse tracked sales from November 1 to December 24 and found that sales fell 1.3%. Despite the strong economic trends for retail, in-store visits are not as plentiful as they once were. Retail is evolving to become digital, and increasingly, mobile. This is a trend that will not slow down, and retailers have no choice but to adapt or die. As a result, retailers are going to enter 2019 hesitant for what the future might bring. With rising interest rates and volatility in Washington, D.C., this is an industry that will be completely altered come 2020. Some retailers, such as TJ Maxx (TJX), had positive trading years, but the truth of the matter is that not all retailers will survive 2019. E-commerce has changed the game, and many of these retailers are gambles to invest in.\\n The nicest of them all And who could be responsible for these alterations to the retail sector? The answer, of course, is Amazon (AMZN). The giant said on Wednesday that the number of voice-activated orders placed via Alexa were three times greater during the 2018 holiday season than they were in the last year. Amazon couldn’t let retailers have all of the fun over the holidays and insisted on getting involved. Thanks in part to its same-day delivery service on Christmas Eve, Amazon shipped more than one billion products for free through its Amazon Prime subscription service. This caused the stock price to jump about 90 points in the first day of post-Christmas trading. This holiday jump could not have come at a better time for Amazon, as it has been struggling recently. Since the company briefly topped $1 trillion in market capitalization in September, the stock has been falling - down almost 30%. This has put the company in a position for its worst quarter since the 2008 recession, when it lost 30% of its value. In 2008, Amazon was a completely different company, as Amazon Web Services came in 2006 and the lucrative Kindle a year later. The company has grown a lot since then, so the 30% drop is reminiscent of a prehistoric Amazon, causing investors to worry. Worry not, investors, Amazon is not the only company that has been falling. The stock market in general has been tanking out of concerns of rising interest rates and political instability, both domestic and abroad. Tech companies have been leading the surge to the bottom, with Facebook (FB) undoubtedly leading the charge, but for other reasons. Apple (AAPL) fell 30% this quarter, Microsoft (MSFT) dipped 12%, and Facebook dropped 18%. Although Amazon is having trouble staying above 1,400 in the recent months, the company has a lot to look forward to in 2019. \\n\\n\\n AMZN stock price certainly felt the positive effects of the holiday season, jumping as high as $1,440 on December 26th. However, the price came back to earth on the days following Christmas, and the stock is trading at around $1,400. Amazon Web Services Amazon has long dominated the retail space, but the truth of the matter is that many retailers have Amazon figured out. A lot of companies can model themselves after Amazon in the low-margin digital retail space. E-commerce is Amazon’s claim to fame, and the company still accounts for 49% of all online retail sales. But with competitors figuring out the market, this space is no longer that profitable. In fact, the operating margin has decreased to about 2.3%. Trading profits for market cap is no longer a viable business strategy; luckily, Amazon has other things in the works. The majority of the company’s bottom line continues to come from Amazon Web Services (AWS), its cloud computing segment. This is a segment that generates 59% of Amazon’s operating profits (thanks to its operating margin) despite contributing 11% of total revenue. Per Danny Vena of The Motley Fool, revenue from AWS could triple over the coming four years, giving the segment a market value of $350 billion. In fact, Jefferies & Co. analyst Brent Thill sees major growth out of AWS in the coming future: “Jefferies & Company analyst Brent Thill ran some calculations after attending Amazon\\'s re:Invent cloud-computing conference late last month. Thill sees AWS generating sales of $26 billion this year and reaching revenue of $71 billion annually by 2022, giving AWS a market value of $350 billion. Earlier this year, Amazon\\'s market cap briefly topped $1 trillion, but it\\'s currently worth about $766 billion. Thill made the case back in April that AWS would triple over five years, topping $60 billion by 2022, so his latest call is even more enthusiastic.” These numbers are undoubtedly enthusiastic but not as ambitious as they may sound. AWS produced $18.2 billion in revenue for the first nine months of this year. While we wait for the earnings of the fourth quarter to be released, AWS would need to produce $7.8 billion in revenue (or YOY growth of 52%) to hit on Thill’s estimate. And if there is any company that can return on this projection, it would be Amazon.\\n Part of the enthusiasm that analysts are feeling towards AWS comes in the wake of Amazon’s large announcements about the cloud platform. Biotech company Amgen (AMGN) is in the process of converting almost every one of its business processes to AWS, while mortgage processing specialist Ellie Mae (ELLI) and Guardian Life (private) have chosen to use Amazon. Another big commitment to AWS is Korean Airlines, a top 10 airline worldwide. The deals that Amazon continues to strike with companies and its AWS service are impressive, plentiful, and likely to grow even more as AWS establishes itself in the cloud computing world. Competition in this space is with tech giants like Microsoft and Alphabet (GOOGL), so success won’t come so easy. Google Cloud and Microsoft Azure are worthy opponents, but currently, AWS is dominating the space. Gartner forecasts cloud computing to be a $300 billion business by 2021 as companies increasingly adopt cloud services to achieve business outcomes through digital speed and ability. These top players will battle it out for market share in 2020, but AWS is poised for success. The competitors have closed the gap in market cap, but most estimates put AWS at 33% of market share. \\n\\n As a driver of Amazon’s bottom line, AWS’s success indicates that the company is not as one-dimensional in the e-commerce sector as one might think. In spite of growing holiday success in the retail space the company dominates, AWS represents why Amazon is still a buy. In terms of valuation, it trades at a much higher price than any of the competitors in the retail and cloud-computing space. Amazon has a forward P/E of 50.32, while its largest competitors in retail, Walmart and Target, trade with forward P/Es of 18 and 10.97, respectively. Microsoft trades with a forward P/E of 18. Amazon is so expensive mostly due to its lofty EPS projections, which analysts predict will grow by 44% over the next five years. The company has always traded at a lucrative price, but aside from the stock market dip, it has always been worth it.\\n Bezos was the first to achieve dominance in the online retail space and is among the first to explore cloud computing. Analysts’ projections in market position, growth, and operating margin are all rising, and for that, Amazon may be expensive, but it is a Buy at its current price.\\nDisclosure: I/we have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

Bulls and bears alike are eager to see a bottom, either for the purpose of buying bargains or covering short positions. The debate on Wall Street is whether the next confirmed market low will be only a temporary bounce in an ongoing downward spiral or the start of a renewed upward trend for stocks. In today’s report, I’ll make the case that the odds favor the latter scenario, but with a proviso: in order for the bottom to last, we must see an end to the 4-month liquidation trend for interest rate-sensitive securities. Although the stock market hasn’t yet established a bottom, the major ingredients for one are certainly there. Most of the commonly followed price-based oscillators for the major averages like the Dow and S&P 500 Index (SPX) have hit “oversold” extremes. Trading volumes have also reached levels which suggest at least a degree of capitulation. And bad news abounds in the headlines - another classical accompaniment of a bottom. Several measures of investor sentiment also indicate that the majority of participants are heavily convinced the market can only go one way, namely down. That’s another classic sign that the market has likely discounted the negative news for now and that a bottom is most likely imminent. Take, for instance, the options market. Several widely watched measures of option trader sentiment have in recent days hit extreme levels normally associated with market bottoms. The Total Put/Call Ratio earlier this week spiked to its highest level of the last four years. As you can see in the following chart exhibit, the ratio briefly rose to a level which suggested a huge increase in bearish options trading positions. This normally happens just as a downside trend in the major indices is about to reverse.\\n \\n\\n (Source: Index Indicators) Then, there’s the latest sentiment readings from the American Association of Individual Investors (AAII). In this week’s poll released on December 27, the percentage of bearish investors rose to just over 50%. This is my minimum expectation for a market primed for a tradable low; the higher above 50% bearish, the better. But given how stubborn AAII members have been to turn the least bit bearish in recent months, this is a welcome step in the right direction. Wednesday’s trading session was an eye-opener for the bears. The Dow had its best-ever 1-day point gain, while the Nasdaq Composite and SPX had their best showing in almost a decade. Volatility has drastically increased in both directions lately, which is suggestive of preliminary bottoming activity. Also worth mentioning is that the upside/downside volume ratio on the NYSE for Wednesday was 24:1, by far the most positive total volume ratio of this year. Even the single biggest problem facing the stock market since September showed major signs of improvement in the latest session. I’m referring to the non-stop bleeding visible in the daily number of NYSE-listed stocks making new 52-week highs and lows. Since September, the number of new 52-week lows on the Big Board has exceeded 40 in a sign that the stock market’s internal health has been less than ideal. Moreover, the new 52-week lows have tended to be in the triple digits, and occasionally in the quadruple digits, in the last three months. Most of these new lows were rate-sensitive stocks and funds as investors worried (and continue to worry) about the potentially negative impact of higher interest rates on the U.S. economy. The following graph highlights the obscene number of new NYSE 52-week lows in recent months. While there were “only” 177 NYSE-listed stocks and funds making new lows for Thursday, that’s a big improvement over the past several days. If the number of new lows continues to contract for the next few days, we’ll have a strong indication that a bottom is being established.\\n \\n\\n (Source: StockCharts) Another important sign that the market has finally established at least an immediate-term (1-4 week) bottom will occur once the S&P 500 has cleared above its 15-day moving average. This is delineated by the blue line in the graph below. However, a simple 2-day close above the 5-day moving average (yellow line) often serves as a preliminary bottom signal. That is, a 2-day close above the 5-day MA usually means the market is trying to establish a bottom, and in most cases, a close above the 15-day MA follows shortly thereafter. Traders should consider this as a useful technical signal when trying to spot bottoms. As of Thursday, the SPX has closed twice above its 5-day moving average in succession. This increases the odds that a bottoming attempt is underway. \\n\\n (Source: BigCharts) However, a more important consideration for intermediate- to longer-term oriented traders is whether or not the next confirmed bottom in the major indices can be trusted. Often, after a major decline in the SPX, the first rally after a low has been made can be deceptive. Rally failures are common in bear markets, so it behooves us to discern the reliability of the market’s next rally. As you might have guessed, the most important criterion I use to determine the strength of a market bottom is the new 52-week highs and lows. But while the quantity of the new highs and lows is important, the quality of this metric is also key. A substantial number of NYSE stocks making new lows during the market decline have been various types of income-oriented equities, including muni-bond funds, real estate stocks, royalty trusts, etc. These interest rate-sensitive securities have figured prominently in the market’s October-December correction, and for good reason. One of Wall Street’s biggest fears is a too-high (relative to T-bond yields) Fed Funds interest rate. With the Fed threatening to raise rates even further next year, the market has serious doubts as to the tenacity of the bull market in stocks.\\n For that reason, it’s imperative that we see a significant shrinkage or outright disappearance of rate-sensitive securities on the Big Board in the coming weeks. Otherwise, any recovery that happens from here is likely to be of temporary duration, since the main problem afflicting the market since September hasn’t been addressed. Only when income-type equities aren’t consistently showing up on the 52-week new lows list will we know that the next bottom can be trusted. On a strategic note, corporate profit growth remains on a positive trajectory, and the probability is high that the large-cap major averages will trend higher in the coming six months. However, the current investment climate isn’t yet conducive for initiating new long positions in equities. The internal condition of the stock market remains weak based on the extremely elevated number of securities making new 52-week lows on the NYSE and the Nasdaq. A defensive posture is, therefore, still warranted for now, and investors should be mostly in cash.\\nDisclosure: I/we have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

SRG shares quickly popped into the 50's, which was a great exit point, but even as they have now fallen back into the low 30's, there appear to be problems on the horizon. \\n\\nSRG data by YCharts Press reports indicate that a Sears liquidation is becoming more and more likely, which would mean that Seritage would potentially be stuck with 26 million square feet of empty store space, to go along with about 9 million of existing non-Sears (OTCPK:SHLDQ) tenants (both through in-place and signed-but-not-yet-opened leases). The problem is that Seritage's redevelopment activity thus far has produced rents of roughly $21 per square foot, according to the company's Q3 2018 quarterly supplemental (page 14 shows $193 million of projected annual income on 9.126 million square feet across 79 announced projects). SRG bulls will quickly highlight that such rents are much higher than the sub-$5 per-square foot that Sears is paying. While certainly true, the problem for SRG equity investors is the cost of developing the properties and their public market value afterwards. According to the same supplemental document, SRG expects to spend $1.384 billion to develop those ~9.1 million square feet. Let's round the construction costs off to an even $150 per square foot.\\n The problem with such a sky-high construction cost is that the post-construction value of these projects is unlikely to be materially above $150 per square foot. Put another way, all of SRG's vacant space which requires redevelopment is worth essentially zero. How can this be possible? Well, let's take a look at a valuation model for SRG's real estate:   Post-Development Value per SF ---> $125 $150 $175 $200   Target Valuation (FFO Multiple) 12x 12x 12x 12x   Target Company FFO Margin (% of sales) 50% 50% 50% 50%   Implied Rent per SF $16.67 $20.83 $25.00 $29.17   Readers may agree or disagree with my assumptions (50% FFO profit margin and 12x FFO valuation multiple), but the basic exercise is still worth pondering (and I don't see either metric as being overly punitive). The core conclusion is that in order for SRG's vacant space to be worth more than zero, the implied rents from the redevelopment have to be above $21 per foot. This is because, under the above valuation scenario, $21 rents would be valued by the public market at $150 per foot, identical to SRG's estimated construction costs. As the table shows, if rents reached $29 per foot, one could justifiably value SRG's real estate at $50 per foot prior to redevelopment. As of September 30th, SRG has 9 million of non-Sears leases at average rents of about $15 per foot and 26 million of space either vacant of currently leased by Sears Holdings. If you value the 9 million square feet at the same valuation multiple as suggested above, and you further assume SRG will redevelop the remaining 26 million on similar terms as the 79 projects they have already announced, you come up with a total value for the 35 million square foot portfolio of about $4.9 billion. At first glance, that figure looks okay relative to SRG's current $2.86 billion enterprise value, as it implies upside for the common shares to about $70 per share, assuming constant debt levels. Of course, the problem is that it will cost SRG about $3.9 billion to redevelop those 26 million square feet, assuming future projects look much like the ones they have started or completed thus far.\\n So the question for SRG equity holders becomes, assuming Sears liquidates, how much do you pay today for their 35 million square feet of real estate? The answer probably isn't $1 billion ($4.9 billion less $3.9 billion of further redevelopment cost) because there will be retailers and landlords who choose to buy stores from SRG and do the redevelopment themselves, especially in malls where the Sears box is the only one the mall owner does not yet own). But those offers are unlikely to be astronomical due to too few bidders. Let's say SRG sells 30% of the vacant stores for $50 per foot, on average, and redevelops the remaining 70%. SRG would collect $390 million of cash and be left with a portfolio of 27 million square feet and ~$2.7 billion of remaining construction costs (only $2.3 billion of which would require additional funding). Assuming $21 average rents, the total portfolio would be worth ~$3.7 billion ($1 billion for the legacy properties and $2.7 billion for the future redevelopments). Subtract incremental future borrowing needs of $1.7 billion (SRG currently has $600 million of cash in the bank and would collect another ~$400 million from store sales) and SRG's implied equity value would be just $2 billion after Sears has been replaced completely as a tenant. With ~56 million outstanding shares, SRG's common stock would only be worth $36 per share, or less than 10% above the current price, in that scenario, despite it playing out many years into the future. In summary, unless SRG's future redevelopment efforts yield results far better than the $21 rents and $150 per foot construction costs that their first 79 projects are projected to generate, a Sears liquidation in early 2019 could erase much of the upside for SRG's equity investors.\\nDisclosure: I/we have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

Key Takeaways  The key theme in 2019 is prompted by the question: When and how will the cycle end? While the managers believe we live in a much less inflation-prone world, they also believe there is a small but unlikely possibility of a sudden acceleration in inflation, leading to aggressive rate hikes by central banks. The key opportunity is the fact that the economy is in a late-stage cycle. If true, as the cycle turns, there may be opportunities in quality government and investment grade bonds.     Transcript What are the key themes likely to shape markets in 2019? John Pattullo: I think the key themes for 2019 is really the answer to the following question: Is it the end of the cycle, and how is it going to end? 2018 has been classically late cycle, in our mind, of a very long cycle, and hence, really a test of \"Is growth going to fade? Was the Trump fiscal expansion a sugar rush, or was it something more structural?\" which we\\'re skeptical of. Is inflation going to come through? Which, again, we are pretty skeptical [of]. And then, what\\'s going to happen to global demand, and growth and inflation, respectively, and hence, which asset class do you want to position accordingly? Where do you see as the most important opportunities and risks within your asset class? Jenna Barnard: The key risks for bond investors is a sudden acceleration in inflation, either consumer price inflation or wage inflation, to which central banks react aggressively. In our mind, we think we live in a much less inflation-prone world. With the oil price coming off at the end of 2018, obviously that is helpful for headline inflation, but the risk really is central banks that are itching to normalize interest rates, take them back to a level which they consider more normal in order that they can cut them in the next recession. So far, the only central banks that have managed to do that are the US Federal Reserve and the Canadian central bank. For many reasons, other central banks in the developed world have struggled to raise interest rates. So, the risk to bond markets is inflation taking off and some central banks being given the opportunity to raise rates more aggressively.\\n In terms of the credit market, the risk is that it\\'s late cycle. There has been a huge deterioration in the quality of companies that have been raising debt, the amount of debt they\\'ve raised, the use of proceeds and, if John\\'s right or the market\\'s right in indicating that it is very late cycle, then obviously, credit is going to suffer in the next asset price correction. The opportunities are that it\\'s late cycle. That is the most difficult environment for a bond investor because credit spreads move wider - they tend to... credit spreads tend to lead the equity market peak - and bond yields and duration is very choppy and difficult to make money. So, in a late-cycle environment, you can\\'t make money, either, in credit, particularly, or in government bonds. If it\\'s late cycle and the cycle turns down, in the next phase, you can make money as a bond investor through quality government bonds and quality investment-grade bonds - and you can make quite a lot of money. How have your experiences in 2018 shifted your approach or outlook for 2019? Barnard: I think throughout 2018, we were working under the assumption that it was late cycle, and we saw that through multiple asset classes: the oil price melting up, lack of breadth in the equity market, flatness of the yield curves in the government bond market, credit spreads beginning to widen, real yields spiking higher... so, every asset class, to us, was kind of ticking the late-cycle check list. With the equity market sell-off in October, with the oil price crashing in October 2018, I think we got additional confirmation that it\\'s \"later\" late cycle. I don\\'t know if you want to add anything? Pattullo: Yeah, no, definitely. I think it is definitively late cycle. But I think that, yeah, you need a degree of patience and perspective of that fact. And we have to accept that. The clients have to accept that. And for a while, cash would outperform and short-duration bonds would outperform. And then the correlations - with equities potentially falling, bond yields will start falling as well. And I think as the peak of rates is realized by the markets, as Jen said, the opportunity there is to get long duration in quality bonds, and you can make capital again.\\n So, I guess it\\'s not just a calendar year that you have to be patient for. You may need to see it through the year end. You may get a rally into Christmas in equity markets, which may drag up bond yields. If that\\'s so, we\\'ll probably extend duration, because we think this sugar high is not going to last and growth and inflation have peaked, and that you just have to position yourselves and your clients with you accordingly and tell them what you\\'re doing. And then get the rewards of that. As in when they come, just sometimes you\\'ve got to be a little bit more patient than maybe you thought you had to be. But as long as you communicate that, I think that\\'s really where we are as a management team, aren\\'t we? ___________ Bond yield: The level of income on a security, typically expressed as a percentage rate. Note, lower bond yields mean higher bond prices, and vice versa. Credit market: A marketplace for investment in corporate bonds and associated derivatives. Credit spread: The difference in the yield of a corporate bond over that of an equivalent government bond. Duration: How far a fixed-income security or portfolio is sensitive to a change in interest rates, measured in terms of the weighted average of all the security/portfolio\\'s remaining cash flows (both coupons and principal). It is expressed as a number of years. The larger the figure, the more sensitive it is to a movement in interest rates. Inflation: The rate at which the prices of goods and services are rising in an economy. The CPI and RPI are two common measures. Late cycle: Asset performance is often driven largely by cyclical factors tied to the state of the economy. Economies and markets are cyclical, and the cycles can last from a few years to nearly a decade. Generally speaking, early cycle is when the economy transitions from recession to recovery; mid-cycle is when recovery picks up speed; while in the late cycle, excesses typically start to build, growth slows, wages start to rise and inflation begins to pick up. It is often in the late stage that investors become overconfident.\\n Fixed-income securities are subject to interest rate, inflation, credit and default risk. As interest rates rise, bond prices usually fall, and vice versa. High-yield bonds, or \"junk\" bonds, involve a greater risk of default and price volatility. Foreign securities, including sovereign debt, are subject to currency fluctuations, political and economic uncertainty, increased volatility and lower liquidity, all of which are magnified in emerging markets.

With that said, let\\'s dive into the recap of 2018 and the outlook of 2019 with some \"thin\" stock market predictions.  Stock Market in 2018 On January 2nd, 2018 - the first trading day of the new year - the Dow Jones Industrial Average was priced at 24,824. At the time of this writing, the Dow Jones was priced about the same. Overall, the market has mostly moved sideways in 2018. There have been plenty of ups and downs throughout the year, but these ups and downs have canceled out to create very little change in the market. In spite of the fact that the market has moved sideways throughout 2018, valuations remain very high. Right now, the Shiller P/E ratio - a ratio that reflects the average P/E of all the companies in the S&P 500 - is at 26.6. This is almost double the average Shiller PE ratio since the late 1800s, which is 15.68. It\\'s also nearing the all-time high of the Shiller P/E ratio, which took place when the Shiller P/E ratio hit 44.19 in December of 1999. For those trying to find good investment opportunities in the market in 2018 - opportunities to purchase a company at a price that is on sale compared to its value - these high valuations haven\\'t been good news. However, it looks as if they might be on the verge of coming to an end. What does that mean we can expect for 2019? All of the signs indicate that we\\'re in for a significant stock market correction across the market in 2019. Bull markets never go on forever without a correction, and this current bull market has been trudging along since March 2009. It\\'s certainly possible that it could continue well into 2019, if not 2020, but the market\\'s sideways movement in 2018, combined with high valuations across the board, make that very unlikely. Far more likely is the possibility that we will see corrections across the market of 20% or higher as the bull market reaches the peak of its run and begins to tumble down.\\n Some companies may see corrections even higher than 20%, depending on the industry that they are in and the specific company itself. While this is certainly concerning news for some investors, it\\'s also quite exciting if you know how to prepare for it. Stock Market Predictions for 2019 The answer is to get your shopping list of quality companies out and get your cash ready - a lot of great buying opportunities are about to come available. Corrections like the one we might see in 2019 don\\'t come around very often, and they are always excellent opportunities for investors who have cash to spend and time to wait on the market to climb back up again - a process which typically begins less than a year after a large correction and sometimes as soon as a couple months. If you approach 2019 with this mindset and strategy, it is sure to be an exciting time. For the first time in years, investors will have the opportunity to scoop up high-quality companies at low prices, setting themselves up for some considerable gains in the years to come. However, it\\'s also important for those who are already invested to keep in mind that 2019 is not the time to sell off the stocks that you own. Original Post\\n']}\n",

When they decline sharply, investors get frightened. If selling is extreme, it leads to fear and trepidation. What might signal a more favorable climate? Holding “support?” A big rebound rally? Favorable news? Mustn’t there be something? Beware of these high-profile traps. My own comments follow in italics.  The “sucker’s rally” trap. This term was applied by many to Wednesday’s historic market gains.  [If declines like those of the last few months are bearish, shouldn’t a rebound suggest a glimmer of hope? I am always suspicious of those who resort to calling names about anyone who disagrees with them]. The bogus and backward comparison trap. Today we see pundits, mostly those on my “reliably bearish” Twitter list, explaining that huge rallies like Wednesday’s were typical of bear markets. [Start with a couple of hundred variables. Do a screen for what current trading shares with a few bad times. Your post writes itself. The handful of examples provides little evidence of what might happen next. You cannot do reliable statistical evidence based upon a few cases]. The “I remember” trap. The pundit does not use a computer screen for this. It is enough to remember some dangerous past time in history and summon up a few similarities. [Those with a different viewpoint can do the same. I remember 2011 — debt ceiling debate, political dysfunction, worries about the US credit rating, and no sign of compromise in Congress. Consumer confidence collapsed, even though the crisis was averted. Markets declined about 20%. And then they swiftly rebounded. Finding an example or two is interesting, but not real evidence.] The wise market trap. The financial news industry depends upon finding some message in each and every market move — whether there is a logical reason or not. When expert guests are interviewed, they are challenged about what the market “is telling us.” [If you are a serious investor making your own decisions, you believe you have some “edge.” This means that markets are not completely efficient. You take advantage of the emotional reactions to establish or sell you sound positions. You realize that the market “forecasts” many events that never happen — especially recessions.] The laundry list trap. It is easy to recite a litany of problems. These currently include slowing global economic growth, Fed policy, political uncertainty, trade issues, Brexit, commodity prices, and regional military conflicts. [Most do not recognize that there is always such a list. As problems are addressed, even partially, new worries replace the old. Bull markets thrive on a long list of fully-recognized worries. It is the surprise that represents danger]. \\n Understanding these traps is essential for successful investing. Those trying to scare you witless [TM OldProf euphemism] are on a mission to sell gold, annuities, structured products, page views, TV ratings, or newsletters. You will do much, much better with a diversified portfolio suited to your individual needs, but it is easier said than done. The traps are everywhere.

The list contains nearly 900 stocks trading on U.S. exchanges with the distinction of having paid higher dividends for at least 5 consecutive years. An accompanying spreadsheet providing key data on the CCC stocks is maintained by Justin Law. With my monthly 10 Dividend Growth Stocks series, I rank a subset of CCC stocks and present the 10 top-ranked stocks for further research. In the October edition, I debuted a new ranking system. The ranking system assigns letter grades to stocks relative to their performance among sector peers. Having a sector-oriented ranking system avoids the problems associated with ranking dissimilar stocks. This month I decided to rank CCC stocks in one of the defensive sectors, Consumer Staples. Given the increase in market volatility since October, perhaps it is prudent to start considering defensive stocks. Defensive stocks tend to outperform the broader market during market downturns. The CCC List: Consumer Staples The latest CCC list (dated 11/30/18) contains 865 stocks. There are 130 Dividend Champions—stocks trading on U.S. exchanges with higher dividend payments for 25 or more consecutive years; 200 Dividend Contenders (10-24 year streak); and 535 Dividend Challengers (5-9 year streak). The CCC spreadsheet contains 47 Consumer Staples sector stocks. I ranked 40 of these stocks after excluding stocks with yields below 1%, stocks with market capitalization below $1 billion, and stocks trading over the counter.\\n \\n\\n Collectively, the stocks have a fair value upside of 0.7% and an average dividend yield of 3.3%. An equal-weighted portfolio would have returned -4.9% in the past year. Interestingly, the stocks have outperformed the S&P 500 by about 9% over the last five years. Overview of My Ranking System I ranked the 40 Consumer Staples sector stocks using data available in the CCC spreadsheet and additional sources like Morningstar, F.A.S.T. Graphs, finbox.io, and Simply Safe Dividends. My ranking system assigns letter grades to each stock relative to its performance among sector peers, in each of the following four categories:   Consistency and rate of past earnings growth   Dividend Safety and sustainability of payments Financial Health of the company and quality of the stock Growth of dividends and earnings (history and outlook)  I assigned A, B, C, D, and F grades to 8 stocks in each category. The letter grades are assigned based on scores assigned to different metrics in each category. Metrics are weighted relative to how important I consider them to be. For example, I have one metric in each category with a relative weight of 3, three metrics with weights of 2 each, and several additional metrics with weights of 1 each. The maximum score per category is 25, so the total score for each stock is out of 100. Stocks are ranked from the highest to the lowest based on total score. Note that I no longer mix valuation metrics into my ranking system. Instead, my ranking system will attempt to identify top-quality dividend growth stocks regardless of valuation. As before, I\\'ll provide fair value estimates of the top-ranked stocks to help readers identify potential candidates for further research.\\n Top 10 Consumer Staples Sector Stocks Here are the top 10 Consumer Staples Sector stocks according to my ranking system:    Top 10 Consumer Staples Sector Stocks (December 2018) \\n\\n  November\\'s Edition of 10 Dividend Growth Stocks  The stocks I own in my DivGro portfolio are highlighted. 1 • Hormel Foods (HRL) HRL is a multinational manufacturer and marketer of consumer-branded food and meat products.

WBA was founded in 1901 and is based in Deerfield, Illinois.\\n Please note that the top 10 ranked Consumer Staples sector stocks are candidates for further analysis, not recommendations. Below is a finbox.io analysis of the top 10 Consumer Staples sector stocks for December 2018: \\n\\n Only three stocks are trading below fair value (according to finbox.io) and, overall, the stocks have a fair value downside of about 8%. Note also the more modest dividend yield of 2.2%. On the other hand, these stocks have returned 7.6% in the past year and 84% over the last five years! The 5-year performance is more than double that of the S&P 500 over the same period. Grades and Key Metrics The table below presents key metrics from the CCC spreadsheet (unless noted otherwise), a fair value estimate, and letter grades for each stock. The letter grades are for Consistency (C), Safety (S), Health (H), and Growth (G) as described earlier. In the table, Years are the years of consecutive dividend increases and Payout Ratio is the earnings payout ratio, courtesy of Simply Safe Dividends. When available, I provide Standard & Poor\\'s Credit Rating and the compound dividend growth rate over a 5-year period (5-Yr DGR) from the CCC spreadsheet. I also provide the adjusted operating earnings growth rate for a 10-year period (10-Yr EGR) from F.A.S.T. Graphs and the Dividend Safety Score (out of 100) from Simply Safe Dividends. Finally, I present my own estimate of Fair Value. \\n\\n To estimate fair value, I calculate my own fair value estimates using proprietary implementations of the multi-stage Dividend Discount Model and the Gordon Growth Model. I also reference fair value estimates and target prices from other sources, including finbox.io, Morningstar, and F.A.S.T. Graphs. With up to nine estimates available, my final fair value estimate ignores the lowest and highest, then averages the median and mean of the remaining estimates.\\n Several stocks are trading below my fair value estimates and, of the stocks I don\\'t own, EL and TSN seem to be worth a look. Commentary In September I ranked 240 stocks using my previous ranking system and presented the 10 top-ranked dividend growth stocks by sector. Here are the top-ranked Consumer Staples sector stocks from that article: \\n\\n HRL tops both lists, while WBA, MO, WEC, and CHD \"survived\" my ranking system change. Two stocks I own, Procter & Gamble (PG) and Walmart (WMT), no longer are in the top 10. PG is ranked #24 and WMT is ranked #33. Both have very low Consistency and Growth scores. The only other Consumer Staples stock I own is Coca-Cola (KO), which is ranked #35. Given their lowish ranks, I\\'ll need to take a good look at PG, WMT, and KO. Are there higher-ranked but comparable stocks that could replace them? Some Good-Looking Charts Below, I\\'m including charts from F.A.S.T. Graphs for three of the top-ranked Consumer Staples sector stocks. In these charts, the black line represents the share price, and the blue line represents the calculated P/E multiple at which the market has tended to value the stock over time. The orange line is the primary valuation reference line. It is based on one of three valuation formulas depending on the earnings growth rate achieved over the time frame in question. (The Adjusted Earnings Growth Rate represents the slope of the orange line in the chart). \\n\\n\\n CHD\\'s chart is a model of consistency! Over the coverage period of about 10 years, CHD achieved an earnings growth rate of 10.8%. The stock\\'s annualized RoR (rate of return) is even higher at 18.6%. For comparison, the S&P 500 has an RoR of 11.7% over the same period. Dividends are shown as the light green area above the orange line, but also as the white line within the dark green shaded area and relative to the orange line. The white line graphically represents CHD\\'s payout ratio (also a model of consistency!). The chart confirms that CHD is trading at a premium to fair value, and it would be best to wait for the share price to pull back. Next, let\\'s look at EL: \\n\\n EL is not quite as consistent as CHD, but the stock\\'s earnings growth rate is significantly higher at 19.4%. EL\\'s annualized RoR over the period also is higher at 24.2%. EL\\'s share price is down about 19% from its 52-week high of $158.80. Although the F.A.S.T. Graphs analysis indicates that EL is trading a little above fair value, I think EL already is trading at a discount to fair value. I think EL is a good candidate for further research and possible investment. Finally, consider TSN: \\n\\n At 29.4%, TSN\\'s earnings growth rate is truly impressive! Over the 10-year period represented in the chart, TSN\\'s annualized RoR is 18.0%. The stock is trading at a discount to fair value, in my estimate by about 27%. Concluding Remarks In this article, I ranked 40 stocks in the Consumer Staples sector.\\n While I don\\'t consider valuation metrics in my new ranking system, I continue to provide fair value estimates of the ranked stocks. Five of the ten top-ranked stocks are trading below my fair value estimates. Of the stocks I don\\'t own, EL and TSN look most attractive. But MO and WBA are trading well below my fair value estimates, too. Thanks for reading! \\nDisclosure: I am/we are long HRL, MO, WBA, PG, WMT, KO. I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions. I am not receiving compensation for it (other than from Seeking Alpha).

December is setting the wrong kind of records, and Q4 has been a bumpy one in general. This is what happens in the stock market sometimes, but it\\'s been easy to forget over the decade-long bull market. We\\'re using the end of the year as a chance to lift our heads, survey the market, and see what might be coming ahead. To do so, we\\'re inviting our Marketplace authors to do a series of roundtables. 2018 was another steady growth year for the platform, and we have a lot of great voices on the Marketplace, so we wanted to share their perspective with you. Our Year End Marketplace Roundtable series will run through the first full market week in January. We\\'ll feature ten different roundtable discussions, with expert panels chiming in on Tech, Energy, Dividends, Other Income strategies, Gold, Value Investing, Small-Caps, Alternative Investing Strategies, Biotech, and the Macro Outlook. This roundtable looks at biotech, which has taken it on the chin like much of the market. We ask our panelists how they adjust their biotech investing in down markets, what they enjoy about the sector, and what ideas and themes are on their horizon:   Jonathan Faison, author of ROTY   Slingshot Insights, author of Become The Smart Money   Early Retiree, author of Stability & Opportunity   Avisol Capital Partners, author of The Total Pharma Tracker   Jérôme Verony, author of Second-Level Investing   BioSci Capital Partners, author of Integrated BioSci Investing   Wall Street Titan, author of Stem Cell News and Analysis   Clover Biotech Research, author of The Formula   Terry Chrisomalis, author of Biotech Analysis Central   ONeil Trader, author of Growth Stock Forum  \\n Seeking Alpha: 2018 was the most sustained down-period for biotech since 2015. How is this time similar or different to that time? Slingshot Insights: I think they are similar in that there has been a surge in VC investment and IPOs. The \"sector\" discussion has been around drug pricing. The reality is that science is advancing at the same pace or faster, M&A is still very likely given balance sheets (cash available, not debt needed). Biotech in particular can be revalued by macro trends, which creates buying opportunities rather than structural, long-term weakness. Early Retiree: In 2015, the generic pricing bubble exploded and, for some time, markets tried to gauge how much and what exactly would change from a regulatory standpoint. So far, lawmakers haven\\'t really changed that much, while market participants have adjusted to the new reality. In Stability & Opportunity, we have followed very closely the debate around Express Scripts (ESRX) and PBMs in general. All PBMs are now back under the roofs of insurers, which is likely helping them to preserve their share of pharma profits. So, from this point of view, business could go on as usual - but on the other hand, the self-correcting mechanisms of free markets have worked and pricing is under pressure without any intervention from lawmakers. This is the story of the 2018 decline: There are just too many biotechs targeting the very same large indications. Even if only a small part of the current global pipeline will effectively be launched, competition will inevitably pressure prices. In addition, the FDA is finally accelerating the approval of generics. The market is taking notice, and this is keeping down valuations. By focusing on clearly differentiated treatments with little potential competition, investors can take advantage of the broad-based price drop. Avisol Capital Partners: The 2015 biotech bloodbath was caused by specific events beginning with that infamous Hilary Clinton speech. So the fall was sudden and spectacular. 2018 doesn\\'t have such climactic events leading to the down period. So the 2018 fall is more extended, somewhat cyclic even, leading to opportunities even in these times.\\n Jérôme Verony: It feels similar in magnitude and duration. Fundamentally, the sector keeps expanding, and there is an increasing amount of information to take in and process, making it difficult for retail investors to make sound decisions on their own. BioSci Capital Partners: We believe that the 2018 biotech downturn can be more prolonged that will extend into the second half of 2019. One of the elements of Integrated BioSci Investing is being opportunistic. Despite that many investors are fearful of a bear market, we view it as one of the best opportunities to build shares in fundamentally strong companies to hold for the long haul. Nonetheless, we must caution investors to take a step-wise approach toward building shares rather than going \"all in.\" That way you can have a lower averaging cost. Accordingly, we selected our top picks that are positioned to survive this bear market as well as to thrive in the subsequent bull market cycle. Wall Street Titan: A look at a chart reveals the difference. The Nasdaq Biotechnology Index (NBI) got way ahead of the overall market starting in the second quarter of 2014 and outperformed the S&P 500 by a whopping 83% from trough to peak in about 15 months, a strong indication of irrational exuberance. In July 2015, the NBI started its relative reversal and gave up 85% of that outperformance in just six months. This time around the correlation between the NBI and the SPX is much tighter. It seems like it\\'s more of an overall market reset this time. \\n\\n ^NABIOTR data by YCharts Terry Chrisomalis: The biotech sector has been weak due to many market conditions. I would say that the year 2015 and 2018 are both similar and different depending upon what context is being noted. This involves a multitude of issues in 2018 such as rate hikes from the Fed, the tax issue with China, and many other market issues. I would say that 2018 is different compared to 2015 when talking about the items noted above. In addition, these problems that are taking place in 2018 are causing the stock market to trade lower by hundreds of points each day, which was not seen as much in 2015. Another stark difference is that there have been more drug approvals in 2018 compared to 2015. There were 56 drug approvals by the FDA in 2018; however, in 2015, there were only 45 instead. This is likely due to the leniency of the FDA under the leadership of Scott Gottlieb. There is one crucial similarity that still plagues the biotech sector today. This involves drug pricing. That was back in 2015 when Turing Pharmaceuticals increased Daraprim from $13.50 per pill to $700 per pill. This caused outrage from the leadership in Washington at that time. The point is that the same excessive drug price hikes exist today in 2018 as well. They will likely also be an issue in 2019, because many big pharmaceuticals already have plans to hike their prices early on. Unless lawmakers step in, this will be an ongoing issue in the coming year.\\n ONeil Trader: In 2018, there is no major theme for the downtrend, at least I see it that way. In 2015, we saw the price gouging frenzy that turned into nothing. Of course, drug pricing is an evergreen subject. There are areas where I believe drug companies are very vulnerable, and those are mainly crowded areas with no differentiation between one product over the other and even more so the generic industry. The FDA is making significant strides to increase the number of generic drug approvals and that, in turn, should lead to more competition and lower prices of generic drugs, and lower revenues and profits for generic manufacturers. SA: Biotech doesn\\'t seem to lend itself to buy-and-hold investing - even in a successful pre-trial period, stocks will bounce up and down as the market turns its gaze to the next event. Do you buy this, and how do you position your portfolio in light of this? Jonathan Faison: I believe that each story is unique and what\\'s important is to hold a biotech stock through the phase of maximum value creation. For some companies, that could mean playing the run-up to a regulatory or clinical catalyst, while for others a \"buy-and-hold\" approach appears warranted if attractive across a multi-year time frame. Additionally, it depends on one\\'s own personal preference - a trader could have played the run-up to NovoCure\\'s (NVCR) mesothelioma data this year (from $20 to over $50, taking partial profits along the way). On the other hand, a \"buy-and-hold\" investor would be justified to take advantage of recent weakness on sales growth concerns to be positioned ahead of phase 3 readouts across multiple indications in coming years. For me personally, I prefer to find stocks to hold over the near to medium term (anywhere from a few months to over a year or more if the thesis continues to strengthen). Slingshot Insights: Biotech companies are driven by news flow. It is very important to be aware of key catalysts coming up for a name as well as news vacuums; both can move stocks. Our approach is to understand the catalyst landscape, do significant diligence on those events and take positions based on that work. That is why at Slingshot Insights, we spend so much time interviewing experts about their views on data and drugs.\\n Early Retiree: This is an interesting question since everybody would tend to agree instinctively, but on the other hand, everybody also knows that the most successful biotech investors are of the buy-and-hold species. Just think of the well-known names: Omega, NEA, Cormorant, Baupost, Perceptive Advisors, etc. In Stability & Opportunity, we try to profit from the short-term focus of the biotech crowd. We like volatility, as it allows to buy low and sell high. We avoid the names everybody is tweeting about and concentrate our efforts on just a few high-quality stocks which are almost totally flying under the radar and have a high probability of long-term success coupled with a very low probability of permanent loss of capital.  Avisol Capital Partners: As long as you are talking about small-cap biotech, I am on the same page. Biotech needs a lot more active investing than most sectors. Investors need to read and research a lot, tune in to forums, Twitter and so on, and generally keep themselves informed on a daily basis. That\\'s how we try to manage our portfolio. We keep a trance for the longer term, but we use about half of our individual positions to constantly buy and sell, taking advantage of the cyclical movements we see here. And we never hold beyond a PDUFA for small-caps. Lately, we have warned our readers against this because we see a lot of small-caps that do well on clinical execution but then go ahead and fail in the market. Jérôme Verony: At Second-Level Investing, I actively manage our model portfolio to \"trade around the core\" of our holdings often to take advantage of volatility that is not premised on news or other fundamental considerations. BioSci Capital Partners: Biotech is definitely a different beast due to the nature of the associated \"binary event\" of young bioscience companies. As a \"make or break\" event, a binary catalyst can be a clinical trial reporting, a regulatory approval, or a development and commercialization partnership. Despite the high volatility associated with such catalysts, there are companies that are still good for long-term holding. Such companies tend to have a highly favorable chance of posting positive clinical outcomes for their lead drug, a sizable market for their drugs-in-development, and an excellent management team. While we prefer our long-term holding approach, we also believe that investors who are into trading can have a separate trading account to potentially capture the profits that arise from a positive binary event. At IBI, we specialize in clinical and regulatory forecasting, yet we also conduct merger & acquisition analysis. Some equities that we featured got acquired include Kite Pharma, Juno Therapeutics, Corium International (NASDAQ:CORI), and Tesaro (TSRO).\\n Wall Street Titan: When discussing small cap biotechs, that certainly is the case. It\\'s not only the actual progress the company is making or the pitfalls it encounters, but it is also investor perceptions that play a huge role. As far as my portfolio, don\\'t put large portion of your assets into and single biotech, or any single sector for that matter and keep a healthy cash balance to help ride out the volatility and to allow you to pounce when market dislocations arise. Clover Biotech Research: As we\\'ve seen of recent, biotechnology stocks can be particularly vulnerable to market headwinds. After all, many of the companies I cover are not bringing in any revenue and are, therefore, subject to wild price swings for no good reason. To be successful, a person investing in biotechnology must have a long-term mindset. I position my portfolio in that I am aware some stories may take a while to play out. Some positions may depreciate a great amount before coming to fruition. I would advise people to have realistic expectations for yourself and your investments. Set time frames and price targets. Above all, set reasonably achievable goals for yourself and for your positions. Terry Chrisomalis: The biotech sector is one the riskiest sectors in my opinion. This is because it falls under the drug hype phenomenon. By that I mean, investors are focused on how well a drug does. Whether or not it passes a mid-stage study or late-stage study. In the short-term, it will pop the stock higher maybe by 50% or more. However, the point is correct in that buy-and-hold investing is very difficult to manage. That\\'s because after the stock of a biotech trades higher on data, it may trade lower after on a weak market. In addition, it is prudent to read the SEC filings of the biotech to see how well its cash position is. The reason why this is important is because you can read what the market does in terms of dilution. Biotechs will estimate how much cash is necessary to carry the company forward. If it states that it has cash for the next 12 months, it will likely raise 6 to 8 months out before then. This logic is getting ahead of the market, which is how I shift my strategy around. Buy and hold works, but I think it is best to have a multi-dimensional approach around it. In other words, hold a swing trade position in a biotech and then hold a long core position. For example, if you get the stock to jump 200% on good data, then take profit off the table from the swing trade. From there, you can keep your core position locked in. My best advice if you are going to do a buy-and-hold approach is to diversify into a lot of different stocks. Biotech is risky as I noted and typically you only need one to hit it big if it makes it.\\n ONeil Trader: I believe biotech is not too much different than other industries or sectors other than being more volatile. Over time, I have started focusing more on the overall story behind the company rather than a particular catalyst since I\\'ve found the catalysts too often result in disappointing near-term returns, even if the catalyst was positive. I am also focusing more on companies with multiple real shots on goal rather than single product and more specifically single-indication products. That way, I have higher odds of investing success and less downside risk. SA: What was the big story or lesson learned for you in 2018? Jonathan Faison: One of my guidelines is that when I have a series of poor trades or those that simply didn\\'t work out, it\\'s best to raise more cash in order to \"sleep well at night\" and then cautiously work my way into new positions. However, in the second half of the year, my losses were compounded and some of the decline was avoidable as I failed to take enough of a step back to gain some perspective. Additionally, I was reminded of the importance of sticking with charts showing strength or at least stability (they are often the ones that hold up best during periods of correction or volatility) instead of buying dips in stories with deteriorating fundamentals. Slingshot Insights: Biotech is a high beta sector. So macro can impact it more than others. Early Retiree: Dilution can kill you, especially when coupled with other unlucky circumstances which on their own wouldn\\'t have done that much harm. While I have criticized Paratek (PRTK) for its frequent surprising capital raises, these cautious moves now look like pure genius. Achaogen (AKAO) is the poster child for everything that can possibly go wrong in this respect. The stock traded for $11 when I was fighting my public battle with the many high-conviction longs out there. It has lost 85% since then. Even I had not expected such a carnage, however, so I will be even more cautious on dilution going forward.\\n Avisol Capital Partners: This was a lesson that was reinforced for us in 2018 - that small-caps go down after approval. I have discussed this in multiple articles recently. Yes, there are exceptions - for indicators of which stock could be such an exception, look at cash management, a clear trial data, low competition, and management\\'s market capabilities. However, in general, we have learned - or rather, re-learned a known lesson - that it is never a good idea to hold onto a small-cap biotech - with a single lead candidate - beyond PDUFA. Jérôme Verony: As far as SMID-cap biotech is concerned: never underestimate how volatile and irrational markets can be. SMID-cap biotechs are at the same time vulnerable to stock-specific catalysts, to developments by their competitors and to macro sentiment (risk on/risk off) in the markets. But they can also move considerably without any fundamental developments. One thing that hasn\\'t changed from when I began dabbling in this sector about six years ago is that investors are perpetually trying to time their entries and exits, which tends to be a risky proposition. BioSci Capital Partners: A big story that we learned in 2018 is Tesaro. The company has a history of doing what other analysts coined \"PR stunts\" that they are in discussion with suitors. All previous rumors about a merger and acquisition did not bear fruits. Nonetheless, we noted that the company has a highly invaluable asset, niraparib, that is most likely going to be approved as the first-line management for ovarian cancer. It also has a very good chance of eventually be FDA-approved as a treatment to service the lucrative prostate cancer market. Amid the bear market, we believe that the chances of getting bought out are quite high because a bear market is \"buyer\\'s market.\" Large pharmaceuticals companies that want to acquire synergistic assets can do so at a deep bargain. In December, GlaxoSmithKline (NYSE:GSK) scooped up Tesaro\\'s shares for $5.1B. That story reinforced our core belief in the data itself rather than the general market expectations. We didn\\'t use hindsight but rather foresight in that analysis. A big lesson that we learned in 2018 is that investors should take some profits on an ultra-performing bioscience stock because it can lose most values in the short-term. However, it is important to keep around 50% of the shares to ride further upsides.\\n Wall Street Titan: When you have that feeling in your bones that the market is starting to turn south, it probably is. Clover Biotech Research: Having an FDA-approved product doesn\\'t translate to stock success. We\\'ve seen the perils surrounding stocks like Synergy Pharmaceuticals (SGYP) and Achaogen that have lost nearly 90% of their market capitalization since their products reached the market. This is one reason why I prefer investing in companies developing drugs for unmet needs (orphan drugs). Terry Chrisomalis: The biggest lesson I learned is to track hints of the market situation. In addition, not to be locked in and fall in love with a biotech stock. A lot of times you have to make a hard decision as an investor to cut your losses when you see that things aren\\'t going well. That doesn\\'t mean to give up entirely, because biotechs tend to have large pipelines with about 5 to 10 indications. However, there are ways you can tell if the technology in question is either working in the intended target population or it isn\\'t. ONeil Trader: Outliers can make a big impact on one\\'s portfolio performance and that we should hold on to our winners and get rid of losers, though I would like to make a distinction between a fundamental loser and a price loser (but they are often both). My outlier in 2018 was Amarin (AMRN). I held the stock since late 2016 and have made significant gains in 2018 after the company reported overwhelmingly positive REDUCE-IT results. I have taken some profits in October, but mainly because my position was becoming too big, I still like the story very much, and it remains my largest holding as of this writing. SA: What do you enjoy about investing in biotech? Jonathan Faison: I\\'m fascinated by the potential of these companies to dramatically improve the lives of patients and I enjoy digging into each story, potentially uncovering certain nuggets that get overlooked. Additionally, I find the community of biotech investors to be very welcoming in that due diligence is generously shared (e.g., in comments section of articles) and constructive criticism is freely given.\\n Slingshot Insights: The complexity of the industry and high stake data read-outs make it possible to consistently profit from wise investments. Early Retiree: You usually want to buy from somebody who doesn\\'t really know what he is selling. In biotech, this is more likely, given the extreme short-term focus of most investors in this space, which should actually be one of the most long-term-oriented segments of the market, given the lengthy development times of drug pipelines. Moreover, since biotech is complex and few are willing to invest the necessary time for a thorough analysis, in this game, many investors follow sell-side reports almost blindly. But the sell-side is actually very likely to be wrong, especially in biotech, due to its even greater conflict of interest compared to other market sectors. Biotechs often raise capital, which the sell-side wants to facilitate and therefore tends to create nice stories, while systematically ignoring risks and dilution. This doesn\\'t necessarily mean that every stock under sell-side coverage is overvalued, but many remain misunderstood even while they are getting lots of attention, as the sell-side focuses on just that part of the story that is easier to sell, while giving short shrift to the rest. This creates opportunities for patient investors willing to do the hard work necessary for a truly independent valuation. Avisol Capital Partners: The heart of the matter? I enjoy the fact that while I get to play a cool betting game with Mr. Market, somewhere, some sick child or an elderly patient is getting cured of some terrible disease whether I win some or lose some today. If you take everything out of the equation, this is about healing and helping. And I enjoy the fact that I get to make some money along the way, too. This isn\\'t something that can be said about many other sectors. For example, if your oil stock is doing very well today, that means you are making money by polluting this already heavily-polluted world. But if your bio stock does well, that may mean a great new drug has arrived in the developed world today, and 7 or 10 years later, the entire world will reap its benefits.\\n Jérôme Verony: I love that it\\'s a constant challenge and a learning process. As a corollary, it has put me in touch with equally interesting people in the investment community and on the industry side. BioSci Capital Partners: We enjoy the intellectual challenges of putting together various puzzle pieces that are needed in forecasting a binary event. As we mentioned, a binary event can be the outcomes of a clinical trial, a potential merger and acquisition as well as a drug approval. That aside, we enjoy helping investors with an ultra-long-term approach to position their portfolios to profit big from the bioscience sector. For instance, the SPDR S&P Biotech, an ETF comprising of small-cap bioscience equities, outperformed all other benchmarks that we know of. We also enjoyed integrating our various perspectives in medicine, science, drug development as well as commercialization to provide an analysis for our readers. Most importantly, we enjoy learning from our readers as much as in sharing our ideas. Wall Street Titan: First of all the opportunity to make outsized returns is no doubt the main attraction. However, I also love the science as I find it fascinating and often mysterious. So much so that I attended a course called \"Biohacker Boot Camp\" at genspace.org in Brooklyn, NY, last year and had time in a real lab where students sampled their own DNA. Speaking of science, I published a very in-depth article on the science behind the Athersys (ATHX) stem cell treatment for stroke about two years ago. I am still fascinated by the science but still waiting, somewhat impatiently, for the outsized returns. Terry Chrisomalis: Biotech for me is enjoyable because of the risk involved, and the ability to track the clinical data. I\\'m interested in understanding the p-values in studies, the response rates, and other measures. In addition, I like to see how the drugs that are developed affect patients\\' lives. In other words, does the newly approved drug improve the quality of life for patients? For me, it\\'s also a little bit of a victory that a drug has finally been developed to treat patients with a disease that keeps them alive. A lot of people get caught up in the trial side aspect and forget that the patients that enroll in these studies are real human beings. The most notable thing for me in biotech is the science. I like to look at new technologies in biotech that are advancing our knowledge of treating a multitude of diseases. Some examples of such items include RNAi technology, CAR-T cells, gene therapy, monoclonal antibodies, bispecific antibodies, adoptive cell therapies, and many other treatments that are utilized.\\n ONeil Trader: The science is incredible. Biotech companies are looking to develop therapies that make people\\'s lives substantially better to cure diseases and address unmet needs. Investors get an incredible amount of data that aren\\'t available in other industries. The product profiles are defined by efficacy and safety and we can make comparisons to competing products. It\\'s a really challenging area (isn\\'t investing hard overall?) but rewards can be great. SA: The broader market has been fairly volatile. Let\\'s say we enter a sustained correction or bear market - how would biotech investing fit into that backdrop? Jonathan Faison: As a higher-risk, high-beta sector, biotech stocks are often punished even more than the rest of the market and thus could suffer substantially in the event of an outsized correction. That said, companies that deliver gamechanging clinical results or bring novel medicines to markets of high unmet need are often rewarded regardless. Additionally, we are in a period where innovation is being rewarded by an increasingly receptive and efficient FDA. At the same time, there are many companies pursuing similar approaches or indications (just look at the explosion in # of CAR-T programs in clinical trials or gene therapy companies targeting the same tiny rare disease indications)- such companies that offer an undifferentiated approach or those with only preclinical assets (often came to market lured by additional funding to be raised) are also likely to yield poor returns. Slingshot Insights: An even greater focus on catalyst driven investing. In a world of contracting valuations, buy and hold is the kiss of death for a biotech investor. Pick the event, execute the strategy and get out. Early Retiree: All sectors offer bargains every once in a while and a difficult market environment will only increase the likelihood of market inefficiencies. Since I\\'ve been accumulating cash for some time now, I am happy if prices come down. Investors who only during corrections remember how uncertain the future is should not invest at all and certainly not in biotech. That said, in the worst moments of the GFC, when financing was basically impossible even for more robust companies, a widely respected and cautious value investor like Seth Klarman accumulated large positions in several biotech stocks which subsequently did quite well. The foundation of value investing is that sometimes you can have your cake and eat it, too, i.e. that there is such a thing as a low-risk, high-reward investment. You just have to find it - which is very, very difficult and requires a lot of hard work.\\n Avisol Capital Partners: I have said this before - a bear market is an opportunity for intelligent biotech investors. Individual small-cap biotech don\\'t face macro headwinds as much as other sectors or megacap biotech. So there\\'s always opportunity that way. The other opportunity in a bear market is that small-cap biotechs run through a system - the regulatory, clinical trial system - and it isn\\'t logical to suppose that a stock that was doing well in its early clinical phase just because of the broad market will now see a huge fall just when it received approval for a potential blockbuster drug just because the broad market has turned bearish. Yes, sometimes, that happens - but opportunity lies in finding those stocks where it doesn\\'t. Jérôme Verony: I would say that biotechs with a strong cash position and a long cash runway would fare well. A great example is Denali Therapeutics (DNLI), which has at least a 3-4 year cash runway at present and which has been outperforming the indexes. High-risk and low-cash biotechs would suffer most under a prolonged correction/in a bear market. BioSci Capital Partners: The current bear market commenced with the correction of bioscience stocks, which then spread into the broader market: negative market sentiment can be quite contagious. In this bear market, we believe that the bioscience sector will experience the most drastic correction going into 2019. Because biotech will most likely lose substantial value, it\\'s quite likely that they are positioned to rebound the most at the subsequent bull market cycle. Wall Street Titan: Biotech won\\'t do well in a sustained market decline as it is a high-beta sector. You know what they say about a rising tide? It\\'s the same in reverse. Of course, within the sector, there will still be some spectacular winners and catastrophic losers. Terry Chrisomalis: This goes back to the other question alluded to above about whether to buy and hold or to trade. In a bear market, I would impose the same strategy as I alluded to before. That is to hold some long core positions and maybe average down, because the biotech in question has a large pipeline. If you have confidence, then averaging down may not be a bad thing. Especially, if the biotech has already generated positive clinical data that exudes more confidence as an investment. Then you will have some swing shares that you buy and sell on the same day. The main component for biotech goes back to the fact that it trades based on successful results. Even if there is a bear market, if a phase 3 study is successful in meeting the primary endpoint, then the stock will gap much higher. It is best to implement a strategy and stick with it.\\n ONeil Trader: I am heavily overweight biotech stocks for quite some time and especially now considering the macro uncertainty. I believe my portfolio is as uncorrelated as it can get with the macro environment. And I am not saying that in a way that I think my portfolio won\\'t drop when the market drops. It probably will. I am saying that value will be created fundamentally (through positive clinical trial results, drug approvals and similar catalysts), while it may be destroyed in other industries challenged by worsening macro conditions, and that once the weight of the market is lifted, my portfolio will gain more because of the fundamental value created during the correction or a bear market. It is also possible that there will be positive catalysts that boost my portfolio\\'s performance during periods of negative market performance. The other side of that is, of course, that my portfolio underperforms on a negative catalyst, but both can happen during bull markets and rallies and is not isolated to biotech industry in particular. SA: What are you preparing for in 2019? Any big themes to watch out for? Jonathan Faison: One area that\\'s particularly attractive to me is companies with mid- or late-stage assets targeting indications of high unmet need which have important clinical or regulatory catalysts in 2019 (i.e., phase 3 readout or PDUFA date). Quite a few have significant downside cushion or elements of derisking via promising data generated thus far and valuations have come back down as a result of recent volatility. Additionally, as such assets appear unique with no or few alternatives while targeting large market opportunities, it wouldn\\'t be unexpected for a few to be acquired by larger pharma concerns. Slingshot Insights: We\\'re looking for valuations to bottom out and some attractive assets to be repriced in a way that makes them interesting. We think 2019 will be a year of a lot of names shaking out and early IPO companies (little to no clinical data) seeing severe valuation crunches.\\n Early Retiree: Contrary to many investors, I don\\'t think that the trade war with China is actually that important. It is a show artificially created by Donald Trump and he can and will stop it sooner or later and certainly if it becomes dangerous. I also don\\'t think Brexit will be that important since I believe that the UK will inevitably keep very close ties with the EU anyway. But I do believe that the EU will make (and will have to make) a decisive move in 2019: either towards more unity or towards greater disaggregation and an even more acute impossibility to reform itself. This move will have an important impact on financial markets and maybe the current correction partly anticipates the related risks. The EU will vote for a new parliament in 2019 and unpredictable anti-establishment movements will likely do very well in several key countries like France, Italy and even Germany. How this will play out is anyone\\'s guess. While the EU is certainly the very cause of some of the mess it currently finds itself in, thanks to its united efforts, it has also managed to muddle through and control that mess. With an even less united EU, it could suddenly explode. Avisol Capital Partners: I am looking to see developments in NASH, gene editing, CAR-T. On the risk side, I am closely watching the fate of Obamacare. Jérôme Verony: I am an asset-specific investor above all else. I look for exceptional and/or undervalued molecules and platforms. As such, I look for intrinsic value rather than stocks that are driven by investor sentiment. One \"theme\" that a lot of biotech investors are currently yearning for is a resurgence in M&A activity. After a lackluster 2018, many expect a more fruitful 2019. However, the marked acceleration in share buyback programs across blue chip stocks, which includes big pharma and big biotech, gives me pause - it suggests that cash-rich businesses are very inward looking at present. Another theme to watch out for with Democrats in charge of the House, and the President being receptive to proposals to lower drug pricing, is policy. Senator Warren just proposed that the government manufacture generic drugs under certain conditions. It\\'s an alluring proposition which is already garnering support from health economists. If implemented, it would provide the government with something it hasn\\'t dabbled in before - drug manufacturing capabilities and know-how.\\n BioSci Capital Partners: We\\'ve prepared a list of our five stars stocks. Companies that made this list are those that we believe will enjoy the most robust share price appreciation at the subsequent bull market cycle. These are bioscience companies having the strong balance sheet, excellent assets in development, large addressable market, good market penetration, and stellar management. One big theme for 2019 would be the extensive clinical advancement of immune checkpoint inhibitors with various flagship molecule like cabozantinib of Exelixis (NASDAQ:EXEL) or NKTR-214 of Nektar Therapeutics (NASDAQ:NKTR). These companies are investigating their potential applications in a vast number of cancer indications. Another big theme will be the advancement of various molecules to potentially treat nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (\"NASH\") which is a $25B market without an approved medicine. Wall Street Titan: I\\'ll be watching out to see how the CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing companies progress in their pipeline. This is the cutting edge (some might say bleeding) of medicine, and while the upside is enormous, it is fraught with the possibility of setbacks. Editing the human genome still seems like science fiction to many. Who would have thought it was even possible, just a decade ago. Clover Biotech Research: The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) prides itself in approving more drugs than ever before. We should see the same theme carry into 2019. There are three companies/stocks that I believe will actually benefit from FDA-approval in the new year: Global Blood Therapeutics (GBT), Fennec Pharmaceuticals (FENC), and Zogenix (ZGNX). All of these companies are developing a therapeutic for an orphan condition with limited treatment options. Unlike Synergy and Achaogen, all three should benefit from swift market uptake and big pharma interest. Terry Chrisomalis: I\\'m preparing to see how the stock market starts off in 2019. I wouldn\\'t go crazy and start buying every biotech that I would like. The reason for this is because it important to first track if all the negative instances in 2018 have gone away. For example, big pharmaceutical companies are going to raise prices in early 2019. If politicians come after these companies, then expect the biotech sector to be hit really hard. Another item to watch for which is important would be FDA approvals, in terms of how many come about. At least in 2018 there was a higher-than-expected amount of FDA approvals, hopefully the trend can be continued in 2019. Other than some of these trends, the most important will be the Fed itself in terms of rate hikes. That\\'s because if 2018 taught me anything, it was that the Fed has massive power to cause a bear market. The Fed recently announced that it expects two rate hike increases in 2019. These may end up being deterrents again for the stock market. In turn, that could cause another bear market for all stocks including biotechs.\\n ONeil Trader: I am preparing, as I always am, to optimize my portfolio, to get rid of stocks that are not executing and continue to search for new promising portfolio candidates. I don\\'t see a specific investing theme, but drug pricing may be an overall theme of the year considering the Democrats\\' takeover of Congress and drug pricing topping their agenda. However, I do not believe anything meaningful gets done with a split government, and if something gets done through bipartisan efforts, the vast majority of initiatives that I\\'ve seen to date are unlikely to have a big fundamental impact on drug companies\\' revenues and profits, or at least those I am focusing on. Return of biotech M&A is another potential theme (though I wouldn\\'t really count on it when making investing decisions, in 2019 or ever). I believe big biotech/pharma companies are starving for growth assets, and there are some attractive assets to purchase in the small and mid-cap space. SA: What is one of your best ideas for 2019, and what is the story? Early Retiree: Besides several great non-biotech ideas we are covering in Stability & Opportunity, there is one no-brainer in biotech that comes to my mind. Protagonist (PTGX) is trading for $160 million with net cash of about $130 million, so, first of all, we are getting its pipeline almost for free. This includes three drugs, and two of these are phase-2-ready: A phase 2 drug in ß-thalassemia with a $1-2B total addressable market, a phase 1, oral, gut-selective α4ß7-integrin antagonist in UC with blockbuster potential, plus a development partnership with Janssen (which is also a major shareholder) potentially worth $1B of \"biobucks\" for another potential blockbuster in Crohn\\'s disease, which has just successfully completed phase 1. Few investors know that prior to its IPO Protagonist had actually received partnership bids for the α4ß7-integrin antagonist program, where the upfront payment was higher than its current market cap. This is due to the fact that α4ß7-integrin blockers are considered the safest approach in IBD. There is only one injectable drug (Entyvio, a blockbuster) and no competition for Protagonist\\'s potential oral drug. However, given the highly attractive prospects of this program, the company decided to enter only the Janssen partnership and develop the α4ß7-integrin antagonist on its own. The story is obviously much more complicated, but this short overview already gives you an idea of how unjustifiably cheap the company is, when the market attributes close to zero value to its pipeline. Perceptive Advisors and BVF have recently acquired large stakes.\\n Avisol Capital Partners: Amarin (AMRN). The story is REDUCE-IT data, the immense potential of Vascepa in the CV market. I have discussed this at length. The risk is the question raised around the trial design, specifically the use of mineral oil and its effect on the results. If this risk is mitigated - as I am hoping it will - then, once Vascepa gets approved for the expanded label sometime in 2019, I think we should see a fairly decent spike from these subdued levels. Jérôme Verony: I\\'ll stick with a carry-over from last year\\'s roundtable: ganaxolone, a synthetic neurosteroid developed by Marinus Pharmaceuticals (MRNS), is a seriously undervalued CNS asset. The company just posted positive data from a placebo-controlled dose escalation study in post-partum depression, a 400k patient/year opportunity. Additionally, the company is evaluating the molecule in 2 orphan drug indications: a PhIII trial is ongoing in children with CDKL5 deficiency disorder and a PhII trial is ongoing in refractory status epilepticus. The company also appears poised to move forward with a PhIII trial in children who suffer from epilepsy due to PCDH19 mutations. In 2019, we will have preliminary results from the ongoing PhII trial in RSE as well as definite dosing for the IV to oral switch in PPD. I also expect partnership activity around one of these programs, or an outright acquisition of the company, to materialize in the coming year. BioSci Capital Partners: Our best idea for 2019 is Regenxbio (NASDAQ:RGNX). The company is powering by the next generation AAV gene delivery technology coined NAV. The aforementioned vector leverages on the previous setback of AVV to deliver what has been excellent clinical outcomes. It\\'s quite promising that over 12 different companies are employing NAV to innovate gene therapies for +20 different indications. We believe that many of these trials will procure excellent results. As more positive data rolls in, companies that are using NAV will be excellent acquisition targets. A prime example is AveXis that was bought out by Novartis (NYSE:NVS) for $8.4B back on April 2018.\\n Wall Street Titan: As SA readers know, I have covered Athersys for a number of years and still awaiting for a big pay day. I\\'m still excited by its MultiStem cell therapy program for stroke and would refer readers to the many articles I have written about the company. More recently, I added an early stage biotech to my holdings called AgeX Therapeutics (AGE). AgeX is a recent spinoff from BioTime (BTX) with cutting-edge biotech technologies called PureStem® and induced Tissue Regeneration (iTR™). The company hopes to use these platforms to develop innovative medicines designed to address some of the largest unsolved problems in aging. Prior to the November 28th spinoff, AgeX received an independent validation of its technology through the purchase of 14.4 million shares at $3.00 per by Juvenescence Limited, a life science and biotech company developing therapies to increase healthy human longevity. These shares were sold by BioTime in a private transaction. With AGE shares dropping below this $3.00 arm\\'s length valuation benchmark due to the market selloff, I believe it represents an interesting opportunity. AgeX is a very early stage company, but I think it could become a story stock, at some point, with all the aging baby boomer investors out there as a prime audience. Of the 35,830,000 shares outstanding, 45.8% and 4.8% are owned by Juvenescence Limited and BioTime, respectively, so the low float could make this an interesting play with the right set of circumstances. As with any early-stage preclinical biotech, it is risky. I would refer interested readers to page 82 of this AgeX information statement for a deep dive into the science of aging, a topic that should be very interesting to all. Clover Biotech Research: Minerva Neurosciences (NERV) will have a few readouts in 2019 that are worth paying close attention to. Such indications include insomnia, depression, and schizophrenia. The latter is the most interesting to me because there are no FDA-approved treatments for the negative symptoms associated with schizophrenia. Minerva\\'s under-the-radar drug is in a position to change the treatment landscape for schizophrenia with a phase 3 readout pegged for later next year. Robust phase 2 data and a phase 3 trial designed to repeat the former\\'s success should bode well for Minerva\\'s valuation.\\n Terry Chrisomalis: My best idea for 2019 is CytoDyn (OTCQB:CYDY), because it is gearing up for an important 2019. First, it expects to file a BLA for approval of its Pro-140 combination HIV therapy in Q1 of 2019. From there, it expects to expand its label to use Pro-140 as a monotherapy. This biotech has even started to expand to other diseases using Pro-140, which is a monoclonal antibody. Other target indications include: Graft-versus-host-disease, prostate cancer, triple-negative breast cancer, and many others. In essence I like this biotech because Pro-140 is adaptable and can be used to target many diseases. I like the story because the drug works in treating HIV both as a combination therapy and monotherapy which are large markets. Like many biotech stocks there are many risks here. The first is that it trades on the OTC stock market, that means the stock is highly volatile. In addition, if CytoDyn eventually chooses to uplist to the NASDAQ or NYSE, there will likely have to be a reverse split. The final risk involves whether or not the entire BLA package can be submitted on time in Q1 of 2019. The company is low on cash, and it may need to seek a partner to get things funded. However, there is one thing that can\\'t be disputed much. Pro-140 actually has proven itself in a phase 3 study in treating HIV patients. If it does obtain BLA approval, patients will be able to treat themselves once a week at home with a subcutaneous injection of Pro-140. The combination treatment of Pro-140 is $1.2 billion, with the monotherapy expansion label of Pro-140 bringing the market potential to $3.8 billion. ONeil Trader: I have quite a few stocks I like for 2019, but am singling out what I believe to be the safest of them and with catalysts - Supernus (SUPN). The stock is trading at depressed levels despite the company not making bad moves or reporting negative clinical trial results. The company\\'s two products, Trokendi and Oxtellar, have delivered solid sales growth. Oxtellar\\'s label was recently expanded to include epilepsy monotherapy (it was only approved as adjunct therapy until early December), which should expand its market considerably and the company reported positive phase 3 results of SPN-812 in children and adolescents with ADHD (though the market was disappointed with the lack of upside on the efficacy side to an already marketed competing product). At current levels (the stock is trading in the low 30s as I write this), I believe the stock is undervalued based on its approved product portfolio alone. SPN-812 only adds to the stock\\'s upside potential at these levels, and so does SPN-810 and the company has a robust balance sheet, and it is likely to use it to expand its pipeline in the following quarters. SPN-810 itself could be a major catalyst for the stock in 2019 - phase 3 trial results in impulsive aggression in ADHD are due in mid-2019. And the beauty of this catalyst, at least for me, is that Supernus will be fine and still have more than decent upside if SPN-810 fails, and the upside is considerable if the trial is a success. So, it\\'s essentially a binary event for SPN-810, but I firmly believe not a single dollar is assigned to the success of this asset. There is more to the story than this, but these are the most important things to focus on in 2019.\\n *** Thanks to our guests for running these biotech questions through their labs.

We\\'re using the end of the year as a chance to lift our heads, survey the market, and see what might be coming ahead. To do so, we\\'re inviting our Marketplace authors to do a series of roundtables. 2018 was another steady growth year for the platform, and we have a lot of great voices on the Marketplace, so we wanted to share their perspective with you. Our Year End Marketplace Roundtable series will run through the first full market week in January. We\\'ll feature ten different roundtable discussions, with expert panels chiming in on Tech, Energy, Dividends, Other Income strategies, Gold, Value Investing, Small-Caps, Alternative Investing Strategies, Biotech, and the Macro Outlook. This roundtable looks at biotech, which has taken it on the chin like much of the market. We ask our panelists how they adjust their biotech investing in down markets, what they enjoy about the sector, and what ideas and themes are on their horizon:   Jonathan Faison, author of ROTY   Slingshot Insights, author of Become The Smart Money   Early Retiree, author of Stability & Opportunity   Avisol Capital Partners, author of The Total Pharma Tracker   Jérôme Verony, author of Second-Level Investing   BioSci Capital Partners, author of Integrated BioSci Investing   Wall Street Titan, author of Stem Cell News and Analysis   Clover Biotech Research, author of The Formula   Terry Chrisomalis, author of Biotech Analysis Central   ONeil Trader, author of Growth Stock Forum  \\n Seeking Alpha: 2018 was the most sustained down-period for biotech since 2015. How is this time similar or different to that time? Slingshot Insights: I think they are similar in that there has been a surge in VC investment and IPOs. The \"sector\" discussion has been around drug pricing. The reality is that science is advancing at the same pace or faster, M&A is still very likely given balance sheets (cash available, not debt needed). Biotech in particular can be revalued by macro trends, which creates buying opportunities rather than structural, long-term weakness. Early Retiree: In 2015, the generic pricing bubble exploded and, for some time, markets tried to gauge how much and what exactly would change from a regulatory standpoint. So far, lawmakers haven\\'t really changed that much, while market participants have adjusted to the new reality. In Stability & Opportunity, we have followed very closely the debate around Express Scripts (ESRX) and PBMs in general. All PBMs are now back under the roofs of insurers, which is likely helping them to preserve their share of pharma profits. So, from this point of view, business could go on as usual - but on the other hand, the self-correcting mechanisms of free markets have worked and pricing is under pressure without any intervention from lawmakers. This is the story of the 2018 decline: There are just too many biotechs targeting the very same large indications. Even if only a small part of the current global pipeline will effectively be launched, competition will inevitably pressure prices. In addition, the FDA is finally accelerating the approval of generics. The market is taking notice, and this is keeping down valuations. By focusing on clearly differentiated treatments with little potential competition, investors can take advantage of the broad-based price drop. Avisol Capital Partners: The 2015 biotech bloodbath was caused by specific events beginning with that infamous Hilary Clinton speech. So the fall was sudden and spectacular. 2018 doesn\\'t have such climactic events leading to the down period. So the 2018 fall is more extended, somewhat cyclic even, leading to opportunities even in these times.\\n Jérôme Verony: It feels similar in magnitude and duration. Fundamentally, the sector keeps expanding, and there is an increasing amount of information to take in and process, making it difficult for retail investors to make sound decisions on their own. BioSci Capital Partners: We believe that the 2018 biotech downturn can be more prolonged that will extend into the second half of 2019. One of the elements of Integrated BioSci Investing is being opportunistic. Despite that many investors are fearful of a bear market, we view it as one of the best opportunities to build shares in fundamentally strong companies to hold for the long haul. Nonetheless, we must caution investors to take a step-wise approach toward building shares rather than going \"all in.\" That way you can have a lower averaging cost. Accordingly, we selected our top picks that are positioned to survive this bear market as well as to thrive in the subsequent bull market cycle. Wall Street Titan: A look at a chart reveals the difference. The Nasdaq Biotechnology Index (NBI) got way ahead of the overall market starting in the second quarter of 2014 and outperformed the S&P 500 by a whopping 83% from trough to peak in about 15 months, a strong indication of irrational exuberance. In July 2015, the NBI started its relative reversal and gave up 85% of that outperformance in just six months. This time around the correlation between the NBI and the SPX is much tighter. It seems like it\\'s more of an overall market reset this time. \\n\\n ^NABIOTR data by YCharts Terry Chrisomalis: The biotech sector has been weak due to many market conditions. I would say that the year 2015 and 2018 are both similar and different depending upon what context is being noted. This involves a multitude of issues in 2018 such as rate hikes from the Fed, the tax issue with China, and many other market issues. I would say that 2018 is different compared to 2015 when talking about the items noted above. In addition, these problems that are taking place in 2018 are causing the stock market to trade lower by hundreds of points each day, which was not seen as much in 2015. Another stark difference is that there have been more drug approvals in 2018 compared to 2015. There were 56 drug approvals by the FDA in 2018; however, in 2015, there were only 45 instead. This is likely due to the leniency of the FDA under the leadership of Scott Gottlieb. There is one crucial similarity that still plagues the biotech sector today. This involves drug pricing. That was back in 2015 when Turing Pharmaceuticals increased Daraprim from $13.50 per pill to $700 per pill. This caused outrage from the leadership in Washington at that time. The point is that the same excessive drug price hikes exist today in 2018 as well. They will likely also be an issue in 2019, because many big pharmaceuticals already have plans to hike their prices early on. Unless lawmakers step in, this will be an ongoing issue in the coming year.\\n ONeil Trader: In 2018, there is no major theme for the downtrend, at least I see it that way. In 2015, we saw the price gouging frenzy that turned into nothing. Of course, drug pricing is an evergreen subject. There are areas where I believe drug companies are very vulnerable, and those are mainly crowded areas with no differentiation between one product over the other and even more so the generic industry. The FDA is making significant strides to increase the number of generic drug approvals and that, in turn, should lead to more competition and lower prices of generic drugs, and lower revenues and profits for generic manufacturers. SA: Biotech doesn\\'t seem to lend itself to buy-and-hold investing - even in a successful pre-trial period, stocks will bounce up and down as the market turns its gaze to the next event. Do you buy this, and how do you position your portfolio in light of this? Jonathan Faison: I believe that each story is unique and what\\'s important is to hold a biotech stock through the phase of maximum value creation. For some companies, that could mean playing the run-up to a regulatory or clinical catalyst, while for others a \"buy-and-hold\" approach appears warranted if attractive across a multi-year time frame. Additionally, it depends on one\\'s own personal preference - a trader could have played the run-up to NovoCure\\'s (NVCR) mesothelioma data this year (from $20 to over $50, taking partial profits along the way). On the other hand, a \"buy-and-hold\" investor would be justified to take advantage of recent weakness on sales growth concerns to be positioned ahead of phase 3 readouts across multiple indications in coming years. For me personally, I prefer to find stocks to hold over the near to medium term (anywhere from a few months to over a year or more if the thesis continues to strengthen). Slingshot Insights: Biotech companies are driven by news flow. It is very important to be aware of key catalysts coming up for a name as well as news vacuums; both can move stocks. Our approach is to understand the catalyst landscape, do significant diligence on those events and take positions based on that work. That is why at Slingshot Insights, we spend so much time interviewing experts about their views on data and drugs.\\n Early Retiree: This is an interesting question since everybody would tend to agree instinctively, but on the other hand, everybody also knows that the most successful biotech investors are of the buy-and-hold species. Just think of the well-known names: Omega, NEA, Cormorant, Baupost, Perceptive Advisors, etc. In Stability & Opportunity, we try to profit from the short-term focus of the biotech crowd. We like volatility, as it allows to buy low and sell high. We avoid the names everybody is tweeting about and concentrate our efforts on just a few high-quality stocks which are almost totally flying under the radar and have a high probability of long-term success coupled with a very low probability of permanent loss of capital.  Avisol Capital Partners: As long as you are talking about small-cap biotech, I am on the same page. Biotech needs a lot more active investing than most sectors. Investors need to read and research a lot, tune in to forums, Twitter and so on, and generally keep themselves informed on a daily basis. That\\'s how we try to manage our portfolio. We keep a trance for the longer term, but we use about half of our individual positions to constantly buy and sell, taking advantage of the cyclical movements we see here. And we never hold beyond a PDUFA for small-caps. Lately, we have warned our readers against this because we see a lot of small-caps that do well on clinical execution but then go ahead and fail in the market. Jérôme Verony: At Second-Level Investing, I actively manage our model portfolio to \"trade around the core\" of our holdings often to take advantage of volatility that is not premised on news or other fundamental considerations. BioSci Capital Partners: Biotech is definitely a different beast due to the nature of the associated \"binary event\" of young bioscience companies. As a \"make or break\" event, a binary catalyst can be a clinical trial reporting, a regulatory approval, or a development and commercialization partnership. Despite the high volatility associated with such catalysts, there are companies that are still good for long-term holding. Such companies tend to have a highly favorable chance of posting positive clinical outcomes for their lead drug, a sizable market for their drugs-in-development, and an excellent management team. While we prefer our long-term holding approach, we also believe that investors who are into trading can have a separate trading account to potentially capture the profits that arise from a positive binary event. At IBI, we specialize in clinical and regulatory forecasting, yet we also conduct merger & acquisition analysis. Some equities that we featured got acquired include Kite Pharma, Juno Therapeutics, Corium International (NASDAQ:CORI), and Tesaro (TSRO).\\n Wall Street Titan: When discussing small cap biotechs, that certainly is the case. It\\'s not only the actual progress the company is making or the pitfalls it encounters, but it is also investor perceptions that play a huge role. As far as my portfolio, don\\'t put large portion of your assets into and single biotech, or any single sector for that matter and keep a healthy cash balance to help ride out the volatility and to allow you to pounce when market dislocations arise. Clover Biotech Research: As we\\'ve seen of recent, biotechnology stocks can be particularly vulnerable to market headwinds. After all, many of the companies I cover are not bringing in any revenue and are, therefore, subject to wild price swings for no good reason. To be successful, a person investing in biotechnology must have a long-term mindset. I position my portfolio in that I am aware some stories may take a while to play out. Some positions may depreciate a great amount before coming to fruition. I would advise people to have realistic expectations for yourself and your investments. Set time frames and price targets. Above all, set reasonably achievable goals for yourself and for your positions. Terry Chrisomalis: The biotech sector is one the riskiest sectors in my opinion. This is because it falls under the drug hype phenomenon. By that I mean, investors are focused on how well a drug does. Whether or not it passes a mid-stage study or late-stage study. In the short-term, it will pop the stock higher maybe by 50% or more. However, the point is correct in that buy-and-hold investing is very difficult to manage. That\\'s because after the stock of a biotech trades higher on data, it may trade lower after on a weak market. In addition, it is prudent to read the SEC filings of the biotech to see how well its cash position is. The reason why this is important is because you can read what the market does in terms of dilution. Biotechs will estimate how much cash is necessary to carry the company forward. If it states that it has cash for the next 12 months, it will likely raise 6 to 8 months out before then. This logic is getting ahead of the market, which is how I shift my strategy around. Buy and hold works, but I think it is best to have a multi-dimensional approach around it. In other words, hold a swing trade position in a biotech and then hold a long core position. For example, if you get the stock to jump 200% on good data, then take profit off the table from the swing trade. From there, you can keep your core position locked in. My best advice if you are going to do a buy-and-hold approach is to diversify into a lot of different stocks. Biotech is risky as I noted and typically you only need one to hit it big if it makes it.\\n ONeil Trader: I believe biotech is not too much different than other industries or sectors other than being more volatile. Over time, I have started focusing more on the overall story behind the company rather than a particular catalyst since I\\'ve found the catalysts too often result in disappointing near-term returns, even if the catalyst was positive. I am also focusing more on companies with multiple real shots on goal rather than single product and more specifically single-indication products. That way, I have higher odds of investing success and less downside risk. SA: What was the big story or lesson learned for you in 2018? Jonathan Faison: One of my guidelines is that when I have a series of poor trades or those that simply didn\\'t work out, it\\'s best to raise more cash in order to \"sleep well at night\" and then cautiously work my way into new positions. However, in the second half of the year, my losses were compounded and some of the decline was avoidable as I failed to take enough of a step back to gain some perspective. Additionally, I was reminded of the importance of sticking with charts showing strength or at least stability (they are often the ones that hold up best during periods of correction or volatility) instead of buying dips in stories with deteriorating fundamentals. Slingshot Insights: Biotech is a high beta sector. So macro can impact it more than others. Early Retiree: Dilution can kill you, especially when coupled with other unlucky circumstances which on their own wouldn\\'t have done that much harm. While I have criticized Paratek (PRTK) for its frequent surprising capital raises, these cautious moves now look like pure genius. Achaogen (AKAO) is the poster child for everything that can possibly go wrong in this respect. The stock traded for $11 when I was fighting my public battle with the many high-conviction longs out there. It has lost 85% since then. Even I had not expected such a carnage, however, so I will be even more cautious on dilution going forward.\\n Avisol Capital Partners: This was a lesson that was reinforced for us in 2018 - that small-caps go down after approval. I have discussed this in multiple articles recently. Yes, there are exceptions - for indicators of which stock could be such an exception, look at cash management, a clear trial data, low competition, and management\\'s market capabilities. However, in general, we have learned - or rather, re-learned a known lesson - that it is never a good idea to hold onto a small-cap biotech - with a single lead candidate - beyond PDUFA. Jérôme Verony: As far as SMID-cap biotech is concerned: never underestimate how volatile and irrational markets can be. SMID-cap biotechs are at the same time vulnerable to stock-specific catalysts, to developments by their competitors and to macro sentiment (risk on/risk off) in the markets. But they can also move considerably without any fundamental developments. One thing that hasn\\'t changed from when I began dabbling in this sector about six years ago is that investors are perpetually trying to time their entries and exits, which tends to be a risky proposition. BioSci Capital Partners: A big story that we learned in 2018 is Tesaro. The company has a history of doing what other analysts coined \"PR stunts\" that they are in discussion with suitors. All previous rumors about a merger and acquisition did not bear fruits. Nonetheless, we noted that the company has a highly invaluable asset, niraparib, that is most likely going to be approved as the first-line management for ovarian cancer. It also has a very good chance of eventually be FDA-approved as a treatment to service the lucrative prostate cancer market. Amid the bear market, we believe that the chances of getting bought out are quite high because a bear market is \"buyer\\'s market.\" Large pharmaceuticals companies that want to acquire synergistic assets can do so at a deep bargain. In December, GlaxoSmithKline (NYSE:GSK) scooped up Tesaro\\'s shares for $5.1B. That story reinforced our core belief in the data itself rather than the general market expectations. We didn\\'t use hindsight but rather foresight in that analysis. A big lesson that we learned in 2018 is that investors should take some profits on an ultra-performing bioscience stock because it can lose most values in the short-term. However, it is important to keep around 50% of the shares to ride further upsides.\\n Wall Street Titan: When you have that feeling in your bones that the market is starting to turn south, it probably is. Clover Biotech Research: Having an FDA-approved product doesn\\'t translate to stock success. We\\'ve seen the perils surrounding stocks like Synergy Pharmaceuticals (SGYP) and Achaogen that have lost nearly 90% of their market capitalization since their products reached the market. This is one reason why I prefer investing in companies developing drugs for unmet needs (orphan drugs). Terry Chrisomalis: The biggest lesson I learned is to track hints of the market situation. In addition, not to be locked in and fall in love with a biotech stock. A lot of times you have to make a hard decision as an investor to cut your losses when you see that things aren\\'t going well. That doesn\\'t mean to give up entirely, because biotechs tend to have large pipelines with about 5 to 10 indications. However, there are ways you can tell if the technology in question is either working in the intended target population or it isn\\'t. ONeil Trader: Outliers can make a big impact on one\\'s portfolio performance and that we should hold on to our winners and get rid of losers, though I would like to make a distinction between a fundamental loser and a price loser (but they are often both). My outlier in 2018 was Amarin (AMRN). I held the stock since late 2016 and have made significant gains in 2018 after the company reported overwhelmingly positive REDUCE-IT results. I have taken some profits in October, but mainly because my position was becoming too big, I still like the story very much, and it remains my largest holding as of this writing. SA: What do you enjoy about investing in biotech? Jonathan Faison: I\\'m fascinated by the potential of these companies to dramatically improve the lives of patients and I enjoy digging into each story, potentially uncovering certain nuggets that get overlooked. Additionally, I find the community of biotech investors to be very welcoming in that due diligence is generously shared (e.g., in comments section of articles) and constructive criticism is freely given.\\n Slingshot Insights: The complexity of the industry and high stake data read-outs make it possible to consistently profit from wise investments. Early Retiree: You usually want to buy from somebody who doesn\\'t really know what he is selling. In biotech, this is more likely, given the extreme short-term focus of most investors in this space, which should actually be one of the most long-term-oriented segments of the market, given the lengthy development times of drug pipelines. Moreover, since biotech is complex and few are willing to invest the necessary time for a thorough analysis, in this game, many investors follow sell-side reports almost blindly. But the sell-side is actually very likely to be wrong, especially in biotech, due to its even greater conflict of interest compared to other market sectors. Biotechs often raise capital, which the sell-side wants to facilitate and therefore tends to create nice stories, while systematically ignoring risks and dilution. This doesn\\'t necessarily mean that every stock under sell-side coverage is overvalued, but many remain misunderstood even while they are getting lots of attention, as the sell-side focuses on just that part of the story that is easier to sell, while giving short shrift to the rest. This creates opportunities for patient investors willing to do the hard work necessary for a truly independent valuation. Avisol Capital Partners: The heart of the matter? I enjoy the fact that while I get to play a cool betting game with Mr. Market, somewhere, some sick child or an elderly patient is getting cured of some terrible disease whether I win some or lose some today. If you take everything out of the equation, this is about healing and helping. And I enjoy the fact that I get to make some money along the way, too. This isn\\'t something that can be said about many other sectors. For example, if your oil stock is doing very well today, that means you are making money by polluting this already heavily-polluted world. But if your bio stock does well, that may mean a great new drug has arrived in the developed world today, and 7 or 10 years later, the entire world will reap its benefits.\\n Jérôme Verony: I love that it\\'s a constant challenge and a learning process. As a corollary, it has put me in touch with equally interesting people in the investment community and on the industry side. BioSci Capital Partners: We enjoy the intellectual challenges of putting together various puzzle pieces that are needed in forecasting a binary event. As we mentioned, a binary event can be the outcomes of a clinical trial, a potential merger and acquisition as well as a drug approval. That aside, we enjoy helping investors with an ultra-long-term approach to position their portfolios to profit big from the bioscience sector. For instance, the SPDR S&P Biotech, an ETF comprising of small-cap bioscience equities, outperformed all other benchmarks that we know of. We also enjoyed integrating our various perspectives in medicine, science, drug development as well as commercialization to provide an analysis for our readers. Most importantly, we enjoy learning from our readers as much as in sharing our ideas. Wall Street Titan: First of all the opportunity to make outsized returns is no doubt the main attraction. However, I also love the science as I find it fascinating and often mysterious. So much so that I attended a course called \"Biohacker Boot Camp\" at genspace.org in Brooklyn, NY, last year and had time in a real lab where students sampled their own DNA. Speaking of science, I published a very in-depth article on the science behind the Athersys (ATHX) stem cell treatment for stroke about two years ago. I am still fascinated by the science but still waiting, somewhat impatiently, for the outsized returns. Terry Chrisomalis: Biotech for me is enjoyable because of the risk involved, and the ability to track the clinical data. I\\'m interested in understanding the p-values in studies, the response rates, and other measures. In addition, I like to see how the drugs that are developed affect patients\\' lives. In other words, does the newly approved drug improve the quality of life for patients? For me, it\\'s also a little bit of a victory that a drug has finally been developed to treat patients with a disease that keeps them alive. A lot of people get caught up in the trial side aspect and forget that the patients that enroll in these studies are real human beings. The most notable thing for me in biotech is the science. I like to look at new technologies in biotech that are advancing our knowledge of treating a multitude of diseases. Some examples of such items include RNAi technology, CAR-T cells, gene therapy, monoclonal antibodies, bispecific antibodies, adoptive cell therapies, and many other treatments that are utilized.\\n ONeil Trader: The science is incredible. Biotech companies are looking to develop therapies that make people\\'s lives substantially better to cure diseases and address unmet needs. Investors get an incredible amount of data that aren\\'t available in other industries. The product profiles are defined by efficacy and safety and we can make comparisons to competing products. It\\'s a really challenging area (isn\\'t investing hard overall?) but rewards can be great. SA: The broader market has been fairly volatile. Let\\'s say we enter a sustained correction or bear market - how would biotech investing fit into that backdrop? Jonathan Faison: As a higher-risk, high-beta sector, biotech stocks are often punished even more than the rest of the market and thus could suffer substantially in the event of an outsized correction. That said, companies that deliver gamechanging clinical results or bring novel medicines to markets of high unmet need are often rewarded regardless. Additionally, we are in a period where innovation is being rewarded by an increasingly receptive and efficient FDA. At the same time, there are many companies pursuing similar approaches or indications (just look at the explosion in # of CAR-T programs in clinical trials or gene therapy companies targeting the same tiny rare disease indications)- such companies that offer an undifferentiated approach or those with only preclinical assets (often came to market lured by additional funding to be raised) are also likely to yield poor returns. Slingshot Insights: An even greater focus on catalyst driven investing. In a world of contracting valuations, buy and hold is the kiss of death for a biotech investor. Pick the event, execute the strategy and get out. Early Retiree: All sectors offer bargains every once in a while and a difficult market environment will only increase the likelihood of market inefficiencies. Since I\\'ve been accumulating cash for some time now, I am happy if prices come down. Investors who only during corrections remember how uncertain the future is should not invest at all and certainly not in biotech. That said, in the worst moments of the GFC, when financing was basically impossible even for more robust companies, a widely respected and cautious value investor like Seth Klarman accumulated large positions in several biotech stocks which subsequently did quite well. The foundation of value investing is that sometimes you can have your cake and eat it, too, i.e. that there is such a thing as a low-risk, high-reward investment. You just have to find it - which is very, very difficult and requires a lot of hard work.\\n Avisol Capital Partners: I have said this before - a bear market is an opportunity for intelligent biotech investors. Individual small-cap biotech don\\'t face macro headwinds as much as other sectors or megacap biotech. So there\\'s always opportunity that way. The other opportunity in a bear market is that small-cap biotechs run through a system - the regulatory, clinical trial system - and it isn\\'t logical to suppose that a stock that was doing well in its early clinical phase just because of the broad market will now see a huge fall just when it received approval for a potential blockbuster drug just because the broad market has turned bearish. Yes, sometimes, that happens - but opportunity lies in finding those stocks where it doesn\\'t. Jérôme Verony: I would say that biotechs with a strong cash position and a long cash runway would fare well. A great example is Denali Therapeutics (DNLI), which has at least a 3-4 year cash runway at present and which has been outperforming the indexes. High-risk and low-cash biotechs would suffer most under a prolonged correction/in a bear market. BioSci Capital Partners: The current bear market commenced with the correction of bioscience stocks, which then spread into the broader market: negative market sentiment can be quite contagious. In this bear market, we believe that the bioscience sector will experience the most drastic correction going into 2019. Because biotech will most likely lose substantial value, it\\'s quite likely that they are positioned to rebound the most at the subsequent bull market cycle. Wall Street Titan: Biotech won\\'t do well in a sustained market decline as it is a high-beta sector. You know what they say about a rising tide? It\\'s the same in reverse. Of course, within the sector, there will still be some spectacular winners and catastrophic losers. Terry Chrisomalis: This goes back to the other question alluded to above about whether to buy and hold or to trade. In a bear market, I would impose the same strategy as I alluded to before. That is to hold some long core positions and maybe average down, because the biotech in question has a large pipeline. If you have confidence, then averaging down may not be a bad thing. Especially, if the biotech has already generated positive clinical data that exudes more confidence as an investment. Then you will have some swing shares that you buy and sell on the same day. The main component for biotech goes back to the fact that it trades based on successful results. Even if there is a bear market, if a phase 3 study is successful in meeting the primary endpoint, then the stock will gap much higher. It is best to implement a strategy and stick with it.\\n ONeil Trader: I am heavily overweight biotech stocks for quite some time and especially now considering the macro uncertainty. I believe my portfolio is as uncorrelated as it can get with the macro environment. And I am not saying that in a way that I think my portfolio won\\'t drop when the market drops. It probably will. I am saying that value will be created fundamentally (through positive clinical trial results, drug approvals and similar catalysts), while it may be destroyed in other industries challenged by worsening macro conditions, and that once the weight of the market is lifted, my portfolio will gain more because of the fundamental value created during the correction or a bear market. It is also possible that there will be positive catalysts that boost my portfolio\\'s performance during periods of negative market performance. The other side of that is, of course, that my portfolio underperforms on a negative catalyst, but both can happen during bull markets and rallies and is not isolated to biotech industry in particular. SA: What are you preparing for in 2019? Any big themes to watch out for? Jonathan Faison: One area that\\'s particularly attractive to me is companies with mid- or late-stage assets targeting indications of high unmet need which have important clinical or regulatory catalysts in 2019 (i.e., phase 3 readout or PDUFA date). Quite a few have significant downside cushion or elements of derisking via promising data generated thus far and valuations have come back down as a result of recent volatility. Additionally, as such assets appear unique with no or few alternatives while targeting large market opportunities, it wouldn\\'t be unexpected for a few to be acquired by larger pharma concerns. Slingshot Insights: We\\'re looking for valuations to bottom out and some attractive assets to be repriced in a way that makes them interesting. We think 2019 will be a year of a lot of names shaking out and early IPO companies (little to no clinical data) seeing severe valuation crunches.\\n Early Retiree: Contrary to many investors, I don\\'t think that the trade war with China is actually that important. It is a show artificially created by Donald Trump and he can and will stop it sooner or later and certainly if it becomes dangerous. I also don\\'t think Brexit will be that important since I believe that the UK will inevitably keep very close ties with the EU anyway. But I do believe that the EU will make (and will have to make) a decisive move in 2019: either towards more unity or towards greater disaggregation and an even more acute impossibility to reform itself. This move will have an important impact on financial markets and maybe the current correction partly anticipates the related risks. The EU will vote for a new parliament in 2019 and unpredictable anti-establishment movements will likely do very well in several key countries like France, Italy and even Germany. How this will play out is anyone\\'s guess. While the EU is certainly the very cause of some of the mess it currently finds itself in, thanks to its united efforts, it has also managed to muddle through and control that mess. With an even less united EU, it could suddenly explode. Avisol Capital Partners: I am looking to see developments in NASH, gene editing, CAR-T. On the risk side, I am closely watching the fate of Obamacare. Jérôme Verony: I am an asset-specific investor above all else. I look for exceptional and/or undervalued molecules and platforms. As such, I look for intrinsic value rather than stocks that are driven by investor sentiment. One \"theme\" that a lot of biotech investors are currently yearning for is a resurgence in M&A activity. After a lackluster 2018, many expect a more fruitful 2019. However, the marked acceleration in share buyback programs across blue chip stocks, which includes big pharma and big biotech, gives me pause - it suggests that cash-rich businesses are very inward looking at present. Another theme to watch out for with Democrats in charge of the House, and the President being receptive to proposals to lower drug pricing, is policy. Senator Warren just proposed that the government manufacture generic drugs under certain conditions. It\\'s an alluring proposition which is already garnering support from health economists. If implemented, it would provide the government with something it hasn\\'t dabbled in before - drug manufacturing capabilities and know-how.\\n BioSci Capital Partners: We\\'ve prepared a list of our five stars stocks. Companies that made this list are those that we believe will enjoy the most robust share price appreciation at the subsequent bull market cycle. These are bioscience companies having the strong balance sheet, excellent assets in development, large addressable market, good market penetration, and stellar management. One big theme for 2019 would be the extensive clinical advancement of immune checkpoint inhibitors with various flagship molecule like cabozantinib of Exelixis (NASDAQ:EXEL) or NKTR-214 of Nektar Therapeutics (NASDAQ:NKTR). These companies are investigating their potential applications in a vast number of cancer indications. Another big theme will be the advancement of various molecules to potentially treat nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (\"NASH\") which is a $25B market without an approved medicine. Wall Street Titan: I\\'ll be watching out to see how the CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing companies progress in their pipeline. This is the cutting edge (some might say bleeding) of medicine, and while the upside is enormous, it is fraught with the possibility of setbacks. Editing the human genome still seems like science fiction to many. Who would have thought it was even possible, just a decade ago. Clover Biotech Research: The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) prides itself in approving more drugs than ever before. We should see the same theme carry into 2019. There are three companies/stocks that I believe will actually benefit from FDA-approval in the new year: Global Blood Therapeutics (GBT), Fennec Pharmaceuticals (FENC), and Zogenix (ZGNX). All of these companies are developing a therapeutic for an orphan condition with limited treatment options. Unlike Synergy and Achaogen, all three should benefit from swift market uptake and big pharma interest. Terry Chrisomalis: I\\'m preparing to see how the stock market starts off in 2019. I wouldn\\'t go crazy and start buying every biotech that I would like. The reason for this is because it important to first track if all the negative instances in 2018 have gone away. For example, big pharmaceutical companies are going to raise prices in early 2019. If politicians come after these companies, then expect the biotech sector to be hit really hard. Another item to watch for which is important would be FDA approvals, in terms of how many come about. At least in 2018 there was a higher-than-expected amount of FDA approvals, hopefully the trend can be continued in 2019. Other than some of these trends, the most important will be the Fed itself in terms of rate hikes. That\\'s because if 2018 taught me anything, it was that the Fed has massive power to cause a bear market. The Fed recently announced that it expects two rate hike increases in 2019. These may end up being deterrents again for the stock market. In turn, that could cause another bear market for all stocks including biotechs.\\n ONeil Trader: I am preparing, as I always am, to optimize my portfolio, to get rid of stocks that are not executing and continue to search for new promising portfolio candidates. I don\\'t see a specific investing theme, but drug pricing may be an overall theme of the year considering the Democrats\\' takeover of Congress and drug pricing topping their agenda. However, I do not believe anything meaningful gets done with a split government, and if something gets done through bipartisan efforts, the vast majority of initiatives that I\\'ve seen to date are unlikely to have a big fundamental impact on drug companies\\' revenues and profits, or at least those I am focusing on. Return of biotech M&A is another potential theme (though I wouldn\\'t really count on it when making investing decisions, in 2019 or ever). I believe big biotech/pharma companies are starving for growth assets, and there are some attractive assets to purchase in the small and mid-cap space. SA: What is one of your best ideas for 2019, and what is the story? Early Retiree: Besides several great non-biotech ideas we are covering in Stability & Opportunity, there is one no-brainer in biotech that comes to my mind. Protagonist (PTGX) is trading for $160 million with net cash of about $130 million, so, first of all, we are getting its pipeline almost for free. This includes three drugs, and two of these are phase-2-ready: A phase 2 drug in ß-thalassemia with a $1-2B total addressable market, a phase 1, oral, gut-selective α4ß7-integrin antagonist in UC with blockbuster potential, plus a development partnership with Janssen (which is also a major shareholder) potentially worth $1B of \"biobucks\" for another potential blockbuster in Crohn\\'s disease, which has just successfully completed phase 1. Few investors know that prior to its IPO Protagonist had actually received partnership bids for the α4ß7-integrin antagonist program, where the upfront payment was higher than its current market cap. This is due to the fact that α4ß7-integrin blockers are considered the safest approach in IBD. There is only one injectable drug (Entyvio, a blockbuster) and no competition for Protagonist\\'s potential oral drug. However, given the highly attractive prospects of this program, the company decided to enter only the Janssen partnership and develop the α4ß7-integrin antagonist on its own. The story is obviously much more complicated, but this short overview already gives you an idea of how unjustifiably cheap the company is, when the market attributes close to zero value to its pipeline. Perceptive Advisors and BVF have recently acquired large stakes.\\n Avisol Capital Partners: Amarin (AMRN). The story is REDUCE-IT data, the immense potential of Vascepa in the CV market. I have discussed this at length. The risk is the question raised around the trial design, specifically the use of mineral oil and its effect on the results. If this risk is mitigated - as I am hoping it will - then, once Vascepa gets approved for the expanded label sometime in 2019, I think we should see a fairly decent spike from these subdued levels. Jérôme Verony: I\\'ll stick with a carry-over from last year\\'s roundtable: ganaxolone, a synthetic neurosteroid developed by Marinus Pharmaceuticals (MRNS), is a seriously undervalued CNS asset. The company just posted positive data from a placebo-controlled dose escalation study in post-partum depression, a 400k patient/year opportunity. Additionally, the company is evaluating the molecule in 2 orphan drug indications: a PhIII trial is ongoing in children with CDKL5 deficiency disorder and a PhII trial is ongoing in refractory status epilepticus. The company also appears poised to move forward with a PhIII trial in children who suffer from epilepsy due to PCDH19 mutations. In 2019, we will have preliminary results from the ongoing PhII trial in RSE as well as definite dosing for the IV to oral switch in PPD. I also expect partnership activity around one of these programs, or an outright acquisition of the company, to materialize in the coming year. BioSci Capital Partners: Our best idea for 2019 is Regenxbio (NASDAQ:RGNX). The company is powering by the next generation AAV gene delivery technology coined NAV. The aforementioned vector leverages on the previous setback of AVV to deliver what has been excellent clinical outcomes. It\\'s quite promising that over 12 different companies are employing NAV to innovate gene therapies for +20 different indications. We believe that many of these trials will procure excellent results. As more positive data rolls in, companies that are using NAV will be excellent acquisition targets. A prime example is AveXis that was bought out by Novartis (NYSE:NVS) for $8.4B back on April 2018.\\n Wall Street Titan: As SA readers know, I have covered Athersys for a number of years and still awaiting for a big pay day. I\\'m still excited by its MultiStem cell therapy program for stroke and would refer readers to the many articles I have written about the company. More recently, I added an early stage biotech to my holdings called AgeX Therapeutics (AGE). AgeX is a recent spinoff from BioTime (BTX) with cutting-edge biotech technologies called PureStem® and induced Tissue Regeneration (iTR™). The company hopes to use these platforms to develop innovative medicines designed to address some of the largest unsolved problems in aging. Prior to the November 28th spinoff, AgeX received an independent validation of its technology through the purchase of 14.4 million shares at $3.00 per by Juvenescence Limited, a life science and biotech company developing therapies to increase healthy human longevity. These shares were sold by BioTime in a private transaction. With AGE shares dropping below this $3.00 arm\\'s length valuation benchmark due to the market selloff, I believe it represents an interesting opportunity. AgeX is a very early stage company, but I think it could become a story stock, at some point, with all the aging baby boomer investors out there as a prime audience. Of the 35,830,000 shares outstanding, 45.8% and 4.8% are owned by Juvenescence Limited and BioTime, respectively, so the low float could make this an interesting play with the right set of circumstances. As with any early-stage preclinical biotech, it is risky. I would refer interested readers to page 82 of this AgeX information statement for a deep dive into the science of aging, a topic that should be very interesting to all. Clover Biotech Research: Minerva Neurosciences (NERV) will have a few readouts in 2019 that are worth paying close attention to. Such indications include insomnia, depression, and schizophrenia. The latter is the most interesting to me because there are no FDA-approved treatments for the negative symptoms associated with schizophrenia. Minerva\\'s under-the-radar drug is in a position to change the treatment landscape for schizophrenia with a phase 3 readout pegged for later next year. Robust phase 2 data and a phase 3 trial designed to repeat the former\\'s success should bode well for Minerva\\'s valuation.\\n Terry Chrisomalis: My best idea for 2019 is CytoDyn (OTCQB:CYDY), because it is gearing up for an important 2019. First, it expects to file a BLA for approval of its Pro-140 combination HIV therapy in Q1 of 2019. From there, it expects to expand its label to use Pro-140 as a monotherapy. This biotech has even started to expand to other diseases using Pro-140, which is a monoclonal antibody. Other target indications include: Graft-versus-host-disease, prostate cancer, triple-negative breast cancer, and many others. In essence I like this biotech because Pro-140 is adaptable and can be used to target many diseases. I like the story because the drug works in treating HIV both as a combination therapy and monotherapy which are large markets. Like many biotech stocks there are many risks here. The first is that it trades on the OTC stock market, that means the stock is highly volatile. In addition, if CytoDyn eventually chooses to uplist to the NASDAQ or NYSE, there will likely have to be a reverse split. The final risk involves whether or not the entire BLA package can be submitted on time in Q1 of 2019. The company is low on cash, and it may need to seek a partner to get things funded. However, there is one thing that can\\'t be disputed much. Pro-140 actually has proven itself in a phase 3 study in treating HIV patients. If it does obtain BLA approval, patients will be able to treat themselves once a week at home with a subcutaneous injection of Pro-140. The combination treatment of Pro-140 is $1.2 billion, with the monotherapy expansion label of Pro-140 bringing the market potential to $3.8 billion. ONeil Trader: I have quite a few stocks I like for 2019, but am singling out what I believe to be the safest of them and with catalysts - Supernus (SUPN). The stock is trading at depressed levels despite the company not making bad moves or reporting negative clinical trial results. The company\\'s two products, Trokendi and Oxtellar, have delivered solid sales growth. Oxtellar\\'s label was recently expanded to include epilepsy monotherapy (it was only approved as adjunct therapy until early December), which should expand its market considerably and the company reported positive phase 3 results of SPN-812 in children and adolescents with ADHD (though the market was disappointed with the lack of upside on the efficacy side to an already marketed competing product). At current levels (the stock is trading in the low 30s as I write this), I believe the stock is undervalued based on its approved product portfolio alone. SPN-812 only adds to the stock\\'s upside potential at these levels, and so does SPN-810 and the company has a robust balance sheet, and it is likely to use it to expand its pipeline in the following quarters. SPN-810 itself could be a major catalyst for the stock in 2019 - phase 3 trial results in impulsive aggression in ADHD are due in mid-2019. And the beauty of this catalyst, at least for me, is that Supernus will be fine and still have more than decent upside if SPN-810 fails, and the upside is considerable if the trial is a success. So, it\\'s essentially a binary event for SPN-810, but I firmly believe not a single dollar is assigned to the success of this asset. There is more to the story than this, but these are the most important things to focus on in 2019.\\n *** Thanks to our guests for running these biotech questions through their labs.

All the Asia-Pacific equity markets advanced today but Japan, where the strength of the yen saw the Nikkei and Topix buck the move. European equities; the 1.4% rally in the Dow Jones Stoxx 600 near midday in Europe retraces 2/3 of this holiday-shortened week's decline. Benchmark 10-year bond yields are little changed. The rally in US shares late yesterday was not enough to lift the 10-year yield back above 2.80%, and Australia, New Zealand, and Japanese yields eased. The 10-year JGB yield slipped into negative territory for the first time since September 2017. European yields are mostly a little firmer, with Italian and UK bond yields dipping slightly. The dollar is lower against most major and emerging market currencies. The dollar-bloc currencies and sterling are consolidating, while the euro, scandis, and yen are extending yesterday's gains. Oil prices are firmer, recouping half-to-two-thirds of yesterday's drop. US shares are trading higher, and the S&P 500 is up almost 0.5%. Asia-Pacific Japan reported a slew of economic data. Most of it was soft, but after contracting in Q3, the world's third-largest economy likely expanded here in Q4. Industrial output fell 1.1% in November, but after the 2.9% gain in October, economists had forecast a sharper decline. The unemployment rate unexpectedly ticked up to 2.5% from 2.4%, though the jobs-to-applicants ratio also rose (1.63 from 1.62). The most disappointing news came from retail sales, which fell 1.0% after a 1.3% (initially 1.2%) rise in October. However, economists had expected retail sales to have held up better and expected only a 0.4% decline. The MOF's weekly portfolio report featured heavy foreign selling of Japanese bonds last week. The JPY2.2 trillion sold liquidates about 2/3 of what was bought in the previous two weeks and is the most since the end of September. It is not unusual for there to be large swings around the fiscal and calendar turns.\\n South Korea also reported a drop in November industrial output. The 1.7% drop (Bloomberg median forecast -0.2%) offset in full the 1.3% (initially 1.0%) gain in October. A decline was seen in memory chips and smartphone output. Investment in facilities and construction also weakened. On Christmas Day, the dollar reached JPY110.00 in Asia, a four-month low. It bounced to JPY111.40 the next day as US stocks rallied strongly. Yesterday's late recovery in US stocks failed to lift the greenback against the yen, though it closed near JPY111.00. It was sold off again in Asia, which is consistent with the idea that Japanese institutional investors are raising hedge ratios. It is pinned near its trough in the European morning near JPY110.30. There is a nearly $450 mln option expiring today struck at JPY110.00. The spike low in late August saw the dollar test JPY109.80. The Australian dollar made a marginal new low for the year yesterday a little below $0.7020. It was not confirmed by the technical indicators, leaving a bullish divergence in its wake. A move above $0.7080 is needed to confirm a low has been forged. Europe The drop in oil prices will cut headline inflation measures. Spain and Germany report preliminary December readings. On the EU-harmonized basis, Spanish CPI eased 0.5%, and the year-over-year pace fell to 1.2% from 1.7%. Several German states have reported and most reported sharp declines in the year-over-year pace. Five states have reported. The year-over-year pace was all north of 2.0% in October, now only one (Bavaria) is above 2.0% (2.2% vs. 2.7%). Baden-Wuerttemberg is at 2.0% (from 2.7%). The risk is that the national figure due later today comes in softer than the 1.9% that the Bloomberg survey median forecast. There have not been additional developments on Brexit to note. Prime Minister May appears to be successfully blocking efforts to provide an alternative to the negotiated deal and a Brexit with no agreement. The way the controversial Withdrawal Bill may pass, the reasoning goes, is if there is no choice but a chaotic departure or the May/EU plan. A serious game of brinkmanship appears to be unfolding.\\n The euro is approaching last week's highs seen near $1.1485. The intraday technicals warn of additional gains in North America today. The 610 mln euro option struck at $1.1450 is still in play. The euro has not traded above $1.15 since October 22. In this holiday-shortened week, volatile markets cannot be ruled out. Above there, the next technical inflection point is seen closer to $1.1550. Sterling is uninspiring and going nowhere quickly. A break of $1.2680 could support a move toward $1.2720, but there seem to be better ways to express a view than playing cable. The euro remains firm against sterling and appears poised to challenge the GBP0.9070-90 peak from earlier this month. North America Many observers are suspicious of the V-shaped bottom in the S&P 500 and recognize that such strong bounces often are associated with bear markets. Still, a move above 2,500 is seen as constructive, and a move above 2,600 would help lift the tone. With parts of the government still closed, official economic data will be sporadic at best. Today private sector data is on tap in the form of the Chicago PMI and pending home sales. The Chicago PMI is likely to drop, but recall what has happened. It surged to 66.4 in November from 58.4 in October. Some pullback seems almost inevitable. It has averaged 61.7 over the past three months and 62.2 this year. Lower interest rates may see pending home sales pick up. The US dollar continues to trade in narrow ranges near CAD1.36. It reached a new high for the year yesterday near CAD1.3660. Initial support now is seen near CAD1.3580. The dollar was sold through the shelf yesterday near MXN19.80, apparently mostly on sentiment. The leveraged community is thought to be long peso through the options market and in holding cetes. The next important chart point is near MXN19.50. Mexico reports its November trade balance today, and a small surplus is expected.\\nDisclosure: I/we have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

The silver price has begun to confirm gold’s rally, which is always a welcome sign from a bull’s perspective. Gold and silver mining stocks are also showing signs of perking up. In this report, we’ll discuss the favorable developments taking place right now and how they bode well for gold’s intermediate-term (3-6 month) outlook. After spending the past several weeks locked in a tight, narrow range, the silver price has begun making headway in its attempt to join gold in reversing the damage inflicted this summer to the precious metals complex. In the last two trading sessions, the iShares Silver Trust ETF (SLV) - my favorite silver proxy - has broken above the ceiling of its 4½ month trading range. By closing decisively above the $14.00 level (see chart below), SLV has signaled that the white metal’s prospects have drastically improved. This implies, moreover, that the lateral trading action in silver price since September most likely represented accumulation, or buying, on the part of informed investors. \\n\\n (Source: BigCharts) The latest rally in silver also confirms the recent rally in gold price. As long-time readers of this report are aware, I consider it to be imperative that the silver price trend more or less in line with the gold price. Otherwise, if the two metals are diverging from one another, the odds are high that a gold price rally will quickly reverse.\\n In recent weeks, however, gold has had enough support from its “fear factor” to move higher without participation from silver. Investors have been on high alert over the suddenly tighter Fed monetary policy, as the Fed funds rate is rapidly getting closer to the yield on the 10-year Treasury bond. This fear, along with continued concerns over the U.S.-China trade war and softness in the emerging markets, has drastically increased gold’s desirability as a safety asset since October. Shown here is my favorite trading vehicle for gold, the iShares Gold Trust ETF (IAU). IAU has clearly established a stair-stepping series of higher highs and lows since bottoming in August. This confirms that gold is in the midst of an intermediate-term turnaround process which is gradually gaining traction and forward momentum. The fact that silver is now showing strength is a plus for gold, since this implies that commodity investors are looking for other assets related to gold which can benefit from a softer dollar. \\n\\n (Source: BigCharts) The recent weakness in the U.S. dollar index is one major reason behind silver’s latest rally. Shown here is the Invesco DB USD Bullish ETF (UUP), which is a useful proxy for the dollar index. As I’ve emphasized in recent reports, as long as UUP remains under its 50-day moving average on a weekly closing basis, the interim trend favors higher precious metals prices, especially for gold. Continued weakness in the dollar will further ensure gains for both gold and silver, although a declining dollar index isn’t necessary for this. The important thing is that the dollar index isn’t trending higher, for when it is, it severely erodes gold’s currently component. \\n\\n\\n (Source: BigCharts) Meanwhile on the mining stock front, the PHLX Gold/Silver Index (XAU) is showing signs of also being under accumulation these past few months. The daily graph shown below is quite similar in appearance to the silver ETF. The XAU has established an immediate-term uptrend, per the rules of my trading discipline, by consistently keeping above its rising 15-day moving average since early December. What’s more, the XAU is also above its widely-watched 50-day moving average. A strong close above the 72.00 level - a key chart resistance - would confirm an interim breakout for the gold/silver index. More importantly, this would provide added confirmation for gold’s rising trend, since participation of the major gold and silver stocks is a sign that both value buyers as well as the speculative element have entered the market. This would tell us that gold is being supported by more than just fear driving its price higher. \\n\\n (Source: BigCharts) The gold rally has certainly helped our trading position in the iShares Gold Trust ETF. I recently recommended that ETF traders take some profit in IAU after it rallied over 5% from the point where it last confirmed an immediate-term buy signal per the rules of my trading discipline in October. The ETF reached a 6-month intraday peak price of $12.26 on December 27 before reversing by day's end. Although this could signal the start of a temporary reversal of the rally which began in October, the most important consideration is that IAU’s price remains above its rising 15-day moving average. This confirms that the fund's immediate-term (1-4 week) trend remains up. The forward progress of the gold ETF is getting some needed support from the (belated) rally in the silver price as mentioned above. Additional participation from the actively traded gold and silver mining shares in the coming days and weeks should also give gold and gold-backed funds the additional reinforcement needed to continue the intermediate-term turnaround which began a few months ago. Further, a transition is apparently underway, in which the leading driver of the turnaround is shifting from fear- to value-driven demand based on the gradual strengthening of gold’s currency component. In light of everything we’ve discussed here, this is the best possible scenario for the metal to continue outshining other assets in the months ahead.\\n On a strategic note, traders should remain long the iShares Gold Trust after recently taking some profit. I recommend raising the stop loss for the remainder of this trading position to slightly under the $11.90 level on an intraday basis. A violation of $11.90 in the IAU would mean that price has fallen under the technically significant 15-day moving average, in turn signaling a shift in the immediate-term trend.\\nDisclosure: I am/we are long IAU.

The company has constantly launched new drinks and products to retain its loyal customers. However, some of SBUX’s initiatives have failed in the recent past, raising questions about its ability to maintain a high growth trajectory. For example, the once popular Starbucks' blended Frappuccino beverages and all its wonderful calories, are no longer popular with customers and t he company’s mobile app has created in-store traffic jams near the pickup areas within stores. In addition, SBUX has reported stagnant store traffic at established U.S. cafes due to intense competition from rivals that include upscale coffee houses, fast-food chains and convenience stores. Same-store sales have declined in all regions since peaking in 2015. In June 2018, SBUX’s stock plunged by over 9% after the company reported that its same-store sales growth for 3Q2018 had increased just 1% - well short of the 3% forecasted growth rate. \\n\\n\\n Source: Y Charts The slowdown of comparable sales growth led many investors to believe that the stock wouldn't rebound – not even with a shot of it's own java. The stock decline renewed fears about SBUX’s growth and the bearish outlook led management to adopt a three-pronged strategy for the shot of caffeine that shareholders were looking for. The strategy comprises three key objectives, penetrating the Chinese market while strengthening its position in the US market, leveraging the Global Coffee Alliance, and streamlining operations. Developing the Chinese market As a part of its first strategic initiative, the company is increasingly focusing on the Chinese market. While it has already established a presence in several key cities the acquisition of full control of their East China joint venture is a clear signal of the company's commitment to the country. It recently paid $1.3 billion for the rest of the JV it didn't already own, taking control of 1,300 cafes with the plan to open another 2000 more stores by 2021. The company is confident about its growth prospects and management feels it has an advantage over competitors because of its first-mover advantage and the fact it has been operating in China since 1999. From a branding point of view, SBUX has not only managed to establish its brand identity in a tea-loving nation but has also succeeded in winning a 58.6% share of the market. During FY 2018, SBUX established 585 new stores and entered 17 new cities. In the 4 th quarter alone, it opened 139 stores and entered five new cities. In addition to establishing its stores in East China, SBUX has now opened 3,500 stores across 148 cities in Mainland China. In addition, the initiatives launched in the fourth quarter have played an important role in differentiating its offerings. The company plans to strengthen and defend its market position by launching new product varieties like the unique ‘Coffee Meets Ice Cream’ platform which is being offered in more than 1,000 stores across China.\\n In Q4, SBUX’s comparable store sales in China increased by 1%, an improvement over the sales growth of -2% even if not spectacular. In fact, when it failed to reach its targeted sales growth in Q3, the company decided to build a successful channel partner program with Alibaba, the Chinese eCommerce company that offers a number of electronic on-demand platforms. Partnership with Alibaba SBUX’s partnership with Alibaba will open up alternative delivery channels and reach a broader Chinese market. The company will be capitalizing on the alliance by selling its products through eCommerce food delivery platforms like Ele.me, Tmall ,Taobao and mobile and online payment platform Alipay. By selling its products through these Alibaba-owned delivery channels, SBUX will also improve the quality and the timeliness of its service delivery. Previously, SBUX had no control over its food delivery channels because it relied on third-party delivery partners. Through its alliance with Alibaba, SBUX can have greater control over delivery channels and it's delivery partner will also adhering to all of SBUX quality and safety standards. SBUX has begun to test the online delivery services in Beijing and Shanghai by using Ele.me online platform. As a part of this service, SBUX’s customers will purchase products online and Ele.me’s registered riders will make sure that the orders are delivered within half an hour. SBUX will also setup physical order fulfilment centers inside Alibaba’s Hema cashless supermarkets in Shanghai and Hangzhou. Currently, SBUX’s online delivery initiative is being tested in only 150 stores but will be expanding to more than 2000 stores. \\n\\n Source: Starbucks Reports Q4 and Full Year Fiscal 2018 Results\\n Growth strategy for the US Market SBUX is optimistic about achieving growth in the domestic US market despite recent lagging performance . The company will be introducing a range of beverages like ‘Nitro Cold Brew’ and ‘Refreshers’. The ‘Nitro Cold Brew’ drink is currently being offered in about 700 stores and it is expected to be served in 2,800 stores by the end of the fiscal year. The popularity of the new product offerings should help SBUX make up for the low demand of its blended beverages. SBUX is also stepping up its efforts to achieve operational excellence within its stores and to pass on the savings to the customer. Through the end of FY 2019, the company plans to reduce in-store administrative tasks by 50%. In Q4, the company cut down one-and-a-half hours of administrative tasks per day – allowing staff to focus on more on value-added activities. The company is also expanding its digital reach and has achieved double-digit growth in active rewards memberships year-over-year. Digitally registered customers grew from 6 million at the end of Q3 to 10 million at the end of Q4. The customers enrolled in the rewards program continue to drive nearly 40% of the business in the U.S. with ‘Mobile Order and Pay’ contributing to 14% of all sales transactions. Lastly, Starbucks’s strategy for the U.S. market is also poised to benefit from its global alliance with Nestlé. The alliance underlines SBUX's efforts to improve its market share in the U.S.. Global Coffee Alliance with Nestlé SBUX’s second strategic initiative is to expand and leverage the Starbucks brand through the Global Coffee Alliance with Nestlé. This initiative is a part of SBUX’s broader strategy to build a robust channel partner ecosystem. For SBUX, the goal is to enhance its product offerings for coffee lovers globally. Through the alliance, the two companies will collaborate with each other to expand in domestic and global markets. Starbucks benefits from Nestle's global operations and distribution network, while Nestle is able to strengthen its competitive position in the North American premium and branded coffee segment.\\n SBUX will leverage Nestlé’s distribution channels for selling its coffee beans and blends through supermarkets and other food stores around the world. This will allow SBUX coffee products to reach restaurants and catering operations across the globe., giving the company a foray into the grocery and foodservice sector. The SBUX business covered by the deal will generate around $2bn in annual sales and it contribute 9% of total SBUX’s revenue. Nestlé is paying Starbucks $7.15bn upfront in cash for the perpetual rights to market. During the Q4 2018 earnings conference call, John Culver, the Group President for channel development, mentioned that the deal with Nestlé is expected to be accretive in FY2020. Streamlining Operations SBUX’s third strategic priority is to streamline its operations and to lower the cost of operations for increasing shareholder returns. Over the past year, the company’s efforts to streamline the company has focused on key areas of retail market alignment and business simplification. The retail market alignment has already been evidenced by the company’s purchase of its East China joint venture as well as its exit from smaller markets where it underperformed. It has sold its Tazo tea brand to Unilever and by closed the Teavana specialty retail stores. In addition, it has transitioned its e-commerce business to channel partners while simplifying its SKU structure. More recently, the company has decided to automate inventory tracking and replenishment systems in its stores. Kevin Johnson, the CEO of Starbucks, has commented that the company’s initiatives to streamline the company operations have freed up capital, which will be utilized to return $25 billion to shareholders through FY2020. About $9 billion has already been returned to shareholders in FY2018 alone. A target for activist investors? SBUX’s three-pronged strategy has proved instrumental in making the company maintain its competitive edge. Analysts who had expressed concerns about SBUX’s falling stock price are now bullish about the stock, particularly after the company delivered better-than-expected sales figures in the domestic market.\\n The stock has bounced back by 8.5% since the Q4 2018 results have been reported. It is also important to note that SBUX’s stock rose by 5% in October 2018 when Bill Ackman, an activist investor and hedge fund manager, revealed that his Pershing Square Capital Management owns 15.2 million shares of the company. The investor’s stake is worth $900 million. Ackman believes that SBUX’s earnings in China will grow from 13% to 17% of the company’s earnings by 2022 and the company has a good opportunity to reinvigorate the U.S. market. Ackman is well-known for his high-pressure tactics to influence the strategies of the companies that he invests in. However, his current position appears to be passive as the investor has been supportive of management’s strategic initiatives. Terming SBUX’s strategic initiatives as ‘encouraging’, Ackman has suggested that the company’s current challenges are manageable with an appropriate business strategy and that the company’s stock price can double if same-store sales improve with valuation reverting to historical levels. How long Ackman will remain silently on the sideline is anyone's guess but just knowing he is 'around' might be the extra incentive management needs to right the ship. The stock is now up 20% in the last three months and now the problem is whether it has spiked too far too fast.  Q4 Results  SBUX reported strong results in Q4 with consolidated net revenues increasing by 11.7% over the previous year. Additionally, the company’s GAAP Earnings Per Share grew by 4% over the previous year and the company has delivered improved sequential results in both Americas and the China / Asia Pacific regions. \\n\\n Source: Starbucks Reports Q4 and Full Year Fiscal 2018 Results\\n It opened 604 net new stores and currently operates 29,324 stores across 78 markets. Meanwhile, $3.6 billion was returned to shareholders through a combination of dividends and share repurchases. \\n\\n Source: Starbucks Reports Q4 and Full Year Fiscal 2018 Results For the full year, 2018, the company’s global comparable store sales increased by 2% and its consolidated net revenues increased by 10% in comparison to the previous year. In 2018, the GAAP earnings per share increase by 64% over the previous year. \\n\\n Source: Starbucks Reports Q4 and Full Year Fiscal 2018 Results For fiscal 2019, SBUX expects to add about 2100 net new stores globally. Additionally, the company expects global comparable store sales growth near the lower end of the 3% to 5% range. It projects that it will achieve consolidated revenue growth of 5% to 7%. This includes a 2% headwind related to streamline-driven activities. Adjusted EPS is expected to increase from 8% to 10% and it will fall in the range from $2.61 to $2.66. Beyond 2020, SBUX will begin to cash in on its strategic alliance with Nestlé in addition to the benefits delivered by its partnership with Alibaba. Patient investors can look to 2020 as a critical year in which SBUX stock could potentially spike. But just looking out 12 months, and using a $2.63 estimate for EPS, we still think the stock has compelling value. If we apply a 3 year average PE multiple of 27.8 to EPS estimates we get a stock price of $73. That's a 20% return when you add in the dividend. \\n After the additional 5% decline in the last week, we believe there is an even more compelling reason to buy. The dividend yield of 2% isn't a screamer but at a payout ratio of 38% there is a good chance there will be a dividend boost - not likely in the next few quarters but certainly in the latter half of 2019. We expect it will probably be higher than the $0.06 boost to the dividend earlier this year. \\n\\nREITs, Opportunities, & Income (ROI)\\nROI is a service provided to help investors like yourself find opportunistic misplaced bets, income growth generating securities, and coverage on small and mid-cap stocks to complement your large-cap weighted portfolio.\\nOur Portfolio Tracker allows you to enter your own positions and track their performance as well as forecast your portfolio balance over the next 100 years using real-life stock and bond returns.\\nWe also share our Focus List, Small and Mid-Cap Growth List, Dividend Growth List, and Premium REIT List.\\nOur universe of coverage is rounded out with the real-life, actively managed Low Vol REIT Portfolio, designed to outperform the MSCI US REIT Index with lower volatility.\\nTry it free for two-weeks with no obligation\\n\\nStart a free trial now.\\nDisclosure: I/we have no positions in any stocks mentioned, but may initiate a long position in SBUX over the next 72 hours.

That has several implications. One of them is that I cover the whole spectrum: from growth stocks to value stocks. But it also means that I pick growth stocks that I think will become value stocks by holding them for very long periods. Over the last year, I have been focusing more on growth stocks, for example, in my ongoing series Potential Multibaggers and Chinese Stocks To Buy Now. But this article is the first part of a new series in which I want to focus on DGI (dividend growth investing) again. For those who don't know, it is an investing philosophy in which you reinvest your dividends to buy more stocks with the dividends that you receive. Those dividends then generate more cash for even more dividend stock purchases, etc. DGI uses the power of compounding. Some of my readers that love growth stocks might think dividend payers are boring and have low returns. And it is true that dividend stocks are often more mature and less volatile. But the combination of a growing dividend, a growing stock price, and holding your stocks for long periods can have great results. You can see that from this illustration: \\n\\n (Source) Also, dividends are often an important means for investors to prepare for the future. A lot of DGI investors use the strategy to prepare for retirement. They prepare to use the dividends and some of the gains to make a bigger retirement allowance.\\n What are value stocks? What value stocks are exactly is not always so clear. There are lots of different definitions out there and therefore I would like to give you my own. For me, value stocks are stocks that pay a growing dividend, are valuated moderately (or even cheaply), and have great prospects, by which I mean that their businesses are not in some industry that I think will decline over the next few decades. That means I stay away from a lot of traditional dividend stocks. I invest with an investing horizon of a few decades. And while I cheer for people that hold on to stocks they have owned for a long time, even if they perform somewhat less good now, I would not advise young investors with a long investing horizon to put money into some of the old economy's household names - the most typical DGI stocks there are. So no Coca-Cola (KO) for me, no Walmart (WMT) or Verizon (VZ). The reason is that that their sales growth is pedestrian at best. Verizon: 1.7% over the past five years; Walmart: 1.30%; and Coca Cola: (-5.90%). They are able to squeeze out growth from reducing costs, but a slow or negative sales growth doesn't bode well for the future, as IBM (NYSE:IBM) has been showing for quite a few years now. Maybe you shake your head now because you are not convinced and think that these three names are the best there are on the market now, but this is the list of the biggest companies in 1994 - 25 years ago: \\n\\n (Source) Some of these, especially from the biggest, have done very bad: General Electric (GE), Ford (F) and General Motors (GM). Not convinced yet? This is the total return of ten dividend kings over the last 25 years compared to the S&P 500. I have picked ten names that are generally seen as high quality and that are household names for DGI investors: Johnson & Johnson (JNJ), Coca-Cola, Verizon, McDonald's (MCD), Procter & Gamble (PG), 3M (MMM), Altria (MO), Emerson (EMR), Walmart and Hormel Foods (HRL). Most DGI investors would consider this as a high-quality portfolio. But, as you can see, they all underperform the S&P 500 over that 25-year period:\\n \\n\\nSPY Total Return Price data by YCharts Now I know that this excludes the dividend reinvestment that DGI adds for the compounding of wealth. And I am confident that some of the stocks would outperform the S&P then, but I am also pretty sure most would still underperform if you would compare the S&P 500 total return with reinvested dividends. I don't mean to disrespect DGI investors. Heck, I consider myself one of them! But with this article and the series that will follow, I want DGI investors to be aware that they can improve their results by not just picking the usual suspects, but looking at other options too. Which dividend stocks to choose then? The dividend stocks I choose are stocks of companies that have a higher dividend growth rate than most more typical names combined with a relatively low payout ratio. A low payout ratio is essential. If you divide the market into five quintiles of highest to lowest dividends, the first quintile (with the highest dividend) has an average of 71% payout ratio, while the second quintile only has an average payout ratio of 41%: \\n\\n (Source) The results of the second quintile are much better than that of the first: \\n\\n\\n (Source) The dividend raisers and initiators outperform all other stock categories, with less volatility: \\n\\n (Source) The fact that there is less volatility for dividend growers and initiators may be a good reason to have some in your portfolio. They might balance out the high volatility of some of the growth stocks that you might have. While the outperformance in percentages may seem futile, in money, the difference looks much more substantial over the long term: \\n\\n (Source) As you can see, $100 grows to $8,267 for dividend growers and initiators, only to $3,055 for the S&P 500, and only to $327 for dividend non-payers. The dividend cutters and eliminators make you lose money even after such a long time of 45 years. The growth comes from the growth This is probably my most unclear (or philosophical?) header so far in my writing career here on Seeking Alpha, but what I mean is that the growth of dividend stocks mostly comes from the dividend growth of that stock. You can see that in this graph: \\n\\n (Source) Now, of course, that graph is worldwide, which is not the same as the US market, but it also holds for American stocks:\\n \\n\\n (Source) So here again the numbers show that it is essential that a company has to be able to grow its dividend substantially. A 1% raise to keep up the streak of dividend growth will not be a substantial benefit for investors. I always strive for at least double-digit growth for years to come. Dividend stocks: especially now! While growth stocks have been very fashionable over the last years, outperforming most dividend stocks, you see that dividend stocks have gone out of fashion for individual investors, while institutional investors have bought more of them. \\n\\n (Source) The recent market volatility may be an excellent reason and time to add a few dividend stocks to your portfolio. A dividend stock can soften the high volatility we have been seeing over the last few months. For a lot of investors, it makes the waiting for price appreciation much easier because they feel they are paid to wait. Conclusion This article is a sort of touchstone for dividend investing the way I see it. Investors should look at more than just the yield or the streak that dividend kings have: payout ratio and especially dividend growth are much more important to outperform. Since more and more institutions are buying dividend stocks, this might be an indicator that dividend stocks are set to outperform again over the course of the next few years. In the articles that follow, I will provide the reader with an analysis of what I see as some of the best dividend stocks to hold for the long term.\\n In the meantime: keep growing!\\nDisclosure: I/we have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours. I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions. I am not receiving compensation for it (other than from Seeking Alpha).

Leading the way was Disney (NYSE:DIS), and if you thought the House of Mouse had a stellar frame this year, just wait until 2019. Here are the three things investors need to know about why Disney could be on pace to exceed expectations in the new year. The Most Stacked Box Office Slate of Any Studio Disney’s 2019 success is going to come from three key areas - movies, streaming and theme parks - but it is the movie side that fuels the entire company. While most studios would be happy to have a tentpole per quarter, Disney is going to have multiple with at least 9 major releases on the calendar. In 2018, Disney led the box office largely courtesy of Avengers: Infinity War, which has amassed a staggering $2+ billion worldwide, including $675+ million in the US alone. To put that into perspective, overall the company had 10 major films release in the last 12 months, and in total that netted $3 billion stateside.\\n So yes, Disney had a good year. However, it also had a few uncharacteristically high-tier flops, led by Solo: A Star Wars Story, which many attributed to oversaturation of the Star Wars brand. The movie, which was plagued with problems during production, came just months after the boffo success of The Last Jedi, and many felt it was too much, too soon. Add in A Wrinkle In Time and The Nutcracker and The Four Realms, both of which needed international help to make back their production budgets, and you can see where the Mouse team took a few unnecessary risks; however, when you have The Avengers franchise in the same year, you can afford the gamble. Although, make no mistake, the Solo miss was big, because it showed the company's prized brand could be vulnerable. The difference is that Disney can, and likely did, learn from the mistake. It’s really more a situation where the idea was solid but the execution was not. With Disney that doesn’t happen often, so it is even more glaring when it does occur. 2019 doesn’t look to have that many spots that look to be problematic this early on, and investors are likely to see hit after hit roll out starting in March and running right through to the end of the year. In fact, Disney is coming in hot with the highly anticipated Captain Marvel (featuring the franchise’s first female centered on a female superhero) and then going shortly after into Avengers: Endgame. Sandwiched in between those is the first of three live-action remakes of iconic Disney films, with Dumbo flying in first and Aladdin and The Lion King taking summer slots. Now, for most studios that would be enough, but this is Disney, and that also means both Star Wars and Pixar, each of which are bringing titans to play as Toy Story 4 and the untitled Episode 9 are on the calendar. And I didn’t even mention Frozen 2. Making A Splash In Streaming Disney’s relationship with cord-cutters in 2018 was a trouble spot, as the company ended its relationship with Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) to bring future films onto its own upcoming service, Disney+. Around the same time (and in a move that Netflix will swear is unrelated), Netflix cancelled the majority of its Marvel live-action titles, including Daredevil, Luke Cage and Iron Fist - it effectively also cancelled the always up-in-the-air Defenders 2.\\n Now Disney could bring all these shows onto its service, but Disney+ is likely going to be exclusively PG-13, and so, it was conceivable both could work independent of the other, but that was not to be. Making things more complicated was a report had also surfaced Daredevil was supposedly Netflix’s fourth most-watched series, weakening the case that its cancellation was a result of low viewership. Still, the point is Netflix lost a sizable amount of content that Disney will make available in 2019 and beyond. Yet, beyond the name we really don’t know a ton about what Disney is planning on doing with the service. While I suspect we will hear more very soon - as in the coming weeks (remember, the Consumer Electronics Show is fast approaching) - there is a lot we can assume just from the sheer number of titles under the company’s control. Investors are also watching Disney+ for a different reason - between the Big 3 (Netflix, Hulu and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN)) and a variety of more niche services, the streaming space is already crowded, and in 2019, it’s going to be complete gridlock. In addition to Disney, WarnerMedia (NYSE:T) and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) are going to make their grand debuts, and that is going to have a domino effect industry-wide. Until now it was possible to have all of the major services for what is really the price of a buying a single Blu-Ray or two a month, but now it's going to get more crowded and costlier for consumers, and something’s going to have to give - but the smart money is on Disney coming out ahead. An “Edge” In Theme Parks And that brings us to the third aspect of Disney’s 2019 plans: theme parks. It is here where the company is laying down the biggest play across the board. No seriously, in terms of sheer size, this is the largest move of any of its rivals. The Star Wars land named Galaxy’s Edge will spread out across 14 acres of both of Disney’s main theme US-based theme parks: Disneyland and Disney World. Featuring an immersive experience that is fully canon (i.e., part of official Star Wars lore), this is not just a theme park - it’s the next generation of attractions.\\n From the moment guests step onto the property, they became characters in a large-scale story that lets them craft their own journey in a world forged by Luke Skywalker, Darth Vader and company. Featuring brand new technology and ride systems, this will test the limits of capacity for both parks. With the same level of detail being applied that made Universal’s Harry Potter and Animal Kingdom’s Avatar world come to life, it is no exaggeration to say nothing is being taken for granted here, and it's safe to buy into the hype. Now, I know one could read this piece as a giant love letter to Disney, and I can see why you think that, but the truth is Disney has positioned itself to have one of the most record-breaking years of any company in its class. This is its “Avengers” moment, where all the pieces are falling into place. Personally, I think the company could have spread some of this out over the next year or two, especially when it comes to its motion picture roster - but then you look at what’s on the slate for 2020 and 2021 and you see Disney is fairly set. It really is an embarrassment of riches, and with the acquisition of 20th Century Fox and its TV arm, including ABC, ESPN and Freeform, this is a complete company with one of the industry’s most respected leaders at the helm. Even with Bob Iger saying he plans to step down soon, he’s put Disney on track, where it can be self-sufficient - which is something few other companies can say. Keep in mind, that’s not to say the company won’t have a miss here and there. As mentioned, while I don’t see any glaring holes in this line-up, there is always an element of risk regardless of the strength of its IP. On the film side, I worry about people tiring of big titles as they will come fast and furious. With the streaming service, I worry if the company will be able to launch with the right mix of content, and in the parks, my head goes to the millions and millions of Star Wars fans who are notoriously hard to please and very vocal when upset.\\n Yet, Disney has navigated these problems for decades and has become very swift at plugging holes and assuaging audiences. I’m willing to give the company the benefit of the doubt and buy into the promise, and I think many investors will feel the same way.\\nDisclosure: I/we have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

I'm not sure. What I do know is that shipping valuations are at all-time lows, blowing past even 2008-2009 levels.The last time we saw this level of panic was in Nov15-Feb16, but we're well below those levels. Meanwhile, firms have stronger balance sheets, and market rates are markedly higher.With solid companies at great prices, the near-term trading doesn't matter. Instead, we need to watch fundamentals and ensure there's not a risk of major dilution.We are simply drowning in bargains in this market. This is a luxury problem. No need to take unnecessary risk or invest with sketchy management teams.Instead of picking a 'top idea' for 2019, I'm presenting a list of 12 names. Six with lower risk and six with moonshot potential, but more exposure. All prices/performance officially marked from today's close.\"], 'article': ['Top List Approach: 12 Ideas for 2019 These markets have been extremely brutal, and we are now faced with a situation where virtually every stock in the shipping sector is on sale. I wrote about these markets in a recent public update: \"Something Strange in Shipping.\" Beyond the common equities, preferred stocks are also cheap, and bonds are also dropping a bit. This situation gives us the ability to buy a plethora of attractive names without needing to get picky or stress about a singular top \\'pick\\' or best \\'idea.\\' Sure, not all the names are equal, but the ability to be able to pick a basket of 10 or more names is a rare opportunity even in this volatile sector. Due to the massive discounts, we can afford to be very selective. I\\'m automatically discarding any firms from this list which have sketchy or very weak management teams. This means that several otherwise dirt cheap names, some of which I own and am adding to currently, don\\'t make the cut. Yes, these stocks have enormous potential also, and this is backed by my heavy allocations, but when compiling a top list, one can be more selective. Furthermore, we don\\'t have to buy firms with weak balance sheets or very risky liquidity situations. I understand that some investors want to take a greater degree of market risk (i.e. spot rates or a bit higher leverage) in order to potentially hit multi-bagger returns, but we don\\'t need to take risk needlessly. In this approach, I am providing six names with solid balance sheets and reasonable to low underlying market exposure. I am also providing six names with higher market exposure and a bit more balance sheet risk, but all of these names also offer multi-bagger upside if things go right.\\n Rules of Engagement There are some principle suggestions, call them my personal \\'rules,\\' about these names. Avoid at your peril in these markets.  Never, ever, (ever!) use margin Don\\'t sell naked puts you aren\\'t willing to buy Only buy firms where you like the underlying assets If the price dropping 10% next week would shake you out, move on Keep allocations reasonable, all 12 of these are speculative and risky  Risk/reward seems attractive to me, but major losses are possible  There are more general things to consider, but six rules for two sets of six stocks seems appropriate. If the thesis goes busted on one of these stocks or the market drastically shifts, then it could definitely be time to sell. If the underlying company is doing fine and the stock gets cheaper, that\\'s a good thing, as we can buy more for less. Investing, Speculating, and Gambling Yes, the goal is to make money, and the faster the better, but remember we\\'re here to invest in companies and assets, not to roll the dice on random horses. \\n\\n Image Credit: Wikipedia Likewise, there are some leverage-on-leverage ideas, some of which I employ myself, such as buying otm call options. There are also super-levered moonshot names which might come across our screens later this year. Just keep in mind that\\'s like this. Yeah, we might think the odds are skewed (and sometimes they are), but at the end of the day, there\\'s still a lot of luck involved. Avoid margin! \\n\\n\\n Imagine Credit: Wichita Eagle Furthermore, if you\\'re trying to buy a random stock for something like earnings or some random shift like oil prices, that\\'s a casino play. Those can be fun, those can be lucrative, but they sure aren\\'t investments! Not really a big deal at a small enough allocation and without margin, but be careful! \\n\\n Image Credit: Gambling Sites If you get the urge to gamble and take unnecessary risks. Do yourself a favor, book a flight to Las Vegas, bring some loose change, and hit the tables or slots. You\\'ll have about a 45% chance to make money and a 99% chance of having fun if you have the right mindset. Great food, good shows, and you\\'ll help stimulate the economy as a thoughtful bonus! \\n\\nImage Credit: Vine Pair Major Threats: Trade War/Market-Induced Recession There are two primary threats as we enter 2019, the first, and most obvious to shipping is the escalation of the US-China trade war. I covered this pretty heavily in our 11 December market update. Recommend a review of that. The second threat is a sort of market-induced recession (whether or not the Fed is a causal factor is a topic for lively debate). Obviously, a global recession is bad for shipping. Emerging markets have been showing considerable stress for the past year, and China\\'s growth has markedly slowed. The US economy has been very strong, but growth forecasts have recently came down a bit, and hiring has slowed. There are serious concerns that the recent hike by the Federal Reserve could prove to be too much, and some pundits certainly aren\\'t happy.\\n If either of these headline risks comes \\'true\\' in 2019, I doubt we\\'ll make much money in any of these 12 names. We\\'ll probably lose money. If the holdings are in the first six, it\\'s a lot less likely those losses will be permanent or locked-in (i.e. due to major dilution or other issues), but the second pair of six names are riskier and in the worst case, losses could be permanent. Without further ado, the two lists are below, with brief overviews for each. Investment Candidates: Stable Firms, Sizable Upside All of these firms are still speculative, but they have top-tier foundations and are likely to survive nearly any major market impacts without heavy risk of locked-in capital losses. Gains can still be substantial. Solid management. (Alphabetical Order) Capital Product Partners (CPLP) - $2.10 - Income/Special Spinoff Capital Product Partners offers investors access to one of the largest product tanker companies in the world via upcoming spin-off, Diamond S Shipping (DSSI), which enjoys strong private equity backing and was originally founded with capital from Wilbur Ross. Investors will also retain an income-focused vehicle with strong coverage and a significant payout. I\\'ve discussed the firm in more detail in recent coverage, I believe they are worth well in excess of $4 in a normal market environment. Costamare (CMRE) - $4.38 - Containerships Costamare is one of the largest containership owners and lessors, with clients among most of the top liner firms in the world. They have a very strong backlog with no major credit risks, and management has been steadily eating their \\'own cooking\\' by supporting the stock via a DRIP of their majority shares. If markets normalize, this could be good for a double without much risk. Golar LNG (GLNG) - $22.22 - Full-Cycle LNG Golar LNG is a full-cycle LNG business with enormous growth potential related to the secular shift towards more global LNG transport. They have been making great headway with LNG shipping rates recently hitting fresh all-time highs and their latest growth project, Tortue/Ahmeyim achieved FID last week in partnership with BP (BP) and Kosmos Energy (KOS). Watch video below! If prospects keep rolling forward, this could be a triple digit stock in a few years. Watch video below for their latest project:\\n YouTube video Golar LNG Partners (GMLP) - $10.47 - Income Vehicle Golar LNG Partners is the LP for aforementioned Golar. We know this company well. We loaded the wagons in 2015-2016 at $8, and she was more than a triple-bagger in a year. Even better, we called the stock fully valued in the $20s and then began warning about the distribution levels in early-2018. Sure enough, she fell off a cliff last Spring as management wisely brought the distribution to a more sustainable level. Now, we\\'re long and strong again, and management recently doubled their repurchase from $25M to $50M. Potential upside of over 50%, maybe more, once the market regains sanity. Teekay Corporation (TK) - $3.45 - Diversified Parent Teekay Corporation has been a popular name with us for a while, but she hasn\\'t been a strong performer as the investment timeline gets stretched to the mid/late-2020s, and market chaos has struck hard. I\\'ve recently updated our research here, but I see reasonable fair value in the range of a one year triple as long as they can refinance their January 2020 debt. Debt markets are slammed shut right now, so this one is worth watching more closely. Teekay LNG Partners (TGP) - $11.05 - Long-term LNG Charters The LNG market is hot. Teekay LNG Partners controls one of the largest and most modern fleets in the world and has a contract backlog of almost $11B. They are finalizing a massive newbuild initiative, with the final ships set to be delivered in about 10 months. Once this is complete, the cash flow potential is massive, and the market is sleeping on this one. We estimate free cash flow between $200 and $300M with DCF in the $300s by 2020. Free cash flow yields (2020E) in the 25-30% range? Not a misprint. Prices could double and this name would still be a value. TGP has recently started a $100M repurchase program and has eliminated their pesky K-1 in favor of a 1099. Speculative Ideas: Higher Risk, Moonshot Potential For those who want to chase higher returns, while accepting more market exposure, here is a list of more speculative ideas. All of these names still have good management teams (Genco is the weakest, but they aren\\'t actually toxic), but there is more inherent market risk.\\n (Alphabetical Order) DHT Holdings (DHT) - $4.07 - Crude Tankers (VLCC) DHT Holdings is a VLCC pureplay. They own 27 of these tankers, each of which is capable of transporting 2M barrels of crude oil anywhere across the globe. You sure as heck couldn\\'t tell by the stock price, but current tanker rates have been posting multi-year highs and the last time rates were this strong, DHT was trading in the range of $7-$8/sh with a smaller fleet and a weaker balance sheet. While your less informed neighbors are dumping shares in panic, our analytics show the latest two fixtures of the \"DHT Europe\" at $41.7k/day and the \"DHT Bauhinia\" at $29.8k/day... and those were for middle-aged tonnage! With quarterly averages likely in the strong-$40s, DHT trades for about 2.5x expected free cash flow. We believe they face a strong 2019-2020 as scrubber modernization forces out weaker competitors, and market rates are set to firm. This one isn\\'t without risks as we\\'re talking about tanker day-rates here, but there\\'s also the chance of 50-60-70% gains in short order. Last time the markets turned like this was in late-2014. DHT had a far inferior fleet back then and the stock did over 60% in 6-7 weeks. Could she double in weeks on a Jan-effect this time around? I\\'ve seen much crazier. Dorian LPG (LPG) - $5.75 - LPG Carriers  Dorian has one of the highest quality very large gas carrier (\"VLGC\") fleets in the world. They trade at one-third their tangible value with a clean balance sheet, a good management team, and minimum required capex. This NAV is easily verifiable by recent peer newbuild orders and transactions, meaning that in theory, Dorian could just liquidate entirely tomorrow and we\\'d have more than a double. They sit here in the riskier list because they do have hefty exposure to the spot markets, but one should know the spot markets are the strongest they\\'ve been in years, and there is lots of forward demand growth set for 2019-2020 as Chinese and Indian petroleum gas consumption is primed for growth and US exports are ready to surge.\\n Genco Shipping (GNK) - $7.75 - Dry Bulk Carriers Genco Shipping is a dry bulk carrier company with a rock solid balance sheet which trades underneath 50 cents on the dollar for tangible, real-time market valuations of their assets. They sold a lot of new shares in an oversubscribed and heavily lauded offering last summer at $16.50 and here the stock is, down nearly 55% even as cash flows have been solid. They have covenants that likely block a repurchase until 1 January, but I expect them to announce some initiatives soon thereafter. Do you like to buy dollars for 45-50 cents? I do. International Seaways (INSW) - $16.90 - Crude/Product Tankers International Seaways is a major fan favorite. They were a spin-off from Overseas Shipholding (OSG) and are managed by Lois Zabrocky \"CEO\" and Jeffrey Pribor \"CFO\" with firm American roots and solid corporate governance. I add this factor here for investors who are more wary of the foreign firms as this one is as clean/clear and US-based as they come. They\\'ve been a sort of castaway in the markets, but they have performed to absolute perfection on the fundamentals. First time we bought at $11-$14 post spin-off crash and solid at $22.50 shortly after. Earlier in 2018, I bought in the $15s and sold around $23s. I\\'m gearing up for my third run with this team, and I own their baby bonds (INSW-A) in advance. They are on the riskier half of the spectrum due to their exposure to crude and product tanker markets. The balance sheet is nice though and cash flow is strong. Star Bulk Carriers (SBLK) - $8.83 - Dry Bulk Carriers Star Bulk Carriers owns the world\\'s largest publicly-traded dry bulk fleet, and they are trading at more than a 40% discount to their asset valuations. They recently announced a $50M repurchase program, which they have been providing consistent daily updates on. Their largest hedge fund holder is Oaktree, with around 50% ownership, who recently added more than a million shares in an open-market transaction. I\\'ve covered the firm in recent reports, urging them to repurchase, and I\\'m glad to see they are following through even though their share price has been stagnant. This firm has considerable upside even into moderately disappointing markets, but they do have hefty spot exposure, hence why they are on this riskier list.\\n Teekay Tankers (TNK) - $0.93 - Crude Tankers (Midsize) \"Oh great another Teekay name.\" I know. The name inspires dread in my household, and I\\'m often tired of uttering those two fully spelled out letters in close proximity. That said, when we\\'re making a list of firecracker upside, why not include that one that could be an absolute barn-burner if rates continue? There is a LOT of risk on this one. Financial leverage is high, around 75% debt-to-assets. However, liquidity is strong to at least 2020, TNK trades around 70% of its asset values, and the operating leverage is so extreme that if rates continue at these levels ($40k/day or more for midsize tankers), TNK is sitting at about 0.5x cash flow. Yes - Zero-Point-Five. TNK is drowning is so much cash flow right now that they are generating over 10 cents a month. A penny every 2-3 days. Why aim for the clouds when you can aim for... Mars? If markets stabilize and Teekay is able to continue generating these levels of cash flow, we\\'re talking about 4, 5, or even 6-bagger type returns. Or the markets suck again and she keeps going down. This one is the ultimate chili pepper! Consume in small doses. Coverage Plan & Conclusion This is the official Value Investor\\'s Edge list of top stocks for 2019. These aren\\'t static, but I will be tracking performance metrics from these current prices (close of market 27 December 2018). I\\'ll be providing follow-on public coverage for some of these names and will likely also do quarterly reviews. These are certainly difficult markets but also the kind of situations where enormous gains can be made if risks are controlled. Recent broad market jitters, crashing oil, and of course, the tentative US-China situation hasn\\'t helped the situation. I fully stand by these names above as attractive opportunities in accordance with some of the recommended rules of engagement. I can\\'t promise market outperformance and can only offer my best research and opinions. I welcome a discussion on any of the aforementioned names in the discussion section below.\\n J Mintzmyer collaborates with James Catlin and Michael Boyd on his Marketplace service.\\nContinuing Coverage\\nWe will be covering these top ideas throughout 2019 as part of our public coverage. Members of Value Investor\\'s Edge will receive the first look at new coverage updates and potential changes to our portfolios as the year progresses. Roughly 90-95% of our research is exclusive to our members with the rest released to the public.\\nIn advance of the New Year, we are offering a two-week free trial which also includes access to our high-yield portfolio and exclusive preferred equity and fixed income reviews.

As the sanctions on Iran were approaching in early November, market sentiment in the energy commodity was optimistic and bullish. However, a series of events created what turned out to be an almost perfect bearish storm for crude oil that has taken the price to its lowest level since June 2017. President Donald Trump had been warning the Saudis and allies within OPEC while the price of oil was rising that they needed to increase their output to control the high price of the energy commodity. What seemed an unrelated event at first, turned into a useful pressure point which the U.S. used to gain Saudi cooperation when it came to their production and sales of petroleum. The murder of Jamal Khashoggi was a tragedy, but it became a serendipitous event as the desperate Saudi Royal Family capitulated to U.S. demands and stepped up their production of crude oil. At the same time, the U.S. issued exemptions to eight nations that purchase Iranian crude oil which caused additional selling into the market as those with long positions on the back of sanctions scrambled to exit a falling market. As the stock market began to suffer downdrafts, the price of oil continued to decline. In early December, a production cut by OPEC did little to stabilize the price as it fell below the $50 per barrel level in the aftermath of the cartel’s meeting and decision to cut production by 1.2 million bpd. U.S. shale production continued to rise, and so did inventories of the energy commodity. As U.S. output reached 11.7 million bpd, it became the world’s leading producer. The lower price of oil did not lead to a slowdown in U.S. production, as of Friday, December 21 the number of oil rigs in operation according to Baker Hughes stood at 883, up ten from the previous week and 136 from the same week at the end of 2017.\\n The price of crude oil limped into the week of December 24, and on the day before the holiday, it plunged once again in a scene that is becoming the norm rather than the exception in the oil futures market. Whacked again on Christmas Eve On Friday, December 21, the price of the active month February NYMEX crude oil futures contract settled at the $45.59 level after trading to a low at $45.13 during the session which was the lowest price for the energy commodity since July 2017. Thin market conditions and a plunging stock market on December 24 led to a lower low and steep decline in the price of the energy commodity.\\n\\n Source: CQG As the daily chart highlights, the price of oil experienced a significant move to the downside on Christmas Eve on a much lower than average volume of 626,051 contracts. The price settled at $42.53 and traded to a low at $42.36, just 31 cents above a critical technical level for the energy commodity. The June 2017 low could give way The bull market in crude oil began in February 2016 when the price fell to a bottom at $26.05 per barrel. However, markets rarely move in a straight line, and the market underwent corrective periods on its way to the October 3 peak at $76.90. \\n\\n Source: CQG The weekly chart shows that the leg to the highs began in June 2017 when crude oil corrected to a low at $42.05 per barrel on the nearby NYMEX futures contract. At the time, the price action looked extremely bearish at it had broken below technical support at the November 2016 bottom at $42.20, but oil only made a marginally lower low, and it proceeded to take off to the upside. A few months later it was back above $50 per barrel, and by the end of 2017, it reached the $60 level. In 2018, it conquered the $70 hurdle and remained north of $60 until November. Starting in October, crude oil crashed below $70, $60, $50, and is now threatening the $40 per barrel level. The only thing that stands in front of a move to below $40 could be the technical support at $42.05 dating back to June 2017. On Christmas Eve, the price came dangerously close to that price at a time of the year where seasonal price weakness is the norm.\\n The potential for a $30-handle  With the end of 2018 only days away and oil in a bear market that has taken the price lower by over 44% in just under three months, many market participants are likely sitting on significant losses in the oil market and related equities. The potential for additional selling to clear the decks going into 2019 is high over the coming sessions. The move in the futures market on December 24 on low volume was eye-opening and a sign of what could be in store for the market over the coming days and weeks if the trend since October continues. On December 26, a rally in the stock and oil futures market took prices appreciably higher, but on December 27 the prices of both were on the defensive once again. The only positive factor in the crude oil market at this time is that market sentiment is as bearish today as it was bullish when the energy commodity was on the highs on October 3. Oil equities are plunging Oil equities plunged as the double-barrel impact of a falling knife in both the energy commodity and the stock market have taken the prices of many equities to their lowest prices in many years. On example of just how ugly the sell-off has become is the VanEck Vectors Oil Service EFT product (OIH). The fund summary for OIH states: “The investment seeks to replicate as closely as possible, before fees and expenses, the price and yield performance of the MVIS® US Listed Oil Services 25 Index. The fund normally invests at least 80% of its total assets in securities that comprise the fund's benchmark index. The index includes common stocks and depositary receipts of U.S. exchange-listed companies in the oil services sector. Such companies may include small- and medium-capitalization companies and foreign companies that are listed on a U.S. exchange. The fund is non-diversified.” The most recent top holdings for OIH include: \\n\\n\\n Source: Yahoo Finance The combination of falling stocks and oil have created the most bearish cocktail for oil services companies in years. \\n\\n Source: Barchart At $13.58 per share on December 27, OIH is at its lowest level in decades. It fell to a low of $20.46 in 2016 when NYMEX crude oil hit its low at $26.05. In 2001, then the price of NYMEX crude traded to $16.70 per barrel, OIH was at the $13.94 level, higher than the current price of the ETF. OIH contains some of the top names in oil services and pays a 3.75% dividend. It is more than likely that the carnage in stocks and oil has sent the shares of the companies to price levels that are unsustainable on the downside as we move into 2019. Is the oil market a post-Christmas clearance sale that will yield big rewards in 2019? Over the coming days, shoppers will be lining up to return gifts and take advantage of after Christmas clearance sales. In the oil market, the events of the past three months in stocks and the price of the energy commodity have created some of the most compelling bargains in decades. I believe that the current price level of OIH and some of the other quality products and companies in the oil patch limits their downside potential as we head into 2019. The upside potential for recoveries in these share prices is the best in years. I do not know where the bottom will be in oil or stocks. However, at its current share price which is lower than when the price of crude oil was at under half its current price level is a reason that I am buying OIH on a scale-down basis aggressively. I may have started too soon, but I believe that this ETF will yield significant rewards in 2019.\\nThe Hecht Commodity Report is the most comprehensive commodities reports available today from the top-ranked ranked author in both commodities, forex, and precious metals.

Looking at the ongoing stock market drop, someone asked us if this is \"it\". So far in Q4, the stock market (S&P 500) has now lost more points than in any quarter during the Great Financial Crisis (though so far less as a percentage). Is this it? Will gold hit $10,000? \\n\\n S&P 500 Index, daily - an unseemly slipping on the banana peel [PT] There is certainly something more serious happening than at any time post-2009. We mean, after all this time of falling rates and zero (short-term) rates, the Fed presumes to hike rates. It is trying to head something off, which is not occurring. Commodity prices aren\\'t rising (witness the big drop in oil, again). Consumer prices, especially in some urban markets, may be rising. Taxes, regulations, zoning, permitting, compliance, inspections, user fees, environmental impact studies, labor law, and litigation can push up retail prices. However, they are not a monetary phenomenon. The Fed cannot do anything about them, and should not try. Meanwhile, everyone focuses on the effect of rising rates on the US government. They should instead look to the marginal debtor. The US government is not the marginal debtor. For a good list of candidates, one could start with all the firms that the Bank for International Settlements identified as zombies in 2015. \\n\\n The global share of zombie companies according to the BIS [PT]\\n A zombie is a corporation whose profits are less than interest expense. 2015 is before the Grand Interest Hike Gambit. If they were unable to service their debts even then (without borrowing more), just imagine what the change in 6-month LIBOR from 0.38% to 2.9% has done to them. Just think what it\\'s done to the firms that weren\\'t zombies then at 0.38% but are now at 2.9%. \\n\\n 3-month LIBOR since 2015: from practically nothing (17 basis points) to 2.81% - that does make a difference [PT] And this is not counting the decline in revenue to, e.g., the home builders. At higher rates, people can afford less houses (assuming they want to buy a house when they see the market dropping) and move upstream to manufacturers of building products, furniture, etc. And cars. Ford (NYSE:F) and the others are still advertising 0% financing for 72 months. We wrote this May about the increase in the cost of this subsidy to Ford - $1.4 billion, or 28% of its net profit. Since that article, the cost has risen by more than another quarter billion. Ford still isn\\'t letting off the gas pedal out of fear of the even-greater loss it will suffer from the drop in sales that would cause. Even if the Fed were inclined to reverse itself immediately (which we do not see any signs of), we expect there will be some big bankruptcies and lots of smaller ones. Investors will regret moving out on the risk curve in the reach for yield as many junk bonds default and even the survivors incur big capital losses. The spread between junk and Treasury bonds has widened - it can widen a lot further. \\n\\n\\n US high yield spreads - since breaking out from a sideways channel near multi-year lows, junk bond spreads have soared [PT] But $10,000 gold? Collapse of the dollar? We don\\'t see it in our macroeconomic analysis, and we don\\'t see it in the basis spread. There is no sign of backwardation (in the USD, there is permanent backwardation in the Swiss franc). We would expect to see serious gold backwardation before a banking system or currency crisis. Fundamental Developments Speaking of the gold basis, let\\'s look at the only true picture of the supply and demand fundamentals of gold and silver. But first, here is the chart of the prices of gold and silver. \\n\\n Gold and silver priced in USD as of last week Next, this is a graph of the gold price measured in silver, otherwise known as the gold-to-silver ratio (see here for an explanation of bid and offer prices for the ratio). It rose last week. \\n\\n Gold-silver ratio Here is the gold graph showing gold basis, co-basis and the price of the dollar in terms of gold price. \\n\\n Gold basis, co-basis, and the USD priced in milligrams of gold It is interesting to see a rise in scarcity (i.e., the co-basis) along with fall in the price of the dollar (i.e., rise in the gold price), at least in the February contract. However, it did not occur in the Gold Continuous Basis.\\n The Monetary Metals Gold Fundamental Price rose $19 to $1,307. Now, let\\'s look at silver. \\n\\n Silver basis, co-basis, and the USD priced in grams of silver In silver, we see the same pattern - and less. A small change in price and a small change in scarcity. And unlike in gold, the Monetary Metals Silver Fundamental Price fell 8 cents, to $15.11. © 2018 Monetary Metals Charts by: StockCharts, BIS, St. Louis Fed, Monetary Metals Chart and image captions by PT\\n']}\n",

William Ledward, Robert Nelson, Nicholas Hardingham and Stephanie Ouwendijk of Franklin Templeton Fixed Income Group take a look at emerging-market debt. They say that while EM bonds generally weakened in 2018, valuations now look attractive. Recent Volatility Has Produced a Range of Opportunities in Emerging-Market Debt Emerging-market (EM) bonds generally weakened during 2018, but less so than some other asset classes. However, economic growth in emerging markets has continued to beat developed-market growth. We believe this leaves EM debt well-placed for the coming year. Valuations have improved, and the average EM hard-currency bond yielded more than 6% at October-end.1 Many EM currencies traded down in 2018 and may now be undervalued. By November, for example, the Indonesian rupiah traded at its lowest exchange rate versus the US dollar in over a decade, despite the country\\'s solid economic outlook. Commodity prices, especially the rising price of oil, have bolstered EM debt and will continue to be important in 2019. We don\\'t make long-range commodity forecasts, but some trends are clear. US sanctions on Iran should reduce supply, but China and India will probably continue to buy Iranian oil. US shale proved less influential than expected because of limited US pipeline capacity. And, we expect that Venezuela\\'s output may continue to decline as long as President Nicolás Maduro remains in place.\\n The Main Stumbling Blocks Are Well-Known Liquidity from central banks in developed markets is expected to taper off in 2019, and this should weigh on EM debt. The US Federal Reserve projects three rate hikes in 2019. In that scenario, the federal funds target range would rise to 3.00-3.25%, 100 basis points above its level in November 2018. To counter this effect, we have maintained relatively low exposure to US interest-rate duration. Instead, we focus on credit spreads to seek high yields. Further trade tensions may weigh on EM sentiment, but we expect their direct impact on EM bonds to be limited. The Trump administration will probably continue to focus on China. China\\'s local currency bond market remains small, however, and its hard-currency issuers are mainly banks and infrastructure firms that have little involvement with international trade. Venezuela\\'s sovereign default, which started in 2017, is likely to drag on as long as President Maduro stays in power, and a regional intervention seems unlikely. Turkey\\'s currency crisis looks manageable in 2019, given a stronger policy response, with its government less exposed than the country\\'s corporate sector. Moreover, Turkey\\'s crisis is country-specific - just like the crises in Venezuela and Argentina - and not symptomatic of wider issues across the EM universe. Tracking Individual EM Opportunities Emerging markets are on course to, collectively, remain the world economy\\'s largest segment in 2019. They are, however, far from homogeneous, so we keep a close eye on events in individual countries. In Mexico, incoming President Andrés Manuel López Obrador (\"AMLO\") calmed investors with a market-friendly message before his election but then scrapped plans for a new airport backed by the business community. What kind of president will he turn out to be? And what policies should we expect of Jair Bolsonaro? Brazil\\'s president-elect has promised to reduce government waste but is skeptical of Chinese investors and may try to renegotiate Mercosur, the South American trade agreement.\\n More elections lie ahead in 2019 for Nigeria (February), Indonesia (April), India (April or May), the Philippines (May), South Africa (by August), Argentina, Uruguay and Mozambique (all in October), and Poland (November). But few of these are likely to be as important as the elections that took place in 2018. Indonesia\\'s economy has thrived under President Joko Widodo, and many investors hope that this will help him see off his main rival, former military commander Prabowo Subianto. In South Africa, voters will get their chance to confirm, or condemn, President Cyril Ramaphosa, possibly against the backdrop of a recession. In Argentina, President Mauricio Macri\\'s re-election chances have shrunk since he called upon the International Monetary Fund for assistance, but a fragmented opposition may fail to grab power. We continue to track these situations and adjust our portfolios accordingly. Other than perhaps Lebanon, we see no obvious default candidates among the main sovereign issuers in the year ahead. After a buoyant 2017, investor expectations for EM debt were high at the beginning of the year. However, 2018 injected a much-needed dose of realism. Now, on the cusp of 2019, we believe prices are more attractive than they have been for a while. 1. Source: Bloomberg. Data as of 10/31/18.

Special risks are associated with investing in foreign securities, including risks associated with political and economic developments, trading practices, availability of information, limited markets and currency exchange rate fluctuations and policies. Sovereign debt securities are subject to various risks in addition to those relating to debt securities and foreign securities generally, including, but not limited to, the risk that a governmental entity may be unwilling or unable to pay interest and repay principal on its sovereign debt. Investments in emerging markets, of which frontier markets are a subset, involve heightened risks related to the same factors, in addition to those associated with these markets\\' smaller size, lesser liquidity and lack of established legal, political, business and social frameworks to support securities markets. Because these frameworks are typically even less developed in frontier markets, as well as various factors including the increased potential for extreme price volatility, illiquidity, trade barriers and exchange controls, the risks associated with emerging markets are magnified in frontier markets. Bond prices generally move in the opposite direction of interest rates. Thus, as prices of bonds in an investment portfolio adjust to a rise in interest rates, the value of the portfolio may decline.\\n\\n']}\n"

Natural gas implied volatility also averaged 77% in November, its highest level in 17 years, after hovering around 20% over the summer. Natural gas then declined 27% from its recent peak to $3.54/MMBtu on December 26. Despite all of the ups and downs over the last two months, it's not time to put away the Dramamine just yet. \\n\\n What's driving gas prices? When it comes to natural gas, the year is divided into an injection season and a withdrawal season. During the summer injection season, which lasts from April to October, gas consumption declines and surplus natural gas can be stored. In contrast, the winter withdrawal season, which is defined as November to March, is the time when consumption peaks. Natural gas that has been stored during injection season is withdrawn to meet heating and power generation needs in cold weather. According to the Energy Information Administration (EIA), Lower 48 gas storage levels as of October 31 totaled 3,208 billion cubic feet (Bcf), the lowest level at the end of an injection season since 2005. The EIA attributed the low inventories at the end of October to increases to gas storage during injection season that fell short of the five-year average and an unusually cold April, which delayed the injection season by approximately four weeks. Low storage levels entering winter, as shown in the chart below, are arguably the primary driver of the recent volatility in prices. The impact of lower gas inventories is greater supply uncertainty when demand increases and gas price volatility as seen over the last month.\\n \\n\\n How's the weather? Weather can have a significant impact on gas prices on a daily basis since natural gas is used as the primary heating fuel in nearly half of all US households. Additionally, approximately 40% of households rely on electricity for heat, with natural gas expected to account for a third of electricity generation this winter. One of the specific ways to measure the impact of winter weather is heating degree days (HDD), which are a relative measure of how cold a time period is. A large number of HDDs results in greater consumption of natural gas for heating homes and electricity generation, which can lead to higher prices for natural gas as demand increases. Notably, November had 14% more HDDs than the month's 10-year average, which contributed to last month's price spike. However, warmer weather across most of the US so far in December has sent natural gas prices lower. Since temperature variance is a major factor in determining consumption, weather forecasts are always in focus for natural gas observers, including the 8 to 14 day outlook from the National Weather Service Climate Prediction Center (CPC). On December 17, for instance, gas prices dropped nearly 8% after the CPC forecasted above-average temperatures for the eastern half of the US. For 2018-19, we could see a cold winter with an active polar vortex, like in 2013-2014, or a moderate winter due to continued weak El Niño conditions. El Niño generally leads to milder winters in the US, which could reduce the number of HDDs over the next few months and therefore keep gas price upside in check. In spite of El Niño, however, forecasters are closely watching the polar vortex for possible outbreaks of cold weather in January and February in the eastern half of the US, which could lead to higher gas prices.\\n What about production growth? Given record high natural gas production in the US and expectations for continued growth,1 one could argue that increased production should help alleviate the dependence on storage and contribute to less volatility, but November's price action refutes that. Near-term production growth without adequate pipeline takeaway capacity is not that helpful for natural gas prices, though sustained and elevated production levels do create an opportunity for midstream companies to build out pipelines and gas processing plants. As shown below, natural gas production growth has been dominated by the Marcellus/Utica and the Permian. Pipeline additions have helped debottleneck the Northeast, but Permian natural gas takeaway remains inadequate. Weather will likely contribute to volatility this winter, but continued production growth likely creates a ceiling for prices in the upcoming year, particularly as recently added takeaway capacity in the Northeast ramps and new gas pipelines come online in the Permian. \\n\\n Source: US Energy Information Administration Inadequate pipeline takeaway capacity is evidenced by outsized discounts between regional price markers and the Henry Hub benchmark (basis differentials). For example, the average discount for gas prices at the Dominion South hub in Pennsylvania relative to Henry Hub averaged over $1/MMBtu in 2016 and $0.90/MMBtu in 2017. The addition of pipeline takeaway capacity has narrowed the differential to $0.40/MMBtu on average in 2018. Meanwhile, Permian gas prices (Waha Hub) have seen an average discount of $1.10/MMBtu to Henry Hub this year, with discounts much wider ($2+) recently. Several pipelines have come online over the last two years to reduce takeaway constraints in the Northeast, including Williams Companies' (NYSE:WMB) Atlantic Sunrise project in October and Energy Transfer's (NYSE:ET) Rover Pipeline, which has gradually ramped since August 2017. The partial startup in October of Enbridge's (NYSE:ENB) NEXUS joint venture with DTE Energy has also helped ease constraints.\\n The Permian still awaits the debottlenecking that has helped the Northeast. Based on the futures curve, the differential between Henry Hub and Waha will likely remain wide until the second half of 2019 when new pipeline projects start up. The Gulf Coast Express Pipeline, which is being built by Kinder Morgan (NYSE:KMI) and its partners DCP Midstream (NYSE:DCP), Targa Resources (NYSE:TRGP), and Altus Midstream (ALTM), will carry up to 1.98 Bcf/d of natural gas from the Permian to Agua Dulce, TX, when it starts up in October 2019. Also slated to come online in 2019 is the 1.9 Bcf/d Pecos Trail Pipeline from private firms NAmerico and Cresta Energy. In late-2020, additional pipeline relief should come from the Permian Highway Pipeline - a 2 Bcf/d line from Waha to Katy being built by KMI and EagleClaw Midstream (ALTM also has an option acquire an equity interest in the line). As these pipelines come online and better connect supply with demand, perhaps next winter will see less volatility in natural gas. That said, there will be other notable changes for the natural gas market that could impact prices, including growing LNG exports as additional export capacity comes online next year (read more). The good news for midstream investors is that growing natural gas production creates opportunities for new projects with cash flows largely insulated from the price volatility discussed. Bottom Line Natural gas price volatility has returned and should continue through this winter as traders and investors follow weather and storage levels closely. Given production growth, midstream companies continue to have ample opportunities to construct new gas pipelines to connect production with key demand areas and coastal export sites. 1. US dry natural gas production is expected to average 83.3 billion cubic feet per day (Bcf/d) this year and to grow over 8% to 90.0 Bcf/d in 2019 according to the EIA's December Short-Term Energy Outlook.

An attractive dividend enhanced the gain of over 25% over the holding period for the shares which climbed steadily until reaching a peak at $52.06 in early October. Archer Daniels Midland (ADM) is a commodities company. The companies profile states: “Archer-Daniels-Midland Company procures, transports, stores, processes, and merchandises agricultural commodities, products, and ingredients in the United States and internationally. It operates through four segments: Carbohydrate Solutions, Nutrition, Oilseeds, and Origination. The company offers oilseeds, corn, wheat, milo, oats, rice, and barley; and structured trade finance, as well as processes wheat into wheat flour. It also provides sweeteners, starch, syrup, glucose, and dextrose; alcohol, amino acids, and other food and animal feed ingredients; ethyl alcohol; bio products; corn gluten feed and meal, and distillers' grains; vegetable oil and protein meal; formula feeds, and animal health and nutrition products; citric acids and glycols; glucose and native starch; and contract and private label pet treats and foods, and specialty ingredients. In addition, the company offers ingredients for the food, feed, energy, and industrial products industries; crude vegetable and salad oils; margarine, shortening, and other food products; partially refined oils; oilseed protein meals; peanuts, tree nuts, and peanut-derived ingredients; cottonseed flour for the pharmaceutical industry; cotton cellulose pulp for the chemical, paper, and filter markets; and agricultural commodity raw materials. Further, it is involved in oil palm cultivation, oilseeds crushing, edible oils refining, packaged oils and foods, sugar milling and refining, specialty fats, oleo chemicals, biodiesel and fertilizers manufacturing, and grains processing. Additionally, the company provides natural flavor ingredients, flavor systems, natural colors, proteins, emulsifiers, soluble fiber, polyols, hydrocolloids, natural health and nutrition products, and other specialty food and feed ingredients; edible beans; and futures commission merchant and insurance services. Archer-Daniels-Midland Company was founded in 1898 and is headquartered in Chicago, Illinois.”\\n Source: Yahoo Finance ADM’s fingerprints are evident in almost all shopping baskets at supermarkets. The company makes the critical ingredients that feed families around the United States and the world. Additionally, when we fill our automobiles with fuel, the ethanol mandate in the U.S. means that we are consuming another product from ADM. The company processes corn which is the primary ingredient in the biofuel. The gasoline we pump into our tanks is an ethanol blend containing 10% of the biofuel. ADM profits are the sum of its many businesses, but the margin for processing ethanol into gasoline is a revenue stream for the company. Those margins were weak in 2018 as the price of corn, the input, moved higher, and ethanol, the output, moved to a lower price level on the year. The rise in the price of ADM shares that took the price above the $52 level was the result of tax and regulatory reforms that lifted most stocks until the end of the year. At the same time, ADM’s trading arm positioned the company aggressively as the trade dispute between the U.S. and China caused dislocations that turned out to boost earnings. The majority of 2018 was a year where factors combined to create an almost perfect bearish storm for ADM. In Q4 2018, the bullish factors melted away and the stock dropped back to the level it was trading at in late 2017 at below $40 per share. As we head into 2019, it could be a good time to put ADM back on your investment radar for the coming year. I have not touched the stock since I took profits at above $50, but the recent action has created a sale, and at bargain basement prices the company that feeds and fuels the world could offer investors another opportunity for the coming year. The ethanol processing spread likely weighed on the price of ADM stock, but that could change in the coming year. Corn will post a gain in 2018 Despite the ongoing trade saga between the United States and China that has weighed on the prices of many agricultural commodities that come from the U.S., the price of corn is higher at the end of 2018 than it was at the end of 2017. The U.S. is the world’s leading producer and exporter of corn, and it is likely that no trade dispute would have led to an even greater year-on-year gain in 2018. \\n\\n\\n Source: CQG 2018 has been a volatile year in the corn futures market which traded in a range from $3.2975 to $4.1225 on the nearby futures contract. As the weekly chart highlights, the price of corn closed 2017 at $3.51 per bushel and was trading at $3.7450 on December 27, 6.7% higher on the year. The primary ingredient in ethanol in the United States posted a gain in 2018. Ethanol fell and put in a new record low Meanwhile, the rise in the price of corn in 2018, and a bull market in crude oil and gasoline prices from January through October 3 did little to support the price of ethanol throughout the year. \\n\\n Source: CQG As the chart of nearby ethanol futures illustrates, the biofuel traded in a range from $1.198 to $1.535 per gallon wholesale throughout 2018. Ethanol began to decline in mid-March, and while crude oil and gasoline prices made higher lows and higher highs until October, ethanol did just the opposite. In November, ethanol fell to its low for the year which was also a record low for the biofuel. Nearby ethanol futures closed 2017 at $1.3290 per gallon. The winter season is typically a time of the year when the price of the biofuel moves lower because it is the offseason for gasoline demand. As of December 27, the nearby biofuel futures were at the $1.24 level, or 6.7% lower for the year. The lower price of ethanol and higher price of corn means that the processing margins for refiners of the grain into the biofuel declined on a year-on-year basis. Since ADM is involved in both the grain and energy sector when it comes to producing the fuel, the lower processing spreads have weighed on earnings in that segment of their business. Energy prices did not support the biofuel in late 2018\\n The environment for energy companies got progressively worse starting on October 3 when the price of nearby NYMEX crude oil futures hit its highest level since 2014 at $76.90 per barrel. \\n\\n Source: CQG As the weekly chart shows, the price of the energy commodity began to fall, and as of December 24, it had not stopped its descent. On Christmas Eve, the price dropped to its latest low at $42.36 per barrel, 44.9% below its October 3 high. Meanwhile, the price of gasoline tends to drop during the winter months, but the fuel has tanked since October, no pun intended. \\n\\n Source: CQG The weekly chart of nearby gasoline futures shows that the price of the fuel dropped from $2.15 per gallon on October 3 to $1.2450 this week, a decline of 42% over the past three months. Ethanol demand has suffered under the weight of lower energy prices over recent months. The stock market and biofuels have been a toxic bearish cocktail for the ADM share price- Politics favor ethanol in 2019 A combination of lower energy prices, deteriorating fundamentals for ethanol processing margins, and the ongoing impact of the trade dispute between the U.S. and China have weighed on ADM’s earnings. However, in the future, lower energy prices are likely to lower the cost of goods sold for the company. Moreover, the massive selling that has hit the stock market has taken anything with a ticker symbol lower, and ADM has been no exception. As we move into 2019, the politics of ethanol is not likely to change. The ethanol mandate is a subject of continuing debate in the U.S. as oil companies have lobbied against a continuation of blending the biofuel with gasoline. President Trump’s base of support includes many farmers across the grain belt who have stuck with the President despite the negative impact of the trade issues with China. As the 2020 Presidential election approaches, the Trump administration is not likely to bend to pressure from the oil companies that would inflict further financial woes on grain producers. At the same time, the House of Representatives will contain a Democratic majority starting in January of the coming year. The new majority party is likely to favor policies that support environmental regulations, and the ethanol mandate has long been a central spoke to reduce emissions in the United States. Therefore, the prospects for the ethanol price which reached a record low in late 2018 are favorable which limits the downside potential for the price of the biofuel.\\n ADM is entering the buy zone again at the end of 2018 ADM shares are back where they were trading last year at this time at under $40 per share. ADM has a price to earnings multiple of 9.83 times earnings at a closing price of $39.62 per share on December 24. The company pays a 3.25% dividend at its current price. \\n\\n Source: Barchart As the chart shows, technical support for ADM stands at the November 2017 low at $38.59 per share which is less than $1 below its low on December 26 at $39.16 per share. ADM has declined back into the buy zone, and I will begin to buy shares below $40. However, given the volatility in the stock market and the potential for additional tax loss selling over the final sessions of 2018, I will be leaving plenty of room to add on further price weakness at the end of this year and into the start of 2019. Crude oil, the stock market, and many other assets have been falling knives at the end of 2018 which has pushed the price of ADM shares to levels where it is attractive once again. I will be taking a conservative approach to buying this company over the coming weeks, but at its current level, the company that is the supermarket to the world offers investors value once again.\\nThe Hecht Commodity Report is the most comprehensive commodities reports available today from the top-ranked ranked author in both commodities, forex, and precious metals.

Then again, nothing has changed since that article in April entitled This Is Not A Market. I was right then, and I still am.    [..] markets need price discovery as much as price discovery needs markets. They are two sides of the same coin. Markets are the mechanism that makes price discovery possible, and vice versa. Functioning markets, that is. Given the interdependence between the two, we must conclude that when there is no price discovery, there are no functioning markets. And a market that doesn\\'t function is not a market at all. [..] we must wonder why everyone in the financial world, and the media, is still talking about \\'the markets\\' (stocks, bonds et al) as if they still existed. Is it because they think there still is price discovery? Or do they think that even without price discovery, you can still have functioning markets? Or is their idea that a market is still a market even if it doesn\\'t function?  But perhaps that is confusing, and confusion in and of itself doesn\\'t lead to better understanding. So, maybe, I should call what there is out there today \\'zombie markets\\'. It doesn\\'t really make much difference. What murdered functioning markets is intervention by central banks, in alleged attempts to save those same markets. Cue your favorite horror movie. Now, Jerome Powell and the Fed he inherited are apparently trying to undo the misery Greenspan, Bernanke and Yellen before him wrought upon the economic system, and people, cue Trump, get into fights about that one. All the while still handing the Fed, the ECB, the BoJ, much more power than they should ever have been granted. And you won\\'t get actual markets back until that power is wrested from their cold dead zombie fingers. Even then, the damage will be hard to oversee, and it will take decades. The bankers and investors their free and easy trillions were bestowed upon will be just fine, thank you, but everyone else will definitely not be.\\n Central banks don\\'t serve societies, they serve banks. They fool everyone, politicians first of all, into believing that societies automatically do well if only the demands of banks are met first, and as obviously stupid as that sounds, nary a squeak of protest can be heard. Least of all from \\'market participants\\' who have done nothing for the better part of this millennium except feast at the teat of main street largesse. In the past few days, we\\'ve had both - stock - market rallies and plunges of 5% or so, and people have started to realize that is not normal, and it scares them. So, you get Tyler posting DataTrek\\'s Nicolas Colas saying \"Healthy\" Markets Don\\'t Rally 1,086 Points On The Dow. Well, he\\'s kinda right, but there hasn\\'t been a healthy market in 10+ years, and he\\'s missed that last bit. Like most people have who work in those so-called \\'markets\\'. Here\\'s why Colas is right but doesn\\'t understand why. Price discovery is the flip side of the coin that is a functional market, because it allows for people to see why something is valued at the level it is, by a large(r) number of participants. Take that away, and it is obvious that violent price swings may start occurring as soon as the comforting money teat stutters, or even just threatens to do so; a rumor is enough. In physics terms, price discovery, and therefore markets themselves - provided they\\'re \\'healthy\\' and \\'functioning\\' - delivers negative feedback to the system, i.e. it injects self-correcting measures. Take away price discovery, in other words, kill the market, and you get positive feedback, where - simplified - changes tend to lead to ever bigger changes until something breaks. Also, different markets, like stocks, bonds, housing, will keep a check on each other, so nothing will reach insane valuations. If they tend to, people stop buying and will shift their money somewhere else. But when everything has an insane value, how would people know what\\'s insane anymore, and where could they shift that is not insane?\\n It doesn\\'t matter much for \\'market participants\\', or \\'investors\\' as they prefer to label themselves, they shift trillions around on a daily basis just to justify their paychecks, but for mom and pop, it\\'s a whole different story. In between the two, you have pension funds, whose rapid forced move from AAA assets to risk will strangle mom and pop\\'s old-age plans no matter what. People inevitably talk about the chances of a recession happening, but maybe, they should first ask what exactly a recession, or a bear market, is or means when it occurs in a zombie (or just plain dead) market. If asset \\'values\\' have increased by 50% because central banks and companies themselves have bought stocks, it would seem logical that a 10% drop doesn\\'t have the same meaning as it would in a marketplace where no such manipulation has taken place. Maybe a 50% drop would make more sense then. The inevitable future is that people are going to get tired of borrowing as soon as it becomes too expensive, hence unattractive, to do so. Central banks can still do more QE and keep rates low for longer, but that\\'s not an infinity and beyond move. It a simple question of the longer it lasts, the higher will be the price that has to be paid. One more, one last, simple question: who\\'s going to pay? We all know, don\\'t we? That\\'s where the Fed is now. You can let interest rates rise, as Powell et al are indicating they want to do, but that will cut off debt growth, and since debt is exclusively what keeps the economy going, it will cut into economic growth as well. Or you can keep interest rates low (and lower), but then, people have less and less idea of the actual value of assets, which can, and eventually necessarily will, cause people to flee from these assets. Powell\\'s rate hikes schedule looks nice from a normalizing point of view, and g-d knows what normal is anymore, but it would massacre the zombie markets the Fed itself created when it decided to kill the actual markets. You can get back to normal, but only if the Fed retreats into the Eccles Building and stays there until 2050 or so (or is abolished).\\n They won\\'t, the banks whose interests they protect will soon be in far too dire straits, and bailouts have become much harder to come by since 2008. It\\'ll be a long time before markets actually function again, and we won\\'t get there without a world of pain. Which will be felt by those who never participated in the so-called markets, to begin with. Beware of yellow vests. To top off the perversity of zombie markets, one more thing. Zombie markets build overcapacity. One of the best things price discovery brings to an economy is that it lets zombies die, that bankrupt companies and bankrupt ideas go the way of the dodo. That, again, is negative feedback. Take that away, as low rates and free money do, and you end up with positive feedback, which makes zombies appear alive, and distorts the valuation of everything. Most of what the \\'popular\\' financial press discusses is about stocks, what the Dow and S&P have done for the day. But the bond markets are much bigger. So, what are we to think when the two are completely out of sync - and whack - ? \\n\\n Oh well, those are just \\'the markets\\', and we already know that they are living dead. Where that may be less obvious, if only because nobody wants it to be true, is in housing markets. Which, though this is being kept from you with much effort, are what\\'s keeping the entire US, and most of Europe\\'s, economies going. And guess what? The Fed and Draghi have just about hit the max on home prices (check 2019 for the sequel). Prices have gotten too high, Jay Powell wants higher interest rates, Draghi can\\'t be left too far behind him because EU money would all flow to the US, and it\\'s all well on its way to inevitability. And anyway, the only thing that\\'s being achieved with ever higher home prices is ever more debt for the people who buy them, and who will all be on the hook if those prices are subject to the negative feedback loops healthy markets must be subject too, or else.\\n The only parties who have profited from rising home prices are the banks which dole out the mortgages and the zombie economy that relies on them creating the money society runs on that way. We have all come to rely on a bunch of zombies to keep ourselves from debt slavery, and no, zombies are not actually alive. Nor are the financial markets, and the economies, that prop them up. Among the first things in 2019, you will see enormous amounts of junk rated debt getting rated ever - and faster - lower, and the pace at which ever more debt that is not yet junk, downgraded to(wards) junk, accelerating. It looks like the zombies can never totally take over, but that is little comfort to those neck-deep in debt even before we start falling. And as for the \\'players\\', the economic model will allow again for them to shove the losses of their brain-dead ventures onto the destiny of those with ever lower paying jobs, who if they\\'re lucky enough to be young enough, start their careers in those jobs with ever higher student debts. You\\'d think that at some point they should be happy they were never sufficiently credit-worthy to afford one of the grossly overpriced properties that are swung like so many carrots before their eyes, but that\\'s not how the system works. The system will always find a way to keep pushing them deeper into the financial swamp somehow. The last remaining growth industry our societies have left is inequality, and that\\'s what our central banks and governments are all betting on to keep Jack Sparrow\\'s Flying Dutchman afloat for a while longer. Where the poor get squeezed more so the 1% or 10% get to look good a little longer. But in the end, it\\'s all zombies all the way down, like the turtles, and some equivalent of the yellow vests will pop up in unexpected places. My prediction for next year. It doesn\\'t look to me that, a year from now, we\\'ll see 2019 as a particular peaceful year, not at all like 2018. I called it from Chaos to Mayhem earlier, and I\\'m sticking with that. We\\'re done borrowing from the future, it\\'s getting time to pay back those loans from that future.\\n And that ain\\'t going to happen when there are no functioning markets; after all, how does anyone know what to pay back when the only thing they do know is everything is way overvalued? How wrong can I be when I say debts will only be paid back at fair value? 2019, guys, big year.\\n']}\n"

Higher oil prices for most of 2018 helped push the state\\'s crude production to all-time highs, aided by Marathon Oil Corporation (NYSE:MRO) allocating more to developing the play in 2018. During the third quarter of 2018, Marathon Oil pumped 85,000 barrels of oil equivalent net per day. Note that 85% of that was oil, making this play highly levered to changes in West Texas Intermediate and the Clearbrook benchmark. Let\\'s dig in. Asset overview Marathon Oil owns the lease on 270,000 net acres that are prospective for Bakken and Three-Forks well locations, primarily if not entirely in North Dakota. The region is generally referred to as the Bakken play due to the Middle Bakken offering more compelling economics than the Three-Forks benches. At a different time when oil prices were much higher, there was also serious development activity in Montana. That is no longer the case as non-core Bakken acreage is very unappealing. Analysts cited by E&P Mag noted that \"breakeven prices for the best Bakken wells are well below $40/bbl WTI\" and that the \"majority of wells have breakeven prices below $60.\" Tier 1 well locations are quite economical, but note that Bakken oil realizations measured by the Clearbrook benchmark are $3-5/barrel below WTI. That differential is expected to move down to $2-3/barrel by 2020 according to the futures curve. Note that North Dakotan oil production that is piped to Cushing will still ultimately fetch less than WTI when considering the relatively higher transportation costs. Over the past year, Marathon Oil\\'s completed well costs had dropped by 20% per lateral foot through the end of Q3 2018. That played a big role in keeping portions of its Bakken position relevant in a volatile market. Bakken development activity is centered on Dunn, McKenzie, and Mountrail counties. According to Marathon Oil\\'s 2017 10-K filing:\\n \"The majority of our acreage is in core prospects within McKenzie, Mountrail, and Dunn Counties in North Dakota. We continue focusing on the high-return Myrmidon area building on the successes from our enhanced completion designs, as well as delineating our position in Hector.\" The company doesn\\'t break down its acreage position by county, but one can get a rough idea of its footprint by utilizing information from a speech management gave in May 2018. Vice President Mike Henderson noted that Marathon Oil had the lease on 115,000 acres (not clear if that is gross or net) in Dunn County in what the firm refers to as the Hector development area. Management also commented that this position was \"about twice the size of Myrmidon,\" the firm\\'s Tier 1 development area in North Dakota that primarily resides in southern Mountrail County but also stretches west to parts of McKenzie County. As the source of Marathon Oil\\'s most prolific Bakken and Three-Forks wells, the Myrmidon area is only 55,000-60,000 acres in size. Even if that was its net acreage position, note that is only a fifth of Marathon Oil\\'s entire Bakken footprint. At a certain point, Marathon Oil will run out of Tier 1 well locations and future development activity will be contingent on the firm growing its drilling inventory. Marathon Oil brought the six-well Tat 13 Pad online in the Myrmidon region in Q3 2018. Those wells had an average 30-day IP (initial-production) rate of 4,745 BOE/d per well with a 73% crude oil cut. For comparison, Marathon Oil turned 21 gross Bakken/Three-Forks wells online that quarter which had an average 30-day IP rate of 3,460 BOE/d with a 76% crude oil cut. What made the Tat 13 Pad all the more exciting is that this pad includes three Three-Forks wells, most notably the monster Jerome well that yielded a 30-day IP rate of 6,380 BOE/d with a 75% crude oil mix. As I stated up above, normally Middle Bakken wells are more productive and economical. If Marathon Oil can find a way to consistently bring wells like Jerome online in the Myrmidon region, then it could potentially add Three-Forks well locations to its Tier 1 drilling inventory.\\n To further increase the number well locations in its Bakken portfolio, Marathon Oil has been running tests in other development areas to see how prolific those wells can be when utilizing modern completion designs. Those locations include the Elks Creek, Hector, and Ajax development areas, all of which are in Dunn County. Below is a map that highlights where these areas are located in North Dakota (note this is current as of Q2 2018). \\n\\n Source: Marathon Oil Corporation Targeting new development areas Marathon Oil announced the three-well Bear Den Pad had reached an average 30-day IP rate of 2,528 BOE/d with a 72% crude oil cut during the second quarter of 2018. No new wells appeared to have come online in the Elks Creek development area since then, and as you can see below, the region was recently removed from its IR presentations. \\n\\n Source: Marathon Oil Corporation The Hector and Ajax development areas have historically been not as productive as other parts of the Bakken play. Completion designs had to be modified to try and make central Dunn County acreage economical. Marathon Oil leveraged improvements learned elsewhere to see what could be done. In December 2018, the company was happy to announce that its four-well Ajax pad pilot project had been a success. Those four wells had an average 30-day IP rate of 2,400 BOE/d with an 84% crude oil cut. True, that is just a four well test, which is why the Lars Pad in the Hector development area is important. The two-well Lars Pad tapped into the Three-Forks formation and reached an average 30-day IP rate of 1,810 BOE/d with an 83% crude oil cut. Management noted:\\n \"Strong early results in Ajax mark another important step forward in our ongoing efforts to extend the core of our Bakken acreage position, building upon recent successful core extension tests in Elk Creek and Southern Hector,\" said Marathon Oil President and CEO Lee Tillman. \"Through enhanced area-specific completion designs, and a lot of hard work from our Bakken team, we continue to meaningfully uplift the quality of our inventory while also driving Basin leading performance.\" As things stand today, outside of the Myrmidon region, most of the locations Marathon Oil is uncovering are Tier 2 opportunities at best. While those well locations can break even in a ~$50-60/barrel WTI environment, that isn\\'t the same as adding locations that can break even below when WTI is below $40/barrel. It is important to note that the biggest source of upside is likely to come from Marathon Oil adding Three-Forks well locations to its drilling inventory in the Myrmidon in the medium-term. Longer term, cost reductions and productivity increases may push some of those Tier 2 locations into the Tier 1-1.5 category. Final thoughts With WTI struggling to get above $50/barrel, Marathon Oil Corporation will likely scale back its Bakken development activity in 2019 if things don\\'t change. That would be a prudent financial decision as the upstream firm\\'s unhedged North Dakotan oil realizations are well below $50/barrel as of this writing. In the event the OPEC+ deal helps stimulate a rebound in global oil prices, then the Bakken play offers Marathon Oil Corporation a solid oil-rich growth runway.

Software This is the part that is perhaps the most interesting, with a number of offerings: Design optimization Materialise 3-matic File preparation  Materialise Magics Materialise Magics Essentials Materialise MiniMagics Materialise e-Stage  3D manufacturing  Materialise Build Processor Materialise Control Platform Materialise Inspector  AM production process\\n  Materialise Streamics Materialise Robot  The segment is growing pretty fast (+17.2% in Q3 y/y) and it has the highest margins, so this is a double bonus. \\n\\n Its software is highly regarded and has been material in deals like those with BASF, and then BASF and Essentium and Siemens. The strategic cooperation with BASF is geared towards new materials (especially plastics) and results will enter the market next year. Virtuous cycle There exists something of a virtuous cycle between software and hardware. This becomes apparent with the acquisition of ACTech early October last year adding to its metal handling capabilities, from the PR: Through the acquisition, we are further enhancing the manufacturing and software backbone position that will support the entire industry. For over 27 years, we have always been there as a leading, comprehensive provider of solutions in industrial polymers printing. That position has enabled us to both develop and serve a growing demand for certified manufacturing with dedicated software and solutions. By joining forces with ACTech, we will accelerate that same strategy for metal manufacturing Basically, practical experience with 3D printing drives better software solutions in an iterative process. Or take the following (Q3CC): At Formnext, we\\'ll deliver another proof of this fruitful interaction between our manufacturing and software segments with a full release of the metal simulation module in Magics. This simulation module which was announced almost a year ago in collaboration with Simufact is the result of extensive internal experimentation. A thorough validation on the big amount of historical tracking data in our own Metal 3D Printing Competence Center in Bremen demonstrates that with the use of the new simulation module, we would have been able to predict and prevent 100% of the flaws and errors in historical problematic both.\\n And this, of course, drives substantial printing improvements as simulation is integrated into their Magics software suite and e-Stage for metal software. It\\'s no surprise that management argued (Q3CC): While our Manufacturing segment delivers valuable feedback to our researchers who develop products and software, the Manufacturing segment itself is the first to benefit from the use of our new tools as shown in this segment\\'s increasing margin and our ability to do innovative projects. Medical Medical 3D printing is just taking off, so this is a valuable growth segment for the company, and it had a good quarter: \\n\\n It\\'s the fastest growing segment, revenue grew by 23% in Q3 y/y. The company will demonstrate improvements in their Mimics Innovation Suite, the engine that is used for designing custom implants and devices. The company has a cooperation agreement with Stratasys (SSYS) producing patient-specific, life-like anatomical models for diagnostic purposes in conjunction with other tools and expert clinical judgement. The company holds an important advantage here, FDA clearance (PR): In March of 2018, Materialise Mimics inPrint was cleared by the FDA, becoming the only solution with 510(K) clearance as an end-to-end 3D printing solution, as well as a fully comprehensive 3D printing solution for anatomical modeling. According to company reports, of the top 20 U.S. hospitals as ranked by U.S. News & World Report, 16 have implemented a medical 3D printing strategy using Materialise Mimics technology. It was the first company to be cleared by the FDA for this and a similar clearance in South Korea. The company also holds some 160 patents in the medical field. And the company has a substantial medical business:\\n Materialise contracts with more than 500 hospitals and health care companies that includes the University of Michigan, Beaumont Hospital, Henry Ford Hospital, Detroit Medical Center and Spectrum Health to develop 3-D patient anatomy models and to help plan out medical procedures with doctors... Each year, Materialise produces 150,000 medical parts for 50,000 patients in cardiovascular, craniomaxillofacial, orthopedics and pulmonology, Crutchfield said. \"We have six laser machines and seven (stereolithography) machines here. They run all night and in the morning we do cleaning and maintenance on them,\" he said \"The latest generation is three times faster than the previous one. The next will be five times faster. We (the industry) are constantly improving.\" Margins \\n\\nMTLS Gross Profit Margin (Quarterly) data by YCharts Gross profits increased 48% in Q3 y/y (25% without ACTech) and gross margin increased to 63% (from 55% a year ago). Operating expenses increased 26% (15% ex ACTech) leading to an operating profit of €2.3M, so the acquisition of ACTech actually produced some operational leverage. Adjusted EBITDA increased by 116% to €7 million (44% without ACTEch), but they were inflated by a one-off tax contribution of €2.4M. Adjusted EBITDA margin rose 500 basis points from 10% to 15%. But it\\'s good to know that all three segments experienced an adjusted EBITDA margin increase organically. Medical experienced a record adjusted EBITDA margin of 19.3%, up from 11.2% a year ago and they are aiming for this sector to go above 20%. In software, EBITDA increased from Q1 over Q2 to Q3 from 28% to 31% to 34.3% in Q3, but it was even higher (39.9%) in Q3 of 2017. The operational improvement is likely to continue (Q3CC, our evidence):\\n Total deferred revenue amounted to €27.5 million as compared to €22.6 million as of end last year. Of the €27.5 million, €20 million were related to annual software sales and maintenance contracts compared to €18.7 million also at the end of last year. You should bear in mind to this cumulative amount of €20 million on our balance sheet also reflects to a very large extent deferred operating profit. Guidance Management argues that results will come in the high range of the guidance on all three metrics: \\n\\n Cash \\n\\nMTLS Cash from Operations (TTM) data by YCharts Cash flows are following the operational improvements. The balance sheet has been tidied up quite a bit: \\n\\n While debt increased by €9.5M to €107.7M after a €10M drawing from the EIB, a 3M shares public offering at $13 per ADS and a €25M injection from BASF have improved the cash position such that net debt is now a negative €7M. \\n\\nMTLS Stock-Based Compensation (TTM) data by YCharts\\n Valuation \\n\\nMTLS EV to EBITDA (TTM) data by YCharts The company doesn\\'t have a history of profitability as it has just moved into the black. With the operational improvements, EV/EBITDA valuation has improved, although the December rally has made the shares quite a bit more expensive again. The sales multiple is near the upper range of what we would expect and it\\'s also historically high, although that\\'s no surprise given the operational improvements. Conclusion There are enough things to like in the company:  Long growth path ahead, we\\'re only in the first innings of 3D printing. Strong IP portfolio. Growing software and medical business. Its medical business seems to hold first mover advantage with respect to regulatory approval and IP. Virtuous cycle between software and printing. Operational results are improving, the company moved into the black. Organic growth returned in Q3.  There are some caveats though:  The shares have jumped quite a bit in December and are now fairly valued. There is significant competition in the industrial sector. The predicted growth revival in European automotive might not materialize.  All in all, after December\\'s jump has to be digested, we don\\'t see an immediate jump higher, but this is a solid long-term play based on its capabilities, especially in the medical field and its software.\\nDisclosure: I/we have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

Although his signature hedge fund has underperformed the S&P 500 in recent years, Einhorn\\'s cumulative track record of 15.4% annualized over 22 years, net of fees and expenses, is still one of the best in the business. The market has dropped since Einhorn sold his position in Twitter, Twitter has dropped even more, and today\\'s investors can buy Twitter closer to the price at which he bought the stock than the price at which he sold. Should they? I find Twitter to be an interesting opportunity given the massive disparity between the company\\'s enormous cultural relevance and its surprisingly small market cap relative to other technology stocks, which was one of the factors that drove Einhorn\\'s original investment thesis. Twitter is the most widely used and widely referenced publicly traded social media company next to Facebook (FB), yet it only has an enterprise value of about 5% of Facebook\\'s. Unlike Facebook, its popularity among young people isn\\'t experiencing a secular decline. Unlike Snapchat (SNAP), its core product isn\\'t enormously pressured by a deep-pocketed competitor like Instagram that may very likely put the company entirely out of business.\\n After years of posting losses, Twitter will report its first time ever trailing 12 month profit this year. Today\\'s investors can buy in at about the same price as the $26 IPO in 2013, but today\\'s Twitter is a much healthier company financially than it was five years ago. With co-founder Jack Dorsey back at the helm, 8 consecutive quarters of earnings estimate beats, growing ad engagements and declining engagement costs, and continued free publicity from being the social media platform of choice for the sitting U.S. President, all signs point towards a turnaround for Twitter. Some have expressed justifiable reservations about Dorsey serving as chief executive for two publicly traded companies simultaneously, but there\\'s no question that he is deeply committed to Twitter. He gave away a third of his Twitter shares, worth nearly $200 million, back to employees to boost morale when he first returned. Unlike Alphabet\\'s Larry Page, he actually showed up at the Senate Intelligence Committee hearing this summer despite Twitter being a fraction of Alphabet\\'s size. Whether Dorsey will be as effective as shareholders hope remains to be seen, but there is no question that his heart is in the right place. On the topic of congressional hearings: Twitter, as a platform for public interaction, is unique among its technology peers for being partially insulated against the dark cloud of potential data privacy regulations looming in the horizon. Twitter users, unlike Facebook users, don\\'t sign up for the service with an expectation of privacy: the whole point of the platform is to broadcast your thoughts to the world. Although no one knows what shape or form any future data regulation laws will take, Twitter\\'s business should adapt to a harsher regulatory environment better than competitors. There is currently a lot of misguided public outrage over Facebook selling user data that stems from a fundamental misunderstanding of how Facebook the company works, but Twitter actually does sell your data, and everyone is fine with it. A full 14% of Twitter\\'s revenues, worth $333 million the previous fiscal year, come from its data licensing operation which gives partners access to data from its public feed. Twitter\\'s monetization of its public data offers partners a unique product in the social media space, and investors a competitive advantage to supplement its core advertising business.\\n Digital advertising is a high growth industry, both in absolute dollar terms and as a share of total global ad spend. As a second tier digital ad company, Twitter is positioned to benefit from spillover effects as competition within the Google-Facebook duopoly becomes more crowded and advertisers\\' returns on investment drop due to higher engagement costs, pay-per-click bidding wars, and a growing supply of advertising dollars chasing the same amount of user attention. For advertisers, your partner\\'s brand doesn\\'t matter all that much; getting a click is far more important than where that click comes from. Google and Facebook reigned supreme during the initial wave of digital advertising growth, but as the industry matures, competitive forces will naturally drive businesses to alternative platforms with lower costs and higher ROI, a trend that can bring a lot of customers to Twitter\\'s doorstep independent of any marketing efforts from the company itself. Should Twitter investors expect significant monthly and daily active user growth? Not necessarily. For such a cultural behemoth, Twitter\\'s user base is relatively small, clocking in at 326 million MAUs as of the latest quarterly report, with only 67 million in the US. It\\'s easy to fall prey to the availability heuristic bias and overestimate Twitter\\'s relevance to the average person due to its disproportionate representation in the media. Twitter\\'s trend-driven microblogging service makes it the platform of choice for journalists, celebrities, politicians, and people with lots of opinions they want to express (like investment writers!). This means it\\'s used by a very vocal minority ... but a minority nonetheless. For the average person whose social media interactions are mostly confined within their real life social circles, Facebook is a necessity to stay connected and Twitter is that app they frequently see in the news and in memes, but don\\'t use themselves. A 2015 Wired article written by \"an actual teen\" reported that most teenagers \"simply do not understand the point of Twitter,\" a problem that persists today among all age groups given Twitter\\'s ongoing onboarding struggles. The opportunity for improvement exists, but it\\'s important to recognize that while Twitter is the only notable player in a niche space, it is still a niche space, one that is susceptible to social usage trends in either direction and where growth is not guaranteed.\\n Is Twitter worth buying at today\\'s price? Einhorn bought Twitter under the rationale that it was underpriced at 2% of Facebook\\'s market cap. As Twitter has grown more expensive and Facebook significantly cheaper, that number today is closer to 4-5% depending on whether you choose to back out cash holdings. In the current market, I still prefer Facebook. But Twitter still remains a solid pick with great prospects, especially for investors who don\\'t like Facebook, and worth watching for all investors. Either a large downward movement in price or a significant improvement in business execution would warrant a buy. Twitter is far from a traditional value stock, being naturally a bit of a risky play due to its rich price-earnings ratio (in the 60s after normalizing for tax shenanigans), but overall I believe the company is moving in the right direction and the stock has a lot of potential for market-beating returns. In addition to organically increasing ad revenue, possible catalysts for growth include more effective monetization of its user base, platform improvements to make the service more relevant to the average consumer, and of course, its continued existence as a potential M&A target for one of the FAANGs (my money is on Google if an acquisition actually happens). With its bottom line finally out of the red and into the black, Twitter has turned a crucial corner, and time is now on its side.\\nDisclosure: I am/we are long FB.

At the time of writing, active front-month futures are trading around $0.72, down more than 9%, from $0.78 at the beginning of 2018. Currently, I expect prices to trade around $0.70 to $0.80 for the next few months. Buying the dip on low and selling into any short-term rally may be the best way to play the cotton market. Before we get into the details, let's travel briefly back in time to 2011 and revisit the story of how cotton reached its all-time high with my fellow readers. Prior to the 2010/2011 season, world cotton ending stocks had suffered several years of consecutive decline. Global cotton ending stocks fell from 62,987 (1,000 480lb Bales) in the 2006/2007 season to 46,197 (1,000 480lb Bales) by the end of 2009/2010 season. Stock-to-use ratio fell from 53% to a dangerously low 39%.   Year Beginning Stock Production Dom. Consumption Ending Stock Stock-to-Use ratio   2006/07 61,906 122,685 122,493 62,987 51%   2007/08 62,987 120,049 121,743 61,878 50%   2008/09 61,878 108,069 108,860 61,453 56%   2009/10 61,453 103,084 119,482 46,179 39%   2010/11 46,179 117,298 115,611 49,263 43%   Source: USDA Cotton World Market and Trade Report ; (1,000 480lb Bales) During the season, Pakistan suffered one of its worst floods in recent history. Some ready cotton crops were reportedly destroyed. India, the world's second largest cotton exporter at the time, placed export restrictions due to rising domestic prices. Australia was also reportedly suffering from floods and unfavorable weather, and production figures were expected to be low. In October 2010, the USDA cut cotton production and stock estimates for China and cotton prices immediately reacted. The already expensive cotton rallied from $1.00s early October 2010 to $2.20s March 2011, as the wildest dream of every cotton producer and bullish speculator came true.\\n Veteran commodity traders knew such crazy price spikes cannot last. Farmers reacted to $2.20 cotton and planted more cotton next season; meanwhile, the demand side of the equation suffered due to high prices, cotton shortage eventually eased. Prices fell like a rock ever since, reaching as low as $0.55 early 2016. \\n\\n Source: tradingcharts.com; cotton monthly continuous chart The legacy of $2.20 cotton While $2.20 may be memories of a distant past for us, its legacy remains. China, seeking cotton supply security to protect itself from future shortages, established a price floor for local farmers on cotton around March 2011 in an effort to boost production when global cotton prices were soaring to the moon. When market price fell below the price floor, the Chinese government would then step in and purchase physical cotton at the set price during harvests, temporarily store it in state reserves, and sell it during time of shortage. The original intention of the policy was to ensure farmer's profitability, thus stability in cotton production and national security for China. Unfortunately, like many good-willed government actions, intervening in the free market always leads to negative unintended consequences. Because the price floor was set too high, local farmers produced much more cotton in the coming season even as global price crashed. Globally, farmers were reacting to high cotton prices and production hit record highs as well. As a result, China cotton ending stocks ballooned to as high as 14.5 MMT by the end of season 2014/2015, more than half the world cotton production at the time (world production: 24.2 MMT). The cost of storing those cotton became very burdensome for the Chinese government, and the Chinese textile industry, suffering from artificially high domestic cotton prices, moved many of their mills overseas in order to survive.\\n Lower Chinese cotton state reserves bode well for prices ahead The Chinese government soon reversed their policy and embarked on a multi-year de-stocking journey. Since 2015, the Chinese government continued selling their state reserves at a steady pace of 10 million bales a year. Understandably, this has depressed prices throughout the years. The USDA estimates that China will have around 30 million bales of cotton at the end of 2018/2019 season, less than half of the 65 million bales during its peak. \\n\\n China Cotton Stock lower in 2018/2019; Source: USDA The reduced cotton stock in China is very positive for prices going forward. For years, high Chinese cotton stock had been acting as an albatross around the neck of cotton price. So, as long as high stocks remain available, cotton prices have no chance at any sort of sustained rally because everyone knew Chinese could have easily dumped a lot of cotton onto the market if there were a shortage and price spike. With the high inventory coming down, a major anchor for the cotton market has finally been removed - the next time we suffer a shortage due to underproduction, prices may easily move higher past $1 mark. USDA estimates global ending stock at 73.19 million bales for the current 2018/2019 season. With a stock to use ratio of 58%, we are currently near the higher end of normal range. However, we need to keep in mind as well that nearly half of these stocks are in the hand of Chinese, and elsewhere in the world, the supply situation is actually tighter (51%) than what we think. I do not like to use ex-China stock figure to paint a bullish picture on any commodity, but we certainly need to take such cases into consideration when performing supply and demand analysis.\\n \\n\\n World Cotton Supply and Use; Source: USDA Not all rainbows and unicorns for cotton This does not mean cotton is going to soar above $1.00 and we should all go long today. After two consecutive deficit seasons, cotton tried to rally late 2017. Prices hit as high as $0.95 and some market participants thought it could even fly past $1.00. Unfortunately, for bulls, cotton stocks are still ample, and the trade war went into full swing this summer, affecting sentiments. Markets pulled back rather quickly as the tariffs hit and optimism faded. On 2nd December, President Trump and President Xi declared a trade truce, and cotton prices, along with most other commodities, rose sharply. The rally couldn't last, however, and prices turned lower in search of a bottom. \\n\\n Trade truce or not, prices continue to decline from the summer high; Source: Investing.com  Cotton bulls should not count on an announcement from the Chinese government to import a large amount of cotton from the United States as well. First of all, the Chinese government is still trying to de-stock and sell off their state reserves in this season. What's the point of buying from the US today and auctioning reserves tomorrow? It's not the Chinese government's job to trade cotton. Even if they do make such an announcement, it's still hard for me to be bullish. China announced multiple soybean purchases after the trade truce, yet soybean prices are trading lower today compared to December 3rd, the day after the trade truce was declared. I feel any sustained price rally will have to come from real consumer demand, and cutting tariffs back to zero will be the best way to stimulate import and real demand in China.\\n Going into next season, expectations are high that the US will produce a large cotton crop. Dr. John Robinson reportedly said that he expects the next cotton crop to be as large as 21 million bales (2018 est: 18.59 million bales). This has likely contributed to the most recent selloff. Currently, I expect prices to consolidate around these levels and reach a range of 70-80 cents. Recent reports regarding poor weather in India capping production is likely to provide support and prevent further price weakness, at least in the short term. USDA will provide the first forecast on next season's crop size in their May WASDE report. If the rest of the world happens to plant more cotton than the previous season as well, then prices could certainly move lower going forward. Bottom line  Cotton to trade range-bound within 70-80 cents. The US is likely to produce a larger crop in the next season. Trade cotton within the range, with a bearish bias. \\nDisclosure: I/we have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

It’s built itself into the world’s largest global hard asset manager, with over 80,000 employees operating out of more than 100 offices in over 30 countries on six continents. \\n\\n (Source: investor presentation) The key to its success is taking a Warren Buffett like approach to deep value investing into quality cash producing assets at opportunistic times (such as during recessions when asset prices are cheap). It then operates those assets, collecting steady and long-term contracted cash flow, improves them, and eventually sells them for large profits, realizing annualized returns on invested capital ranging from 12% to 20% (official goal is 7% to 20% but Brookfield has a great track record of under promising and over delivering).\\n Brookfield’s empire is a complex network of limited partnerships (like BPY, BIP, and BEP), as well as private equity funds. \\n\\n (Source: investor presentation) The LPs raise money from debt markets and retail investors attracted to safe and fast-growing distributions. These LPs pay BAM an asset management fee (usually 1.25% of AUM), an incentive fee (based on market cap growth), and incentive distribution rights capped at 25% of distribution growth above a certain quarterly rate. In addition, BAM directly owns between 30% and 68% of its LP’s common units meaning that it also benefits from the payouts of its LPs which are backed by highly regulated or long-term contracted (and recession resistant) cash flow. \\n\\n (Source: investor presentation) The amount of money retail investors are funneling into LPs like what Brookfield runs has been growing like a weed and is expected to hit $130 trillion by 2030. \\n\\n (Source: investor presentation) The private equity funds raise money from institutions (like pension funds, sovereign wealth funds, and home offices for ultra high net worth individuals) looking to diversify into hard assets. Brookfield’s private equity business raised capital through 13 sources, including leading financial advisors and home offices (who manage money for billionaires).\\n Brookfield has been steadily growing its institutional client base which now numbers 530. Over the next five years, it expects to double that figure, which will mean massive growth in AUM, fees, and funds from operation or FFO. FFO is the company’s equivalent of free cash flow, is what funds the dividend and is what investors in BAM should focus on. Over the past five years, Brookfield’s institutional clients have become ever more enamored with its results. As a result, the average investment per institutional client has risen from $144 million in 2013 to $230 million today. If that trend continues (management expects it will), then doubling BAM’s institutional client base could result in over 100% AUM growth from net inflows alone (never mind asset appreciation and profits). Another reason BAM is seeing so much AUM growth (driving over 20% FFO/share growth per year) is that it continues to diversify into new investment offerings. \\n\\n (Source: investor presentation) While owning and operating hard assets has been its bread and butter since 1902 in recent years the company has moved into becoming a credit provider. For example, it’s recently launched eight infrastructure credit funds which currently have loan books of $6.3 billion. Eventually, BAM expects those eight funds alone to grow their loan books to $160 billion. It could also potentially launch new credit funds targeting commercial real estate. The company is even getting into investment banking (securitizing and listing hard assets on public stock markets). Basically, this shows that BAM is looking to become the global king of hard assets, with its finger in literally every part of infrastructure/real estate/utility pie. Over the past 12 months, Brookfield has raised a total of $20 billion from these combined approaches (LPs and institutional clients) to fund $33 billion in new investments. The $13 billion difference between these figures was asset sales, which were for terms that generated 19% annualized total returns for the company and its investors.\\n \\n\\n (Source: Investor presentation) You’ll note that BAM’s returns on investment have been rising steadily for the past decade. The reason for this is a massive increase in institutional capital looking to invest in hard assets. As more money pours into this asset class, Brookfield is able to find willing buyers to pay rich premiums to what it paid for assets many years ago. But while it’s true that investment returns on any asset class (including stocks) can be volatile, the growing popularity of hard assets is likely a long-term secular trend. \\n\\n (Source: investor presentation) Over the past decade, institutional capital flows into hard assets has doubled the total market and by 2030 the total industry size is expected to hit $100 trillion. Management believes that companies like Brookfield will be able to capture 40% of that total market, meaning that $40 trillion in AUM could be in the hands of publicly traded firms like BAM within 11 years. This means that Brookfield’s already industry-leading scale is a drop in the bucket compared to how big it could potentially grow. For example, despite being the largest and most trust hard asset manager on earth, in 2017 Brookfield’s institutional market share was about 0.5% which shows it has plenty of growth ahead of it. Why is Brookfield so confident that it can grow its market size when there are literally hundreds of global asset managers out there trying to gobble up this massive growth opportunity?\\n Because according to analyst firm McKinsey over the last year 38% of total AUM funneled into hard assets when to the top 20 firms. This is why over the past 12 months BAM’s market share rose from about 0.5% in 2017 to approximately 1.6%, showing the wide moat power of its trusted brand. In total BAM’s total addressable market by 2030 is expected to be $230 trillion, and if it can corner even a small slice of that then it’s AUM (and fees and thus FFO) are going to grow strongly for the next 11 years. But investing in BAM isn’t just about the next decade, it’s about looking out several decades into the greatest secular investing opportunity of the 21st century. According to a recent OECD report, by 2040 the world is going to need to invest nearly $100 trillion into additional infrastructure to support a fast-growing and rapidly urbanizing population. This is why so much institutional money is flowing into this asset class, to fund those necessary and economy growing projects. That investment is going to be across all manner of industries and sectors including:  Renewable energy (a $11 trillion growth opportunity) and smart grids Municipal infrastructure/smart cities telecom/data infrastructure (5G/fiber/telecom towers) Transportation (railroads, toll roads, ports) Energy transportation ($1.2 trillion in new North American midstream infrastructure needed by 2050).  Brookfield’s excellent track record of great returns and trusted brand means that it can quickly raise new institutional capital, including $6.5 billion for its flagship private equity fund in October alone. Rapid asset growth, combined with rising fees from its LP’s (currently growing about 20% annually) has allowed BAM’s revenue and cash flow per share to both grow at 17.2% over the past nine years (about triple that of the S&P 500) and 23% over the past 12 months. And with BAM management owning 20% of its shares, retail investors can be sure that the company’s incentives are deeply aligned with theirs. That management team is composed of 124 head directors, who on average have worked together for 18 years.\\n \\n\\n (Source: investor presentation) Leading this army of industry expert capital allocations is CEO Bruce Flatt, who joined Brookfield 29 years ago and has been in the top job for 15 years. Before running the entire company he ran Brookfield’s real estate division where he proved a master of acquiring quality properties from distressed owners (bankruptcy buys were his specialty). That opportunistic investing model of being the “buyer/investor of last resort” (What Buffett did with big banks in 2008) has become the basis for BAM’s entire global investment strategy and has made countless investors rich over Flatt’s tenure. So just how rich can Brookfield likely make you in the coming years? Realistically the company can likely deliver over 20% long-term total returns to anyone investing today. Dividend Profile: Modest Yield And Growth Rate BUT Excellent Market-Beating Return Potential The most important part of any income investment is the dividend profile which consists of three parts, yield, payout safety, and long-term growth potential. Combined with valuation, this is what drives total returns over time. Now Brookfield’s paltry yield of 1.6% is not anything that will excite most income investors. Nor will the company's dividend growth rate which has averaged 8% over the past two decades. BAM may be a money minting machine, but management is focused on growth of its cash flow not high or fast-growing yield (that’s what its LPs and REIT are for). This is why the company’s FFO payout ratio is a very low 14% because its cash flow has been outpacing cash flow growth for a long time. Currently, analysts expect that to continue through to a smaller extent (consensus dividend growth is 10% vs 11% FFO/share growth).\\n But while even 10% long-term dividend growth is hardly spectacular (many dividend stocks offer the same) as I’ll explain in a moment, Brookfield is still a great investment to consider.  Yield: 1.6% TTM FFO payout ratio: 14% Net Debt/EBITDA: 10.9 (industry average: 2.6) Corporate Leverage Ratio: 2.4 Interest Coverage Ratio: 1.9 Corporate Interest Coverage ratio: 9.0 Debt/Capital: 43% (industry average 54%) Corporate Debt/Capital: 19% S&P Credit Rating: A- Average Corporate Interest Rate: 4.5%  When it comes to dividend safety I consider BAM a true blue-chip 'sleep well at night' or SWAN stock. That’s because the rock bottom payout ratio means that even in a recession (and bear market for asset prices) the dividend isn’t likely to be cut, or even stop growing. The other half of the dividend safety formula is the balance sheet. At first glance, you might think me mad to say that a leverage ratio of 11 or an interest coverage ratio that’s under 2 is “safe”. However, it’s important to realize that due to the way Brookfield operates (its LPs use large amounts of non-recourse self-amortizing asset level debt) the balance sheet is actually far safer than it looks. Due to how international accounting standards work, BAM’s has to consolidate its share of the non-recourse debt of its LPs onto its own balance sheet. This makes it appear as if BAM investors are drowning in debt. In reality, the vast majority of the debt (about 80%) is linked to the assets its LPs have bought/built. Creditors can’t come after either Brookfield’s LP’s entire cash flow, much less that of the parent company. The safe use of non-recourse debt is why Brookfield enjoys an A- credit rating from S&P. The actual corporate leverage ratio is just 2.4, the actual interest coverage ratio is 9 (8 or above is safe for most corporations) and the company’s average interest rate is 4.5%. The bottom line is that BAM’s balance sheet is very strong which is why it has $11 billion in corporate liquidity available to right now and another $11 billion at the LP level to invest in great opportunities.\\n What about dividend growth potential? Well with its very low payout ratio BAM could afford to grow the payout at 15% to 20% for many years. But even if it merely grows at the 10% analysts expect income investors are going to be thrilled for other reasons. \\n\\n (Source: investor presentation) That’s because the fee bearing capital that is the main driver of its FFO is expected to double over the next five years. Brookfield is usually conservative with its growth guidance which is why it typically exceeds its long-term targets by substantial margins. With fee capital expected to grow at 14%, I think analyst estimates of just 11% FFO/share growth are probably overly conservative. \\n\\n (Source: investor presentation) That’s because the company expects 14% growth in fee capital to translate into at least 18% growth in fee earnings (and thus likely FFO/share). This faster rate of growth is why Brookfield is forecasting that BAM investors could enjoy 24% total returns over the next five years. \\n\\n (Source: investor presentation) How realistic is that forecast? Well, I think it might very well be reasonable. That’s because when you combine fast cash flow growth (about 18% annually) along with the current yield and the company’s discount to fair value, that’s roughly what my long-term valuation adjusted total return model says.\\n  Price/FFO: 8.6 20-year average P/FCF: 11.5 Potential Discount to fair value: 25% Potential Upside To Fair Value: 34% 10-Year Valuation Boost (OTCPK:CAGR): 3.0% Potential 10-Year Total Return: (yield + long-term FCF growth + valuation boost): 22.6% Long-Term Total Return (factoring out long-term valuation mean reversion): 19.6%  Today BAM is trading for just 8.6 times FFO, far below its 20 year average of 11.5. That agrees with management own estimate that share are 25% undervalued (based on adjusted net asset value incorporating the carried interest it enjoys as an asset manager). That 25% undervaluation means that investors are likely to experience a 3% annualized total return boost over 10 years as shares revert back to their historical cash multiple. Then add that to the Gordon Dividend Growth Model (Brookfield’s official total return model for all its LPs) of yield + long-term cash flow growth and you get: 1.6% + 18% + 3% = 22.6%. That’s roughly in line with management’s total return forecast and keep in mind that my model assumes it takes 10 years for BAM’s P/FFO to return to its historical norm. If it takes less time then my and management’s return forecasts align even closer. So with the Berkshire of global hard assets trading at a steep discount to fair value, it’s a fantastic buy for all investors, right? Well only if you’re comfortable with its risk profile. Risks To Consider No company is risk-free and there are three things to consider before investing in BAM. First, because it’s a Canadian company (it pays dividends in US dollars) US investors face a 15% withholding tax on their dividends in taxable accounts (but not IRAs or 401Ks). Thanks to the tax treaty we have with Canada the IRS allows Americans to deduct this from their US tax bills, effectively neutralizing the withholding. However, you still have to file the paperwork to get that credit and just $300/$600 per individual/couple in total withholdings (across all foreign companies in all your portfolios) can be claimed with the standard 1040 tax form. For figures above this, the more complex form 1116 is required.\\n As for company risk, the biggest thing to realize about BAM is that this is a highly complex beast. BAM’s involvement in so many different investing areas and products means that there is a chance that management oversteps its expertise and goes outside its circle of competence. Now that’s not to say that BAM is going to blow itself up with its new credit funds, and face an existential threat to its survival ala the Financial Crisis. However, there is a risk that management might end up being forced to take larger losses than are currently baked into its models, which could end up hurting its FFO/share (though probably not enough to threaten the dividend). Finally, I have to point out that BAM is a highly volatile stock. Over the last 10 years, it’s been about 31% more volatile than the S&P 500. However, in the short-term, its volatility can spike, including its 1-year beta soaring to almost three during the Financial Crisis (when anything connected to finance took a swan dive). Another credit meltdown is highly unlikely which means BAM isn’t likely to fall 72% as it did during the Great Recession (market fell 57%). But my point is that BAM’s blue-chip SWAN stock status only pertains to the safety of the dividend and the quality of the company. It does not imply that BAM (or any SWAN stock for that matter) will avoid large paper losses during a market downturn (BAM’s peak decline during this bear market has been 18.1% so far). Bottom Line: You’ve Seen The Rest, Now Invest In The Best While Brookfield Asset Management’s relatively paltry yield and unexciting long-term dividend growth rate might make it appear a lackluster income growth stock, I still consider it a fantastic addition to any dividend growth portfolio. In fact, Dividend Sensei is soon planning on adding the Berkshire of global hard asset management to his new Deep Value Dividend Growth Portfolio. That’s because, while BAM is far from the highest-yielding asset manager you can buy today, it is likely trading at a steep discount to fair value. And under the Buffett mantra that “it’s better to buy a wonderful company at a fair price than a fair company at a wonderful price” I eagerly recommend Brookfield Asset Management anytime it’s trading at fair value or better.\\n That’s because not only is BAM undoubtedly a wonderful company but as the head of the mighty Brookfield global empire, it’s the simplest way for investors to cash in on a decades-long, $100+ trillion growth opportunity in global real estate, infrastructure, and renewable energy. Not just does BAM have the longest and largest growth runway I’ve ever seen for any company, but with its proven master capital allocators finding the best long-term investment opportunities around the globe, this dividend growth stock is a “legend of tomorrow”. One that is likely to deliver high double-digit total returns not just for the next few years, but for many decades to come (and likely over 20% total returns over the next five years). This makes Brookfield as close to a “buy and hold forever” stock as you can find on Wall Street, and a very strong buy during this bear market.

At the point of retiring, this portfolio will transition into a safer distribution yield-based portfolio which is targeted to yield 4% or 5% to cover my daily expenses. Note: This is meant for a 5 to 7-year portfolio, and I hence take a longer-term approach to stock-picking and selection. There is a need for some active management in terms of selection and market timing. I am not assuming I am confident or more intelligent in being able to beat the market, but I am willing to take more risks to generate the returns while I continue to have a stable job supplemented by a high savings rate. With growth in mind, I started my first FIRE Building Portfolio with positions initiated in November. December has been volatile and this impacted my portfolio significantly with Amarin Corp. (AMRN) which I had held for 5 years, and Facebook (FB) incurring losses while short positions in Caterpillar Inc. (CAT) and Tiffany & Co. (TIF) helping to buffer the loss. I continue to keep most of my portfolio in short term peer-to-peer lending as it has given me pretty good returns. (note: some readers have asked what platform I use and also warned me of the risks of P2P lending and I hope to cover this in detail as well) In December, I have been shoring up cash because of the choppy market. I have in total $428,000 in this portfolio and 24% is held in cash, 50% in P2P lending under 12 months, 14% in traded endowments mostly over 5 years to maturity. The remaining 12% is in stocks, and that is mostly concentrated in Amarin Corp. Hence, over the duration of 2019, I am looking to increase my exposure to stocks and to deploy some cash to get more leverage if there is a steep market correction through secured overdraft loans or share financing.\\n Objectives of the Portfolio Please do read this to understand my context of building the screen, but I also welcome feedback and opinions about building this nest egg because at the moment, I have decided, while still young, to incur more risks and to hunt for growth, in what I call a FIRE Building Portfolio. Note: While I am able to continue generating income through employment and am confident I can and want to take on more risks to accelerate the retirement plan. However, others who are more patient and more risk averse should consider this article only as an alternate viewpoint to consider. Do your own homework.

I have recovered my bulk of my investment cost having sold 1,000 shares at $14.88, and some of that cash was withdrawn from the brokerage into my cash position. From the recent trades made, I have not fully allocated my portfolio into shares due to the choppy markets. As a result, I have started to add new positions to protect from the risk of a weak 2019. However, I am still looking to invest into growth and am keen on Qualcomm (QCOM) and Magna International (MGA), both of which I had previously written on but had not initiated positions yet. For my shorts, the general theme is to short consumer discretionary items, and I have done well on Caterpillar (CAT) and Tiffany (TIF) in particular. I continue to see both companies coming off considerably in 2019 and intend to cover them in detail soon on Seeking Alpha. Yoma Strategic (OTCPK:YMAIF) is a position that I took after looking at the real estate market in Myanmar and also because the country does not seem to have gotten its act together. My article on Yoma can be read here. Newly Initiated Positions Long Facebook (FB) via call option was an idea I wrote about on Seeking Alpha recently, and I executed on the trade just before FB tanked from $140 to $120. Thankfully, I have not fully invested and am continually monitoring to enter the market for more. Caveat is there is continued growth overall and a stabilizing USA and European daily active user despite boycotts and account closures. From its 52-week peak at over $220, the stock has declined 45%, while operations have continued to generate cash, and there has been no material drop in daily active users (\"DAU\") or monthly active users (\"MAU\"). In fact, these figures have continued to grow. Analyst estimates an average price target for next year of $189.76. With Dec. 2019 Call Options based on strike price at $160, the cost of $14.50 works out to be a total of $174.50. Potential upside of 109%.\\n Assuming the lower end EPS estimate of $6.03 and 19x PE, the price would trade at about $114. My estimate for the downside is about $132. Hence, the risk in this trade is a total loss on this trade. Stable growth in earnings remains my base case, and I would be long FB at this stage, but since it is cheaper to go long via options, and the volatility of this stock has been pretty large, I figured going into a 1-year call option would be an alternative exposure for me. I previously wrote that I would review this strategy if FB trades near $114, representing a nearly 50% decline from its $220 peak and buy the stock outright if it does trade that low. However, taking a look at the options I have, the price just looks pretty tempting again. \\n\\n Source: my brokerage account The Dec. 2019 call option last traded at $20.25, which works out to be at a total cost of $145. My base case is $132, and if the price goes below my base case, that would be time to pull the trigger on FB. Gold Options I recently bought a Dec. 2019 call option on the XAUUSD to hedge against a possible political and economic conflict between China and the USA or in an event EU does not work out well. This is a small position and does not impact the portfolio by much. Potential Investments - QCOM and MGA I did not set out to short companies over the short term, but I did it as I looked and found some companies to be worthwhile investments which turned out otherwise. I am still looking to go long on companies I find have growth potential over a 7 to 8 year horizon. Hence, I am looking at investing in QCOM and MGA for the following reasons: 1. Qualcomm is high on my shortlist right now. My potential 7% dividend yield play has now shot up further because I wrote at a time when QCOM was $55. It has traded slightly lower at $53.65, and I my base case has not changed. I believe there is an opportunity to pick up QCOM at or near its 52-week low of $48, which brings the yield potential to 8%. Extremely solid!\\n For those who did not have a chance to read the article, my 2019 base case is that QCOM would likely generate adequate free cash flows to cover interest expense of $768 million (based on 2018 figure) and buy back $11 billion worth of shares with debt (roughly $1.5 billion in interest expense in 2019 factored in). This would leave cash available for dividends to be roughly the same or slightly lower than 2018. After all that financial engineering, I reckon by September 2019, QCOM would have a market cap reduced by about 1/3, at $45 billion and a possible ability to maintain dividends of $3.2 to $3.4 billion. The upside is someone purchases QCOM and if there is a favorable settlement with Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL). 2. Magna International is a stock I wrote about that just keeps getting cheaper. Trading at 6.6x PE and a dividend yield of 3%, this automobile component manufacturer has been dragged by the consumer discretionary theme as demand for cars has declined/stagnated. Magna has declined 10% since I wrote about the stock, and nothing material has changed my view. \\n\\n Source: Statista.com Yes, vehicle sales have declined, and the trend is more acute in China. However, MGA has qualities that would allow the company to ride through the storm. While the industry has lagged, Magna picked up +7% sales and +14% EPS growth. The historical dividend record is strong as well, growing at 14% in the past 5 years, and on top of that, Magna is buying back shares. \\n\\n\\n Source: MGA Company filings The NTA (NAV adjusted for intangibles and goodwill of $2.43 billion) is $24.24 billion compared to a $14.7 billion market cap - 0.6x tangible book value. MGA also has cash to repurchase shares, and its cash flow remains strong. Having assumed all else remains similar to 2018, my base case is that MGA grows EPS by 3% just through a $500 million share repurchase. Management shared that they expect $6b of free cash flow between 2018 and 2020, and I reckon the share buyback will continue or increase to about $1 billion annually instead. Given the share price correction, I see this as a stable cash generating business with over 20% upside even as a cyclical stock. However, we might see $30 before we hit a bottom, given that car manufacturers are all suffering. No harm waiting this out to initiate a position closer at those levels. I estimate $30 which is in the region of 5x earnings just because the manufacturers are trading at those valuations or lower. Conclusion Going forward, while I still look to deploy more cash towards investing in stocks, I will be tracking Facebook\\'s active user and overall traffic growth because this is a position I either decide to cut loss or add more depending on whether anything significant occurs. I will also be looking at opportunities to buy into MGA and QCOM. However, there have been some consumer discretionary stocks that I have come across that are quite pricey, and I do keep an open mind towards shorting such stocks. I am also looking to go long in markets like Russia, Hong Kong and Japan through ETFs because I find there is quite good value in those countries.\\nDisclosure: I/we have no positions in any stocks mentioned, but may initiate a long position in QCOM, MGA over the next 72 hours.

(GCO)'], 'time': '2018-12-28T13:50:30Z', 'author': 'Detroit Bear', 'about': ['<span id=\"about_primary_stocks\"><a href=\"/symbol/GCO\" title=\"Genesco Inc.\" sasource=\"article_primary_about\">Genesco Inc. (GCO)</a></span>'], 'theme': ['<div class=\"a-themes\"></div>'], 'summary': ['Genesco finally unloaded Lids for ~$100 million and will use the proceeds to buy back stock.Journeys and J&M are executing well, but Schuh remains a drag on operating income growth.Overall, execution at the company looks strong and buybacks could add $0.40 of EPS.Still, shares look roughly fairly valued at current prices.'], 'article': [\"Shares of Genesco (GCO) have outperformed several retail competitors over the past month with the stock flat as opposed to down 10%. The company posted solid Q3 earnings and finally sold Lids. I think the Lids sale could ultimately add as much as 40 cents of EPS, and the core business is performing fairly well. That said, shares look fairly priced at current levels. Let's take a look at the implication of the Lids sale, as well as the performance of the rest of the business. Lids Nets $100 Million The Lids sale process took much longer than anticipated, but it has finally culminated in a sale to competitor Fanzz with a minority investment from Fanatics for a total sale price of about $100 million. After taxes and fees, it looks like the sale will net Genesco around $94 million. I think the haul is ultimately somewhat disappointing, but it removes Genesco's comp headwind and allows the company to focus on its core businesses. Genesco will use the proceeds to repurchase stock. At current prices, this would theoretically reduce the share count by 11% and boost earnings per share by about 40 cents. Overall, I think management is making the right choice on both fronts. For one, the Lids business is in decline, and though it can be profitable at a mid-cycle margin, the business is more structurally challenged than it ever has been. Lids got out before it was too late. Secondly, I like the decision to repurchase stock, though I hope management goes about it in a discerning way, attempting to repurchase shares with an eye toward valuation. Given the volatility in retail, I also would not be opposed to keeping some dry powder on the balance sheet in case any other concept starts to struggle.\\n Performance Robust Across the Board Net sales in Q3 were down 1% y/y to $713 million due to a calendar shift. Importantly, comps were up 4% y/y stacking on a 1% gain in Q3'18, resulting in a 5% consolidated two-year stack comp trend. This comp places Genesco in a solid position. Most impressive, in my view, was the strength of the footwear business. Journeys' comp sales were up 9% y/y on top of a 4% gain in the year prior quarter, reflecting the strength of the boot business as well as the segment's ability to identify teen trends. Management noted that the business was positive against strong Q4 comps through November, suggesting the trend will continue for at least another quarter. Journeys' inventory was down 5% y/y, suggesting that Q4 should also be strong from a margin perspective. Johnston & Murphy was the other standout, with comps up 10% y/y on top of a weak 1% decline in Q3'18. J&M has pivoted to more of a lifestyle brand in recent quarters, and I think some of the product is uniquely positioned to capture market share. The company made some investments in marketing through a new catalog and suffered from some wholesale issues, which ultimately resulted in a total revenue growth rate of 7.6% and an operating income margin that declined by 60 basis points y/y. J&M's profitability and revenue growth year-to-date remain healthy, so I am not particularly concerned. Inventory growth lagged sales growth at 7%, and I anticipate increasing merchandise margin going forward. Contrary to J&M and Journeys, Schuh remains challenged. Comps were down 4% y/y, making the two-year stacked trend flat. Total sales were down nearly 6% y/y to $95.6 million, and operating income fell sharply, down 40% y/y to $4.2 million. Operating margin for the segment was down 260 basis points y/y to 4.4% of sales, and the only positive was an 8% decline in inventory. Management's commentary on the business continues to be negative, with heavy discounting weighing on gross margin, and scarcity models pursued by key vendors limiting the access to product that customers actually want. Nevertheless, one of the strengths of the Genesco model is diversification, and the other segments are performing relatively well at the moment, mitigating some of the poor performance.\\n In total, Genesco delivered a flat gross margin at 49.5% of sales, while SG&A deleveraged by just 20 basis points in spite of a tough calendar shift that left total sales growth negative. Excluding $9 million in asset impairments, Genesco would have delivered a 1.4% adjusted operating margin, down just 20 basis points y/y. Inventory is in great shape, down 4.5% y/y, and the company will be sitting on roughly $150 million in cash once the Lids deal closes. Solid Execution But Fairly Valued Overall, I think it is evident that Genesco is executing relatively well, especially in the US. Schuh looks challenged, but much of the weakness can be attributable to factors out of Genesco's control. The business could certainly rebound in the next few quarters, and I would not be surprised. For FY19, Genesco is guiding to positive comps of 2-3% and earnings per share of $3.10-3.40. At current prices, the top-end of the EPS range would be 12.7x earnings, which is not particularly expensive, nor is it cheap relative to many retailers that are now trading at 8-10x earnings. Over the next few quarters, Genesco could buy back as much as $100 million in stock, which would reduce the share count by 11-12% and add around $0.40 per share in earnings. This would reduce the multiple to 11.4x earnings, assuming no growth in operating income. The valuation, in my view, is roughly fair. Shares are not egregiously expensive, but I would not put capital to work in the stock at current prices.\\nDisclosure: I/we have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

XOM is actually down 14% over the past 10 years. In comparison, Chevron (CVX) has done somewhat better than Exxon and is up 43% over the past 10 years. Still, even Chevron pales in comparison with the S&P 500. This is hard for many investors to figure out given the fact that the price of WTI has been more than $80/bbl for much of the past 10 years and as high as $130/bbl: \\n\\nSource: MacroTrends\\n So What Gives? The problem is that shale technology - horizontal drilling and fracking - is readily reproducible. Not only that, but there are multiple expansive shale plays in America: The Marcellus, Utica, Bakken, Eagle Ford, Niobrara, Permian, Haynesville, and the SCOOP/STACK - just to name some of the more notable. Gone are the days when companies like Exxon Mobil, Chevron, Unocal, and Atlantic Richfield ruled the roost. It used to be that only these big companies that had the technology and the deep pockets to produce large quantities of oil and gas (in places like the Gulf of Mexico and Alaska). Today, there are dozens and dozens of companies that are producing meaningful quantities of shale oil and gas all over the lower 48. Just take a look at the top 10 natural gas producers in August of this year: \\n\\nSource: Natural Gas Supply Association Other than Exxon and BP (NYSE:BP), many of these top-10 producers were barely known 10 years ago and, even if they were, did not produce anywhere near the gas they are producing today. The same with goes with US oil production. Sure, companies like Chevron, Exxon, ConocoPhillips (COP) and Occidental Petroleum (OXY) are still among the largest producers of oil in the United States. However, look at the list of companies below that were barely on the radar screen 10 years ago and that are producing significant quantities of shale oil (and gas) production:   Company Q3 Oil & Gas Production   EOG Resources (EOG) 749,000 boe/d   Anadarko Petroleum (APC) 682,000 boe/d   Pioneer Resources (PXD) 321,000 boe/d   Devon (DVN) 522,000 boe/d   Marathon Oil (MRO) 419,000 boe/d   Diamondback Energy (FANG) 220,000 boe/d *   TOTAL 2.9 million boe/d   Source: Q3 EPS Reports; * Adjusted for FANG Takeover of Energen\\n As of Q3, the six companies shown above - most of whom were very small players 10 years ago - now produce the roughly the equivalent of another Chevron - 2.9 million boe/d. And note that this list is by no means complete ... there are dozens of other companies out there producing close to, or more than, 100,000 boe/d today. The point is, lower 48 shale oil production is booming today and has been growing steadily since horizontal drilling and fracking technology first burst onto the scene: \\n\\nSource: EIA In the most recent weekly report, US production was 11.6 million bpd - more than double of the production of 2009. The chart for natural gas production doesn\\'t look a lot different. Meantime, the technology keeps improving: Multi-pad drilling and better completion techniques and recipes continue to reduce costs and increase productivity. Many producers\\' biggest growth constraint is adequate pipeline takeaway capacity! Thank God for that. Bottom Line The bottom line here is that the energy sector in the U.S. is now a no-moat investment proposition. That is, the barriers to compete are very less. It\\'s not even a moat - it\\'s a puddle that can be stepped over. The technology is readily available, the majors cannot possibly buy up all the land, and money is still relatively easy to raise. What this all means, of course, is lower prices. Note that the days of $10-plus Henry Hub gas appears to be over, at least for the foreseeable future. In fact, Henry Hub hasn\\'t even been above $6 since 2009: \\n\\nSource: MacroTrends\\n Also note the Wall Street Journal reports that as producers concentrate on oil production, associated natural gas production is so high it is overwhelming pipeline infrastructure and is sometimes given away for free in places like the Permian Basin. Meanwhile, up north in Canada, the energy patch is a complete disaster. Over production of both oil sands crude and natural gas have overwhelmed the pipeline infrastructure and just cratered prices. Recently, oil sands CEOs called in the government to help sort out the WCS price mess by mandating production cuts. We\\'ll see how that works and how rail transport affects pricing for oil sands crude. Meantime, the natural gas price in Western Canada is still suffering. And don\\'t tell me OPEC no longer has power. OPEC plus Russia can directly determine the cash flow generation of US shale producers. Granted, it\\'s in OPEC\\'s and Russia\\'s interest to have high oil prices. But they too are producers scrapping for market share. Their production decisions matter here in the U.S. Just recently, note the role OPEC politics plays as on the price of oil: Trump announced the US would put sanctions on Iranian oil exports and pleaded with Saudi Arabia to raise production to mitigate the price impact. Then, the Trump administration reversed itself and announced waivers for Iran\\'s top eight customers. That\\'s the primary factor that Brent and WTI are currently trading at $52.50 and $45/bbl, respectively: Over-production. The other factor, or course, is a concern of reduced global oil demand because of the current U.S./China trade war and what it could do to the global economy going forward. Bottom line: In the shale oil environment, we can depend on one thing: Volatility. Oil prices will be volatile as US energy producers elbow their way into a global market in which the U.S. used to be a net importer of petroleum products. The U.S. is now a net exporter. This has changed everything for global energy markets. Obviously, an energy company needs smart and informed management that\\'s quick on its feet and can allocate capital appropriately.\\n What Should Energy Investors Do? In my opinion, energy investors need to be more selective than ever before. For a real world case, note that Exxon\\'s stock price is today below where it was 10 years ago: \\n\\nSource: Yahoo Finance And before Exxon shareholders point out the recent sell-off, note that Exxon was below where it was 10 years ago even before the sell-off. My point here is not to bash Exxon, but for investors to realize that even buying the biggest producers with the best balance sheet does not guarantee success. What energy investors need to be looking for is the following:  Excellent source rock (i.e. a low-cost, low breakeven, resource base). Strong balance sheet - investment grade preferred. Smart and flexible shareholder oriented management. \"Special\" assets.  If you don\\'t have all of these, you will likely not succeed in the volatile and generally \"lower-for-longer\" oil and gas price environment I see lasting for many years to come. What Exxon primarily lacks is No. 3 - a flexible and shareholder-friendly management team. Management appears to be focused on growing Exxon just for the sake of getting bigger, regardless of whether or not shareholders will get a decent total return (stock price appreciation plus dividend yield) because of it. While Exxon does pay a decent dividend, that\\'s pretty much all investors have to show over the past decade. Recently, the new Exxon CEO appears to be continuing on much as before. I say this because year-over-year capital spending at Exxon will take another significant jump next year as we head into another low-price environment: \\n\\nSource: 2018 Investor Update\\n Note the majority of increase is in Exxon\\'s upstream segment (i.e. just more production...). I certainly agree with Exxon\\'s continued and even accelerated investments to bring the massive 5 billion bbl (and growing) Guyana resource to market. But I have issues with some of the other growth initiatives. In my mind, Exxon should have allocated more capital back to shareholders and reward them for the past decade that resulted in a relative flat total return. Apparently, Exxon is forging into a very different future with the very same \"strategy\" it has had over the past decade. I doubt the outcome will be much different. (Note: I plan to next write a Seeking Alpha article on Exxon to specifically address this issue - please keep an eye out for it). Contrast Exxon with a company like ConocoPhillips, whose management \"gets it.\" Back in 2016, I wrote an article (see COP Unveils A Flexible, Analytics-Driven, Scenario-Based Cash Allocation Strategy) showing what management\\'s strategy was with respect to the new \"shale era.\" Basically, it\\'s a flexible allocation model that puts a priority on free cash flow and total shareholder returns over various oil & gas price cycles. As a result, COP management said earlier this year (when the oil price was much higher) that they would not \"chase the price of oil.\" Good call given what has unfolded. With this strategy in place, COP\\'s 2019 capital budget if flat year-over-year. However, due to the company\\'s other strategy (asset sales, debt reduction, a general portfolio \"high grading\"), the same capital budget as last year is expected to grow production 8% on a per debt-adjusted share basis. This, in addition to the company being FCF positive at $40/bbl, is what investors want to see in an energy company. But it all starts with COP\\'s management team being focused on total returns to shareholders. And this is not new at COP. Remember, COP spun off the downstream business into Phillips 66 (PSX) back in 2012. Phillips 66 then formed an MLP, Phillips 66 Partners (PSXP), to monetize midstream assets. As a result, over the past decade, COP has run rings about its bigger peers Exxon and Chevron in terms of total returns. Not even close. Because it all starts with management being focused on total returns to shareholders - not simply growing production or revenue. It\\'s all about generating and growing free cash flow and allocating that to shareholders (not just the executive management team).\\n A focus on shareholder returns led COP to sell the majority of its high-cost oil sands production and the majority of its lower 48 dry gas production. Before those asset sales, COP\\'s full-year 2016 production was 1.567 million boe/d. The most recent quarter\\'s production was 1.224 million boe/d, or a decline of ~350,000 boe/d over the past couple of years. Yet during that same time period, the stock went from the low $40s to nearly $80 before the recent sell-off began. Why? Because the company high graded its production profile, paid down debt to an investment grade level, and focused on generating free cash flow. As a result, COP generated $1.9 billion of free cash flow in Q3 and is now breakeven at $40/bbl WTI. This is a lesson that many energy companies need to learn, but that most have not. COP \"gets it\", and as a result they \"shrank to grow.\" While production may have dropped significantly, shareholder returns went up significantly. And that\\'s what matters: How free cash flow generation is allocated so that shareholders get a decent return. This is a lesson Exxon badly needs to take note of. Lastly, investors need to take a look at executive pay packages. Many companies reward CEOs for simply growing production instead of what they should be rewarded for: An appreciating stock price and/or increasing per share free cash flow generation. So, you want to stick with companies that have a pretty clear line of sight to free cash flow generation with \"special assets.\" COP has at least two: Alaska and the Eagle Ford. Both have long runways for growth and generate excellent returns. In Alaska, COP has made some solid recent discoveries and may have \"cracked the code\" with their seismic technology. Conoco has yet to explore the majority of their Alaska leasehold. \\n\\nBetter still - ConocoPhillips owns 29.2% of the Trans-Alaska Pipeline (\"TAPS\") that transports its northern Alaskan production to market. That means the company is making money coming and going. And the majority of Alaskan crude is sold at Brent-based pricing.\\n Summary and Conclusion Investors need to view the U.S. energy production sector as one that offers a relatively \"no moat\" proposition. Long gone are the days when a handful of companies controlled production of oil and gas with strong pricing. There are literally dozens and dozens of companies that are able to grow oil and gas production - some quite dramatically - in today\\'s \"shale era\". And all this production has led to low oil and gas pricing power. As a result, investors need to look for the following:  Excellent source rock (i.e. a low-cost, low breakeven, resource base). Strong balance sheet - investment grade preferred. Smart and flexible shareholder oriented management. \"Special\" assets.  If a company doesn\\'t have all of these, you may be wasting your time. I would especially avoid those highly-levered companies that don\\'t even have a \"special asset\" they can depend on to pull them through a low-price scenario that last six months (or more). I think ConocoPhillips is one company that checks all the boxes and whose management has proven it has the right strategy in place to deal with the volatile price environment prevalent in the era of shale oil and gas. Note that COP is one of the few energy companies that is still up year to date after the recent selloff: \\n\\nSource: Yahoo Finance\\nDisclosure: I am/we are long COP, CVX, XOM, PSX, PSXP.

These currently include slowing global economic growth, Fed policy, political uncertainty, trade issues, Brexit, commodity prices, and regional military conflicts.

Stocks are on sale, valuations are cheaper, and prospective long-term returns have improved. For traders, the outlook is much less certain. While a near-term bounce is likely, it may not hold if history is a guide.” (Charlie Bilello) Italy “Debt ‘must be kept under surveillance, but it isn't so scary,’ Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte said at his year-end press conference in Rome. ‘Italy's economic fundamentals are very solid.’ He also reaffirmed confidence in his coalition's controversial economic policies following a weeks-long standoff with the EU, as the government races against the clock to pass its 2019 budget law before Dec. 31.” (Wall Street Breakfast) Thought For The Day Long before the term “fake news” had been coined, I used to challenge my son when he was a little kid (he’s now 20) reading my Wall Street Journal with a popsicle slung in his mouth to choose the most obviously distorted news report of the day. Journalistic conventions of reporting are just that – conventions, but they’re not always the same thing as the truth, and sometimes they are its opposite. Or sometimes it’s not the journalists but those they are quoting who are untruthful. In any event, I wanted him to learn to think critically about what he read.\\n So as I read the item on Wall Street Breakfast (quoted above), the story about Italy’s prime minister defending his country’s economy was today’s easy pickings. Italy’s economic fundamentals are actually quite problematic, which is actually why its people elected a new government seeking to make significant economic reforms. But that government hasn’t logged even a year of governance yet, and so Italy remains, as it has now been for a long time, the European country with the highest debt besides Greece. Investors may recall that Greece’s problems nearly toppled the EU a few years ago. If Italy’s problems continue to mount, its size and importance will topple Europe. Italy’s new government has been at loggerheads with the EU over its budget deficit and debt levels. I actually sympathize more with Italy, because the EU’s conservative approach to finance – in a word, austerity – seeks to contain rather than end the problem, whereas Italy’s leaders (some at least) are looking to reform the economy in order to trigger growth again. Frankly, that’s the only way to do it. No one should expect the economic situation to improve without a return to capitalism. The U.S. economy got a huge economic boost from the 2017 tax cuts, and putting more money in Italians’ pockets could similarly help. Spending restraint is also needed (in the U.S. as well). Neither of those elements are yet in place. Until they are, Italy’s economic fundamentals are rather sickly. You needn’t look at all the usual tables and charts. The quickest, meaningful snapshot can be seen in the World Bank’s Ease Of Doing Business rankings, on which Italy comes in at 51 overall, including a ranking of 112 for getting credit and 111 for enforcing contracts. Ultimately, if people can’t access capital and feel secure about their business dealings, jobs will not be created and the economy will not grow. The U.S., incidentally, ranks No. 9 on that list. Every self-respecting, upwardly mobile nation should aspire to be on its Top 5.\\n Italy is a large and important nation, with every reason to prosper, if only its government will remove the many obstacles. Prime Minister Conte may turn out to be the one who does this, but until he’s chalked up some real accomplishments, his blustery words will be void of meaning. -- Please share your thoughts in our comments section.

There are several benefits for airlines in utilising operating leases compared with owning the aircrafts outright. The key advantage is that an airline does not need to recognise the asset (aircraft) and associated liability (e.g. finance lease) on its balance sheet. Secondly, there may be tax advantages in the form of tax deductions for operating lease payments (compared with depreciation and interest costs otherwise claimed), and generally, these cross-border leases are also not subject to withholding taxes either. The effective tax rate for the lessors is also quite low (~10-15%), so the economics on a post-tax basis are quite efficient. Finally, the airline does not carry the residual value risk of the aircraft (the residual price of aircrafts can fluctuate widely depending on market conditions and specific aircraft model). AER is by far the largest independent player in the industry and thus benefits from scale:  Volume discounts on new aircrafts and access to best-in-class market intelligence. Deep bench and experienced aviation experts team. Lower cost of funds (the only leasing company whose unsecured bonds have been rated investment-grade) and broad relationships with many banks and broader investment community. Access to effectively all airlines and agility in the placement and re-marketing of aircrafts (new orders as well as old aircrafts). As a case in point, currently, over 90% of aircraft deliveries through 2020 have been leased already as highlighted in the company\\'s Q3 2018 earnings deck. \\n So what are the risks in the business model? The aviation industry is extremely cyclical and capital intensive. On the asset side, AER is predominantly exposed to credit risk on airlines\\' clients as well as \"metal risk\" (i.e. residual value or market value of aircrafts). The latter may manifest as an asset impairment that can be assessed at any time during the lease period or residual value risks (carrying value in its books is less than market value). In recent years, AER has been recording net gains on asset sales - but I wouldn\\'t necessarily count on this continuing in a more adverse environment. The credit and metal risks are highly correlated - if and when the aviation industry goes south for any reason (e.g. recession, high oil price), demand for aircrafts will hit bottom at roughly the same time as weaker airlines are more likely to default on their lease obligations. When an airline defaults on its lease commitments, AerCap will typically repossess the aircraft and look to redeploy to alternative airlines under a new lease or sell the aircraft. To protect itself, AerCap collects upfront (especially from weaker credit clients) a maintenance reserve which is essentially a guarantee payment over and above the lease payments commitments. To date, AerCap has managed defaults extremely well with approximately 1% run rate for impairments over the last decade. However, make no mistake about this - if and when the aviation industry will face real and sustained turbulence, the losses will likely be much more meaningful and material. It is worth noting that there are also specific aircraft model type risks (portfolio risk) - the market value of some models (e.g. old technology and/or less fuel efficient) can materially reduce as they fall out of favour and thus forcing owners/lessors (e.g. AerCap) to take an impairment charge or loss on disposal. Portfolio management (i.e. aircraft model mix) is a key part of proactive risk management in the aviation leasing industry. Did I mention the capital-intensive nature of the industry?\\n AerCap needs to fund upfront the purchase of aircrafts. Its forward order book to 2022 includes ~400 aircrafts. These are hard commitments and failure to complete deliveries may result in substantial costs. The annual Capex commitments are in the region of ~USD5-6b. In addition to that, there are scheduled debt maturities as well (~USD4b for the next 12 months) - so in total, AerCap needs to fund ~USD10b Capex (including debt maturities) every year (which is done mostly through debt finance). Clearly, continued access to debt finance, in its many forms, is a key risk facing the firm. Having said that, the firm\\'s approach to liability management is conservative given its large liquidity buffer. Based on current liquidity reserves and available bank facilities, it can operate for well over 12 months without the need to access additional financing. In the event of a deep and prolonged downturn in the industry, that liquidity buffer provides the firm with ample time to further calibrate its asset and liability structure to meet the new environment (e.g. sell aircrafts, joint ventures, securitisation etc.). The current liquidity position is reproduced below (Source: Company Q32018 Earnings Deck): \\n\\n Final Thoughts To reiterate, the aviation industry is cyclical and capital intensive. There are substantial risks especially if a downturn is on the horizon. Whilst I have been watching the aviation leasing industry for many years - until now, I largely remained on the sidelines. Given current valuation of AerCap, I now find the investment case compelling. I believe its diverse client base, scale, depth of expertise, and (relative to peers) conservative balance sheet and strong liquidity position will enable it to ride out a severe downturn. Being the stronger of the bunch, it should also benefit from any consolidation opportunities.\\n It is already trading at distressed levels (unjustifiably so). Note management has been buying back shares where the stock was trading in the 50s. My target price is $52 and will consider buying aggressively if share price drops further.\\nDisclosure: I/we have no positions in any stocks mentioned, but may initiate a long position in AER over the next 72 hours. I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions. I am not receiving compensation for it (other than from Seeking Alpha).

Based on the available information, our preliminary conclusion is that Green Growth\\'s bid is highly misleading and opportunistic in nature. The bid is very unlikely to succeed and we think Green Growth is simply trying to copy the playbook used by Aurora (OTC:ACB) when it acquired CanniMed in a hostile-turned-friendly deal. Management and owners of Green Growth most likely know that its bid is unlikely to succeed but are trying to use this bid to increase its profile and hopefully obtain a higher valuation for its already overvalued stock. We do not like this deal and do not believe the bid will succeed. However, we think the bid will temporarily create volatility for both stocks and Green Growth might benefit from more attention, similar to the miraculous uprise of Aurora (OTC:ACB) after its CanniMed bid. However, we would not recommend Green Growth shares due to its extremely overvalued stock and barbarian approach to M&A. \\n\\n\\n The Made-Up C$7.0 Share Price After the market closed, Green Growth (formal name is Xanthic Biopharma) announced its hostile bid for Aphria with the following details:  All-stock hostile deal  Each Aphria share will receive 1.5714 shares of Green Growth Based on Green Growth\\'s Thursday closing share price of C$4.98 on the CSE, the offer represents a value of C$7.83 which implies only a 3.4% premium over Aphria\\'s closing share price of C$7.57! Green Growth used a made-up value of C$7.0 for its shares and calculated a 45.5% premium based on this entirely fictitious share price  The press release is highly misleading because the C$7.0 quoted by Green Growth for its own shares is entirely based on internal conjecture: Green Growth expects to complete a concurrent brokered financing of C$300 million, at a price per share of C$7.00, to both illustrate confidence in the value of the consideration under the Offer and to fund the business growth of the combined entity. Green Growth expects that certain of its existing shareholders will commit to backstop the C$300 million financing concurrently with the execution of a business combination agreement with Aphria... Basically, Green Growth is saying that its shareholders believe that its stock should be worth C$7.0 per share despite the market only given it a valuation of C$4.98 per share now (and that\\'s after a mysterious ~50% run in the last two weeks). The C$300 million financing referenced in the press release is not completed and \"certain existing shareholders\" have not committed to such a transaction. There is no evidence to suggest that investors are actually willing to acquire C$300 million shares at C$7.0 per share. In any case, the financing is highly irrelevant to the hostile bid as the consideration being offered is 100% stock and none of the C$300 million will be paid to Aphria shareholders. The biggest fallacy in Green Growth\\'s bid is that it ignored the market prices of its stock and the fact that its stock had a ~50% sudden run-up in the past month. To claim that Green Growth\\'s own shareholders believe its shares are worth C$7.0 is beyond unreasonable and almost amusing.\\n \\n\\n (Source: TSX / Green Growth Share Price) The Bid Likely Implies Negative Premium When we look deeper, it seems like Green Growth\\'s bid actually carries a significant negative premium for Aphria shareholders. Given that Green Growth\\'s stock rallied ~50% in two weeks, we think it is prudent and absolutely appropriate to use volume weighted average price (\"VWAP\") in this case. Based on the table below, we can see that Green Growth\\'s bid only represented a 3% premium based on its spot price. Furthermore, the offer would actually imply a discount (the opposite of premium) of 20% and 26% to Aphria\\'s closing price using the 10-day and 20-day VWAP of Green Growth. \\n\\n More importantly, investors need to know that Green Growth\\'s stock had a huge rally in the last two weeks, rising ~50% from C$3.36 on December 14, to C$4.98 on December 27. We tried looking for explanations of the huge rally but came away believing that the recent rally was unfounded:  Dec 6: Announced that it was awarded 7 retail licenses in Nevada  Dec 11: Acquired Just Healthy which holds a medical cannabis license in Massachusetts for US$3.75 million Dec 13: Acquired second cultivation site in Nevada for US$13 million Dec 14: Acquired a dispensary in Nevada for US$15 million  With 197 million basic shares outstanding, Green Growth\\'s market capitalization increased from C$662 million on December 14 to C$981 million on December 27. With less than US$10 million revenue in 2018, the stock is easily the most overvalued U.S. cannabis stock in our entire coverage universe. On the operational side, Green Growth currently only has a single dispensary in Las Vegas and a cultivation facility in Nevada. Even after including the acquisitions discussed above, we think Green Growth remains a small single state operator with an extremely overvalued stock.\\n Conclusion Green Growth began trading on the CSE on November 13 and ended the day at C$3.05 that day. Without obvious catalysts, the stock miraculously rose ~50% to close at C$4.98 on Thursday before it announced its hostile takeover bid for Aphria. We believe that the bid has a near zero chance of success and Green Growth is likely just trying to grab investor attention and inflate share price. Green Growth is a single state operator with a single store operating in Nevada currently. Its stock is extremely overvalued and, in fact, it is the most expensive U.S. cannabis stock among our coverage universe.  Green Growth\\'s offer announcement came across as highly misleading by quoting the offer price and premiums based on a made-up internal valuation of C$7.0 when its shares actually closed at C$3.98 the same day. Using the market price, the offer only represents a value of C$7.83 and a mere 3% premium over Aphria\\'s closing price. Using 10-day and 20-day VWAP, the offer implies a negative premium of 20% and 26% discount to Aphria\\'s closing price. Ultimately, we think the bid is going to fail and fade away but Green Growth might benefit from its publicity stunt and the Aphria saga continues.\\nDisclosure: I/we have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

The company raised $75 million in a 2009 IPO in part to fund acquisitions of drugs that might be \"languishing\" at larger companies. As of the end of Q3 2018, the company still had $50 million of that cash remaining - and hadn\\'t made a major acquisition in the nine-plus years on the public markets. Meanwhile, the company continued to talk up the potential of its ifetroban compound, which underpinned four different product candidates. A Phase II dose escalation clinical study for Hepatoren, the first ifetroban product, began in 2011. Little progress has been made: enrollment for further studies even recently has taken longer than expected. Acetadote used to treat acetaminophen overdoses, lost patent protection, and revenue has collapsed as a result. Smaller additions to the portfolio have faded. Cumberland, meanwhile, continues to focus on profitability - an odd choice in the drug space, but an all-too-common strategy in the small-cap category. For smaller companies, plans to combine growth and profitability quite often wind up with neither. From a broad standpoint, the strategy here long has seemed questionable, as I wrote almost three years ago. Cumberland\\'s avowed strategy was to buy drugs lost in the proverbial shuffle at larger companies - but wasn\\'t clear that such drugs even existed, particularly since Cumberland hadn\\'t found any. The supposed potential of existing drugs and the pipeline was undercut by a refusal to spend up on R&D or sales behind it. Cumberland simply looked like an unprofitable, zero-growth small-cap - and a trading stock at best.\\n That story does seem like it might have changed, as Cumberland has closed on the acquisition of anti-infective VIBATIV from Theravance Biopharma (TBPH). Cumberland is spending $25 million (including a $5 million payment next year) for the product - about half of its cash balance. VIBATIV will become Cumberland\\'s biggest drug, and along with other efforts, could spark growth heading into 2019. So far, investors seem to like the deal. CPIX stock gained 16% on the news. Despite a rough broad market, shares have rallied from a brief 18-month low reached in late October. I\\'m far less optimistic toward the acquisition, however - and the reaction to the purchase seems to have obscured real concerns about the rest of the business. It\\'s tough to put together a short case for CPIX, given the lack of leverage on the balance sheet and problems with a near-term catalyst. But this long has been a stock that looked dangerous; it looks even more so at the moment. VIBATIV The Theravance deal seems exactly like what Cumberland has been looking for since 2009. VIBATIV is Theravance\\'s only commercialized product, but the case for TBPH rests much more on COPD treatment Revefenacin, which should be launching soon, and other compounds in its pipeline. Theravance, with a $1 billion-plus market cap, simply had better uses of its resources and focus. Meanwhile, Cumberland can sell the product - used for hospital- and ventilator-acquired bacterial pneumonia (HABP/VABP) and other skin conditions - largely through its existing acute sales force. There will be some additional spend required, per the Q3 conference call, but for the most part, Cumberland is leveraging existing assets. According to Theravance filings, VIBATIV trailing twelve-month sales are right about $18 million - which would easily make it the highest-selling drug in the Cumberland portfolio. And sales have risen 21% YTD, per the TBPH 10-Q, which would make it the fastest-growing Cumberland drug as well. Patents run through \"at least 2027\", according to Theravance filings.\\n All told, optimism toward the deal seems to make some sense. But there\\'s another, much more pessimistic, way to view the acquisition. VIBATIV has been a bit of disappointment for Theravance. Theravance cut spending behind the drug in 2017, with the 10-K specifically citing competition from generics. Sales dropped 16% last year, which the K attributed to the launch of generic daptomycin (the branded version is Merck\\'s (MRK) Cubicin). The company wrote, \"To date, VIBATIV has not been broadly accepted by physicians, patients, third-party payors, or the medical community in general,\" again due to generics (both daptomycin and vancomycin) along with branded products from Merck\\'s Sivextro, Teflaro and Dalvance from Allergan (AGN), and others. That competition seems a significant problem in the U.S. market. International growth faces challenges as well. Cumberland has never proven all that successful in selling its products overseas: international revenue was just $1.6 million in 2017, according to its 10-K, less than 4% of total sales after a 20% y/y decline. Clinigen Group (OTC:CGNGY) in 2016 returned the EU rights to Theravance, who decided not to move forward in that market on its own. Partners did sell VIBATIV in other markets (including Canada, Russia, Israel, China, and India) but total Theravance revenue outside the US was a little over $1 million (all in Europe). Theravance is making the deal to focus on bigger, better opportunities. But it\\'s also making the deal to get out from under a drug whose sales appear to have disappointed. Theravance ramped its sales force behind the drug in 2015, only to have competition lead revenues to decline almost immediately out of the gate. And a \"black box\" warning for treatment of HABP/VABP \"add[s] complexity to the marketing of VIBATIV\", as Theravance put it in the K. The 21% growth this year does help the case a bit. But Theravance probably didn\\'t put too much muscle behind sales and marketing of the drug over the last few months of ownership, and it will take Cumberland some time to ramp up its own efforts. Any disruption in the hand-off, augmented by competitive pressures, could lead sales to again decline.\\n At the least, there\\'s real risk here. And while Cumberland has a nice base to go with VIBATIV, it\\'s tough to have confidence in Cumberland\\'s biggest swing yet given real concerns about the performance of its more recent, smaller deals. The Three Big Drugs I\\'m a bit surprised by the 16% gains following the VIBATIV announcement - though I do see why investors might see the acquisition as value-added, or at least have some optimism toward the fact that the company finally is putting cash to work. The 12% jump following Q3 earnings the following week, however, is much more difficult to explain. It\\'s possible reports of an earnings beat drove the optimism, though the \\'beat\\' seems due more to a soft single-analyst estimate. Even adjusted earnings reversed to a loss from a modest profit the year before; more troubling, revenue declined 24% year-over-year. CEO A.J. Kazimi said on the Q3 call that \"we believe the quarterly financial performance was actually better than it might appear\", and the company did have a tough year-prior comparison. Oncology drug Totect (dexrazoxane) benefited in Q3 2017 from a supply shortage at competitors, which drove up sales. But even accounting for that prior-year spike, the quarter looks notably disappointing. Year-to-date revenue now is down 7.6% despite the fact that Kazimi projected full-year growth on the Q1 call, and a tough comparison is on the way in Q4. Broad performance is concerning - and the outlook isn\\'t much better. There\\'s just not much in the way of growth opportunities here. Laxative Kristalose, which drives about one-third of revenue, actually is performing reasonably well of late after trending downward for several years. Trailing twelve-month sales are roughly flat to the year-prior print. Kristalose does have some near-term potential. A co-promotion agreement with Poly Pharmaceuticals can drive sales. According to Cumberland\\'s Q3 call, the FDA has withdrawn approval for PEG (polyethylene glycol) laxatives - which could lead physicians to choose Kristalose instead. But this is not a drug with much in the way of end market growth, and it remains to be seen whether the PEG withdrawals can get the company back to the sales levels reached earlier this decade.\\n Ethyol drives over a quarter of revenue - and its outlook is similar to that of Kristalose. The product treats xerostomia (dry mouth) in cancer patients. Generic amifostine versions present competition, but with more narrow indications. Revenue is down y/y through the first nine months, but Q1 2017 saw a spike soon after a late 2016 launch, skewing the compare a bit. One issue here is royalties: Cumberland must pay Clinigen 30 to 50% of sales, and those royalties led to an unsurprising spike in SG&A expense last year. Acetadote revenue continues to decline: TTM sales are $5.4 million, a little under 15% of the total. At some point, the drug (Cumberland sells both a branded version and an authorized generic) may bottom, but any growth from these levels is highly unlikely. Combined, the three drugs drive about three-quarters of revenue - and about half pro forma for VIBATIV. The glass-half-full view is that Kristalose, Ethyol, and Acetadote can provide a solid base for Cumberland, with growth from VIBATIV and smaller products. The converse argument, however, is that those drugs aren\\'t enough yet: Adjusted EBITDA over the past four quarters is a loss of roughly $1.6 million. For that to reverse, VIBATIV needs to be a winner - and the smaller products need to start showing growth. I\\'m skeptical on all fronts. The Rest of the Portfolio Cumberland continues to talk up the promise of its Caldolor injectable ibuprofen, with Kazimi saying a \\'next-generation\\' Caldolor (improved packaging, new formulation) would help growth in 2019. But Caldolor has been a disappointment going back to the IPO: back in 2009, Kazimi had projected \"several hundred million\" dollars in sales, but TTM revenue is under $5 million. Pricing appears to be an issue, and the product clearly has lost out to Ofirmev (now owned by Mallinckrodt (MNK)). The weak sales aren\\'t for lack of effort: Cumberland has devoted substantial resources, including multiple FDA submissions looking to expand indications and gain approval for prescriptions to children. The product simply hasn\\'t gained much traction: quarterly sales are consistently clearing $1 million, but the drug likely has been unprofitable in the decade since its launch.\\n Cumberland paid $2.3 million this month to acquire full rights to triple therapy Omeclamox Pak, used to treat gastrointestinal bacteria H. pylori. The product, however, generated just $90,000 in sales in Q2, and $280K in the third quarter. Cumberland said the company is looking to contract with managed care, but here, too, price seems a stumbling block. O-Pak includes omeprazole (the generic version of branded Prilosec), along with two generic antibiotics, yet costs several hundred dollars. In early 2014, the company acquired hyponatremia (an electrolyte disorder) treatment Vaprisol from Astellas Pharma (OTCPK:ALPMY). Sales averaged nearly $1 million a quarter in the first full year: TTM revenue is about $2 million. A supply shortage led to a Q2 spike, but Q3 revenue actually was negative, with the 10-Q citing returns of expired products. The Vaprisol purchase was supposed to be an example of Cumberland picking up a forgotten drug, but it looks like Vaprisol was forgotten for good reason. And with the shortage resolved, and limited demand after that one-time spike, it\\'s tough to see much in the way of growth here. The second Clinigen drug (after Ethyol) is Totect. And the Q3 performance looks hugely concerning. As noted, sales spiked last year as competitors faced significant manufacturing shortages, reaching $2.9 million in Q3 2017. With those shortages resolved, sales have collapsed, dropping to $1.1 million in Q4 2017 and just $45 thousand in the most recent quarter. Obviously, post-shortage inventories likely are hitting near-term results. But it seems almost certain that the performance is well below management\\'s own expectations. In response to an analyst question on the Q4 2017 call, Chief Commercial Officer Marty Cearnal said that the company expected to maintain roughly one-third market share and that the Q4 sales of $1 million-plus \"were something of an indicator\" of future performance. Sales for the first three quarters combined are just $727,000. As for ifetroban, Kazimi noted \"inconclusive efficacy results\" from a recent trial of Portaban (for portal hypertension associated with liver disease). The CEO largely dismissed the results as \"not unexpected\", noting that trial was designed to evaluate safety, not efficacy. But Kazimi also said that the company would await the results of other Phase II studies - where, again, enrollment is taking longer than expected - before moving forward. What is now a seven-year process seems likely to take much more time. Meanwhile, the lack of movement belies the long-running optimism toward the compound, which was originally discarded by Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY) and donated to Vanderbilt University before being picked up through Cumberland\\'s partnership with the school.\\n The other cited 2019 growth driver is what will be known as RediTrex, an injectable methotrexate arthritis treatment. Cumberland picked up the exclusive U.S. rights from Nordic Group for 180K shares of stock in late 2016. Cearnal said on the Q2 call that the company expects $30 to $50 million in revenue - but why that is isn\\'t clear. Antares Pharma\\'s (ATRS) OTREXUP has generated TTM sales of about $16.6 million. Revenues are down this year and about flat excluding a year-prior accounting change. The ATRS 10-Q attributes the YTD decline (including a sharp drop in Q3) to increased rebates and sales allowances, which have offset unit growth. Does the entrance of another product from Cumberland improve that pricing situation? And why, when Cumberland has struggled in so many competitive markets (notably with Caldolor and now, apparently Totect) is it going to win in this one? The Bear (Short?) Case Looking at Cumberland on a product-by-product basis, the question is: from where do profits come? The three established drugs do form a nice base, but as recent performance shows aren\\'t enough to drive overall profitability. Caldolor could help if it keeps trending in the right direction, but even that trend only suggests a million or two in incremental revenue - not enough to move the needle. The smaller products, particularly coming out of Q3, look to be in various stages of disarray. Vaprisol and Totect sales were near zero in the quarter - weakness that can\\'t be completely explained away by shortages. O-pak has had years to grow and instead has gone in the wrong direction. The ifetroban pipeline has been five years away for seven years. RediTrex is a late-to-market product that, like so many other CPIX products, will face intense competition and pricing pressure. Meanwhile, to support $6+ from a profit standpoint (given a pro forma enterprise value around $75 million), CPIX probably needs at least $9 million in incremental profits to get EBITDA to $7 million-plus. Given 30-50% royalties on Ethyol and Totect and milestone payments behind RediTrex, incremental margins probably aren\\'t that strong. Even assuming the top-line grows next year behind management\\'s three cited drivers (next-gen Caldolor, RediTrex, and VIBATIV), that doesn\\'t necessarily mean earnings improve all that notably.\\n That assumption seems awfully generous. VIBATIV clearly has a number of risks, ranging from the black box warnings to competition. Cumberland\\'s own history with its own strategy, admittedly with smaller deals, has been checkered at best. That history supports a scenario here in which VIBATIV disappoints, \\'next-gen\\' Caldolor doesn\\'t move the needle, and RediTrex falls well short of management projections. CPIX stock likely takes a dive given that earnings growth will be much smaller than expected/hoped - and that its upside catalysts will be largely exhausted by that point. Such a scenario is ~12 months out, at least, depending on the timing of the RediTrex launch, and the lack of a catalyst is a problem for the short case. So is the cash remaining on the balance sheet (~$25M) and still-reasonable P/S multiples (which are in the 1x range pro forma for VIBATIV and RediTrex). That\\'s probably enough to rule out a short - but the bull case here simply looks awfully thin. To listen to management, Cumberland has big opportunities on the way. But that\\'s been the same thing management has said going back to 2009. Not only has CPIX stock not responded but the business itself also hasn\\'t shown any progress. Earnings used to be positive; now they\\'re not. Revenue is down from early-decade levels, admittedly due almost solely to the erosion of Acetadote. Management\\'s response to those declines has been either slow and/or ineffective. Buying CPIX at $6.50 requires that to change - but looking closely, there are few reasons to expect that change, and many more to believe that the disappointments of the last nine years will continue going forward.\\nDisclosure: I/we have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

We came up with two familiar names - McDonald's (MCD) and Starbucks (SBUX). Both of these stocks have outperformed the market during this pullback and also have outperformed it year-to-date. Well, that makes sense, doesn't it? We all need to eat, and who hasn't had the guilty pleasure of a Big Mac or a latte at some point, although it would be a stretch to say these are really staples of any diet, unless you're talking about your average high school or college student. \\n\\nBoth stocks have received multiple upgrades from analysts - MCD has received three upgrades and two positive initiations since October: \\n\\nSBUX also has had several upbeat ratings from analysts: \\n\\n(Source: Yahoo Finance)\\n In terms of earnings estimates though, it has been a mixed bag for both of these stocks, with upward and downward revisions over the past month. MCD is net positive for full years 2018 and 2019, but it's a split decision for Q4 '18 and Q1 '19. The consensus EPS estimates are mostly flat for Q4 '18, Q1 '19 and full-year 2018, but show a 6.2% rise for 2019 vs. 2018: \\n\\n(Source: Yahoo Finance) SBUX's revisions are leaning much more toward the positive side for Q4 '18, Q1 '19 and full years 2018 and 2019, although the consensus EPS estimates look mostly flat, except for 2019 vs. 2018, which shows a 13.5% estimated rise in EPS: \\n\\n(Source: yahoo Finance) Analyst's Price Targets - MCD: At $171.42, MCD is slightly higher than analysts' lowest price target, but is 12.3% below the average $195.44 price target.  \\n\\nDividends - MCD: MCD's management raised its quarterly dividend by ~15% in November, to $1.16. MCD pays in a March/June/Sept/Dec. schedule, and should go ex-dividend again in early March. It yields ~2.71%, and has a dividend payout ratio of 55.20%, with average five-year dividend growth of 6.09%: \\n\\n\\n Options - MCD: Covered Calls: We added two trades for MCD to our free Covered Calls Table which tracks more than 30 other trades, and is updated throughout each trading day. MCD's March $180.00 call strike pays $5.60, nearly 5X the quarterly $1.16 dividend, so, on a short-term basis, you could enhance MCD's quite substantially. The flip side to that is MCD could blow right through $180.00, but you'd still only make $5.60/share on the call option. \\n\\nMCD also has a June option expiration, with a $180.00 strike bid premium of $8.65. This trade captures two ex-dividend dates for a total of $2.32 in dividend payments. Since the $180.00 strike is quite a bit above MCD's price/share, the potential price gain would be also greater than the $2.32 in dividend payouts, should your shares be assigned before the ex-dividend dates. \\n\\n MCD Put Options: We added these March and June put-selling trades to our Cash Secured Put Tables. MCD's March $165.00 put strike pays $5.35, again, much higher than the $1.16 quarterly dividend. This put option gives you a breakeven of $159.65, which is ~6% below analysts' lowest price target of $171.42 for MCD. \\n\\nGenerally, you'll get paid more for selling options further out in time, but you'll get paid less the further out of the money you sell at. This June $160.00 put strike pays $6.65, just about two times the next two dividends, and offers you a breakeven of $153.35, which is 9.8% below MCD's lowest price target:\\n \\n\\nDividends -SBUX: SBUX pays $.36, with a 2.33% yield, and has a very impressive five-year dividend growth average of 24.86%. It pays in a Feb/May/Aug.Nov. cycle, with a very conservative 16.97% dividend payout ratio. \\n\\n Options - SBUX: Covered Calls:  If you're looking to enhance your yield on a short term basis, these 2 covered call trades can do the trick. The SBUX March $65.00 call strike pays $1.85, over five times the $.36 dividend. \\n\\nThere's also a $65.00 call strike for June, which pays $3.10, over four times SBUX's two dividends during the term of this ~six-month trade. \\n\\nAnalyst's Price Targets - SBUX: At $61.87, SBUX is 12.5% above analysts' lowest price target of $55.00 and 9.9% below the average $68.64 price target. There's a 47% spread between the lowest and highest price targets for SBUX. \\n\\n\\n Cash Secured Put Options - SBUX: The March '19 $60.00 put strike pays $2.56, giving you a $57.44 breakeven, which is 4.4% above the $55.00 lowest price target for SBUX. \\n\\nMoving further out in time, to the June $60.00 put strike, would give you a $3.70 premium, which is more than five times the $.72 in dividends for the next two quarters. It gives you a $56.30 breakeven, which is ~2% above the lowest price target. \\n\\nNote: Put sellers don't receive dividends, we just list the dividends in our put tables, so viewers can compare them to the put premiums. You can see more details for these MCD and SBUX put trades, in addition to over 35 other trades, in our free Cash Secured Puts Table, which is updated throughout each trading day. If you're new to options, our Options Glossary explains the terms you'll come across using options-selling strategies. Summary: There are many other expirations and strike price levels for MCD and SBUX. If you want to be more conservative, you can sell puts even further below their current prices/share, which will offer lower option payouts, but also give you a lower breakeven. Given the higher market volatility, option premiums are currently offering much better yields than we've encountered in the past few years.

The ambitious capital program and the Pipestone acquisition also contributed to the growth. And considering the evolution of the stock price, management issued equity at an opportunistic moment to finance the Pipestone deal. Despite better netbacks for NuVista Energy (OTCPK:OTCPK:NUVSF) compared with Kelt Exploration (OTC:OTC:KELTF), the market values Kelt at a premium. As both companies operate a similar production mix, I don\\'t see any reason to prefer Kelt Exploration over NuVista Energy at these flowing barrel valuations. \\n\\n Image source: Anita_starzycka via Pixabay All the numbers in the article (including slides) are in Canadian dollars unless otherwise noted. Q3 results The Q3 production increased by 36% YoY due to the capital program and the Pipestone acquisition.

As a result of the increased production volume and with higher realized prices, revenue increased by about 81% YoY to reach C$151 million. \\n\\n Source: Q3 2018 MD&A Adjusted funds flow amounted to C$72.6 million and capex represented C$65.8 million. But the net debt increased due to the Pipestone acquisition. Yet, despite the limited contribution of the acquired assets, the net debt to adjusted funds flow ratio is still reasonable at 1.7. Great timing for an equity issuance The C$625 million Pipestone acquisition consists of:  35,250 net acres of land. Approximately 9,600 Boe/d of production. \"Significant\" infrastructure.  The acquisition was funded with a mix of credit facilities and issuance of 47.4 million shares at a price of $8.10 per share. The results of these transactions are summarized in the table below: \\n\\n\\n Source: Q3 2018 MD&A The equity issuance was done at a great timing as the price of C$8.10 per share is close to the highest stock price since 2015. And, due to the recent volatility of oil prices, the share price dropped below C$4 shortly after the equity issuance. \\n\\nNVA data by YCharts There is, of course, a part of luck in the timing of the equity issuance. But management was opportunistic anyway considering the stock price over the past years. Flexible capital program Management maintained the 2018 production guidance in the range of 38,750 to 40,000 boe/d. The 2018 capital program is also confirmed in the range of C$325 to C$350 million. About 2019, management keeps flexibility because of the volatility of oil and gas prices. Thus, the 2019 capital program is still in a wide range of C$300-$400 million. This forecast corresponds to a production increase of about 37% compared with 2018 at 52,000 to 56,000 boe/d. For the longer term, the company still plans to grow the production above 90,000 boe/d. Valuation compared with Kelt Exploration I compare NuVista Energy with Kelt Exploration. Both companies produce a similar mix of oil and gas. Also, they both operate in the Montney area. \\n\\n Source: Author, based on companies\\' reports The table below compares the costs and netbacks for both producers. \\n\\n\\n Source: Author, based on companies\\' reports We can see that cash costs are similar. But NuVista realizes better netbacks before hedging thanks to lower DD&A costs and thanks to higher realized prices. Despite the better netbacks for NuVista, the market values it at a lower flowing barrel price compared with Kelt Exploration. \\n\\n Source: Author, based on companies\\' reports Also, it is interesting to compare the evolution of the stock price of both producers over the last years. With the reference point at the end of 2015, NuVista\\'s stock price moved higher than Kelt\\'s during most of the last three years. But the trend reversed over the last few months. From the same base three years ago, NuVista\\'s stock price moved about 14% lower compared to Kelt\\'s stock price. \\n\\nNVA data by YCharts With a similar production mix, both companies are exposed to the volatility of oil prices in the same proportions. Kelt\\'s net debt is lower than NuVista\\'s. But with a net debt to adjusted funds flow ratio at 1.7, without the full contribution of the Pipestone acquisition, NuVista\\'s net debt is reasonable. And NuVista Energy realizes higher netbacks than Kelt Exploration. Thus, I don\\'t see any reason to prefer to invest in Kelt Exploration over NuVista Energy at current flowing barrel valuations. Conclusion Thanks to improved oil prices during Q3, and with an important capital program, the company increased its revenue by more than 81%.\\n Also, management took advantage of the stock price to acquire assets issuing equity. Shortly after the equity issuance, the stock price dropped due to the volatility of oil prices. Kelt Exploration, with a similar production mix and with a lower total netback, is valued at a premium compared with NuVista.

The key reasons for the \\'short\\' thesis are: likely higher than reported losses, negative price and earnings momentum, and mostly negative news (psychology). I expect to see an upward revision of reported losses given 1) market practices of relying on catastrophe loss models (which tend to underestimate losses) and 2) BCRH\\'s practices of upward revision of losses. There\\'s only so many times one can kick the can down the road, but at some point, ever increasing insurance claims are likely to catch up. Given continuously deteriorating liquidity at BCRH and low cash balance levels, it seems that the day of reckoning is not far. Personally, I\\'m currently short BCRH. I\\'m not suggesting that BCRH will experience extreme distress, but I will wait for Q4 results (expected to be published in late January) to re-evaluate the next steps. Putting short-term challenges of BCRH aside, the company represents an attractive \\'pure play\\' exposure to catastrophe insurance sub-industry and might be something to keep an eye on.    Blue Capital Reinsurance Holdings Overview We will start by talking about BCRH and then move on to an overview of the insurance industry and reinsurance sub-industry. BCRH provides reinsurance in the property catastrophe market in and outside of the United States. Some key data points about BCRH (as of December 24, 2018):  Microcap stock: $49.8M market cap High dividend yield: 21% dividend yield ($1.2 per share of annual dividend) Negative price momentum: 55% decrease in the last 52 weeks  During the latest earnings release (December 11), the company announced that impact of catastrophe losses for Q4 is estimated at $17M (mostly related to Hurricane Michael and California wildfires). Based on estimates, fully converted book value per common share is estimated to be between $11.25-$12 by the management. This announcement gave some clarity around potential losses and a glimpse of hope that it might not be as bad as feared. Initially, share price jumped by 36%, but that short-lived price action reversed back. We are back at pre-announcement price levels.\\n \\n\\n Source: Fidelity In the short-term, there doesn\\'t appear to be much good to say about BCRH. That said, when I came across the stock it drew my attention as a vehicle for retail investors to get exposure to insurance-linked securities. This would not be as clean of exposure to such product, but yet might be a good enough proxy available for the average retail investor. Why are insurance-linked securities are interesting? Because they provide exposure to an asset that is uncorrelated to more mainstream asset classes (i.e. diversification benefit) while providing reasonable rates of return (somewhere between stocks and bonds). See below a chart from BCHR presentation: \\n\\n Source: Blue Capital Reinsurance Holdings presentation   \"Short\" thesis  As noted earlier, the key reasons for the \\'short\\' thesis are: likely higher than reported losses (refer to section \\'fundamentals\\' below), negative price and earnings momentum (\\'momentum\\'), and mostly negative news (\\'psychology\\'). 1. Fundamentals How many different definitions of stock do you know? One general definition is, \"a stock represents a residual claim on profits of the company\"? So, in order to claim any stock is a candidate for shorting due to poor fundamentals, you would want to see that either current or future prospects are deteriorating. In my personal view, there are two such negative drivers of the underlying fundamental value of BCRH:  catastrophe losses related are likely underestimated, and overall industry pricing has been deteriorating for a few years now.  \\n On the first item of underestimation of losses, there are two factors that make me think that is the case: 1) BCRH has a \"habit\" of revising up the loss estimates and 2) industry models tend to underestimate losses (i.e., revisions are not particular to BCRH, it is more of \\'normal\\' market practice).  BCRH had revised their loss estimates every quarter this year. You might find more details on this first hand reviewing quarterly presentation decks for this year on BCRH\\'s website:   Q1\\'18 results: \"Experienced an increase in estimated losses related to Hurricane Irma which made landfall in Florida in September 2017\" Q3\\'18 results: YTD loss ratio was reported at 81.6%: 56.7% for the current year and 24.9% for prior year. ~25% loss ratio related to prior year!   The industry relies heavily on catastrophe loss models that, historically, have shown to underestimate ultimate losses in most cases. Please refer to results of the study conducted by JLT Re, which is presented in \"Reinsurance sub-industry overview\" section On the second item of deteriorating industry pricing, please refer to the graph below. Even though red circles show that pricing (premiums) tend to increase right after big catastrophe losses, generally global pricing index has been in a downtrend over the last 15 or so years. This, naturally, results in lower revenue. Ideally, you would have expected that costs (i.e., claims) would follow the same trend to ensure that industry bottom line stays intact. However, that is not the case. As you can see from the graph below frequency and severity of cat losses did not decrease: there’s a ‘big loss’ year every six years on average (2005, 2011, and 2017; losses of $120-$140B) and years in between these are in the range of $20-$80B. If anything, it seems that 2012—2016 interim years had higher industry loss figures on average than 2006-2010 interim years. \\n\\n\\n Source: Statista 2017 and BCRH presentation So what does all this mean \\'fundamentally\\'?  Below is one data point from the latest press release: fourth quarter results would be impacted by catastrophe losses currently estimated at $17.0 million dollars, which include losses related to Hurricane Michael, which made landfall in Florida in October 2018, as well as the 2018 California wildfires  So, for the sake of scenario analysis, let\\'s see what happens if BCRH underestimated 2018 losses by 25% (or just books it to 2019, as it happened in 2018). 25% of $17M equals ~$4M or ~8% of book value. Using a year-end $11.25 book value per share (as estimated by management), cutting 8% off would bring book value to $10.35. At the current stock price of $5.65 (by the time this article gets published number might have as well moved), it would translate to a BV multiple of 0.54x. Is 25% loss underestimation a realistic scenario or shall we consider the potential of larger magnitude? That\\'s the beauty of investing in microcaps, you don\\'t get answers to all of your questions. You can look at sub-industry practices and try to see whether specific microcap that you are reviewing is practicing something different. In the case of BCRH, it seems that underestimation is not particular to BCRH; it is just a \\'normal\\' industry practice. This, unfortunately, does not give you additional comfort, but just tells why there\\'s so much uncertainty around this company that is keeping stock price discount vs. book value at relatively sizable level. Is stock price cheap enough now to attract \"value investors\"? (perhaps \"yes\", but we will cover this item in \"Risk\" section)? Or perhaps, BCRH will continue to be \"falling knife\" forcing even value investors to stay aside until dust clears?  2. Momentum:  Unlike earlier years, BCRH has missed on earnings every quarter this year so far. Please refer to the chart below. Since Q3’17, when BCRH reported a large loss, the stock price has been on a downtrend. The last three quarterly misses, partially driven by revisions of loss estimates from catastrophes (talk about relying on models), further made BCRH story a pessimistic one.\\n \\n\\n Source: I/B/E/S Estimates and company reports 3. Psychology: Most of the relatively little research sources on BCRH are primarily negative (uninspiring earnings releases, earnings misses, and questions around BCRH’s ability to pay dividends). Furthermore, the level of stock price decrease puts BCRH among the underperformers of its sub-industry. Such a chain of negative “indicators” might exacerbate the desire to liquidate the long positions. Before we move on to industry and sub-industry overviews, let me cover off two other topics in relation to BCRH that might be of particular interest to the readers:  Market sentiment and consensus estimates Interest rate sensitivity of BCRH  Market sentiment and consensus estimates As you can see from the graph below, the consensus estimate is for a slightly larger loss in Q4\\'18 compared to Q3\\'18 miss. That said, you would also notice three quarters of earnings misses that we\\'ve discussed already. This doesn\\'t bode well for investor sentiment.  \\n\\n Source: Yahoo Finance Interest rate sensitivity of BCRH We will talk about capital market sensitivity of insurance companies in the section below. However, let\\'s take a minute to quickly review interest rate sensitivity of BCRH. Typically, you would expect insurance (and generally most of financial companies) to benefit from rate hikes. That said, impact of increasing interest rates is likely going to be immaterial in case of BCRH:\\n  BCRH mostly carries cash collateral; i.e., very low duration investments (to qualify as cash, investment maturity needs to be less than 90 days) BCRH has already burned most of its cash  In other words, BCRH has a low sensitivity to interest rates due to the nature of its investments. Underlying catastrophe reinsurance business is not much exposed to interest rates either; it\\'s mainly driven by frequency and magnitude of catastrophe losses. Insurance industry overview The insurance industry comprised mostly of property and casualty insurers (~36% of market cap of insurance companies in S&P 1500), while reinsurers make up the smallest sub-industry (~5%). Note that nearly 1/4th of property and casualty (P&C) insurers are mutual and reciprocal insurers (Liberty Mutual, Nationwide Mutual, State Farm, Farmers Insurance, etc.). Mutual insurers are owned by their policyholders, unlike their publicly traded counterparts that are owned by shareholders. In a way, mutual insurers do not have “shareholder return” considerations and might offer better-priced insurance (i.e. lower margin). The beauty of the insurance industry is that it is exposed to a different set of non-financial risks. For instance: P&C insurers are exposed to various risks of loss of property, while life insurers would be exposed to longevity risk. These couple of examples can give you some color on how the performance of underlying business can be very different from ebbs and flows of capital markets. This provides an opportunity for enterprising investor/ trader. Similar to risk premiums in capital markets (equity risk premium, volatility risk premium, etc.), risk premiums for insurance products at times get out of whack. For instance, a long period of lower than modeled catastrophe losses coupled with competitive industry tends to result in increased risk appetite (i.e. lower underwriting standards) and ultimately lower premiums. This quickly tends to reverse after major catastrophe losses when premiums tend to overshoot on the conservative side. Ajit Jain (Vice Chairman of Insurance for Berkshire Hathaway) was commended by Warren Buffett for his ability to get aggressive in righting policies right after major catastrophe when premiums tend to be very attractive. For more on this topic, you might find details in Warren Buffet’s biography (“The Snowball”).\\n That said, insurance companies are still rather exposed to capital markets in two key ways:  They invest their float in stocks, bonds, and at times in alternative investments. Net investment income can at times account for 20%-30% of insurer’s total revenues per CFRA. They raise funding in capital markets  There are other capital market risks that particular insurers might be exposed via their underwritten policies. Remember, AIG in 2018 with short credit exposure? In the hindsight, one way for a retail investor to get long CDS (not readily available product for retail investors) would have been to go short AIG shares or buying put on AIG shares in 2018. In other words, unlike commercial banks, you don’t have to wait for a credit crisis to short insurers. The nature of the business gives you more opportunities to go short even during bull markets (or specifically during a late bull market). Reinsurance sub-industry overview Reinsurers are effectively insurers of insurance companies. Similar to how you would transfer the risk of damaging your car to the insurance company when you buy auto insurance, insurance companies can similarly “buy insurance” from reinsurers. They would do so by ceding some of the risks to reinsurers in exchange for a portion of premiums they have collected on original insurance policies. Reinsurers can “buy” portion of entire risk class (e.g. auto insurance policies) from the insurance company for up to certain policy limit (first loss) or above agreed loss amount (similar to high-deductible insurance). Similar to insurers, reinsurance business is cyclical and goes through extremes of high/low premium environments. Given that our focus here is on Blue Capital Reinsurance Holdings (BCRH), we’re mostly focusing on the catastrophe reinsurance business.  As noted, typically premiums tend to increase right after major catastrophe loss. That said, CFRA noted that expectations for materially firmer premium rates in the aftermath of heavy storm losses failed to materialize in 2018 (source: “Industry Surveys: Insurance” published by CFRA in July 2018). This negatively impacts property catastrophe insurer and trickles down the chain to reinsurers as well.\\n Most of the industry relies heavily on catastrophe loss estimation models. Some develop such models internally and some rely on third-party providers. Models provide a data point for pricing policy premiums, however ultimately actual pricing depends on supply-demand and willingness of insurance companies to tighten/loosen underwriting standards. As a result, these models have practical use mostly after the fact. Once catastrophe took place, insurance companies (and reinsurers) are required to book/“write off” losses. Given that it takes some time before actual policy claims are fully honored, insurance companies rely on their models to size up/ estimate potential impact of losses that need to be booked. As you would have guessed given accounting standards do not allow reinsurers to book a range of possible outcomes, they end up using their best point estimate. So, not only that reinsurers are relying on models (with all model risk, backward-looking assumptions with some adjustments), but they can only use point estimate in booking “loss and loss adjustment expense”. A question: do you think insurance companies tend to end up booking a high end or low end of the range of potential losses? One might argue that they would book something in the middle of the range (it would be surprising to see the concept of accounting conservatism applied when it comes to this particular situation). Reinsurance broker JLT Re conducted a study of major Atlantic hurricanes since 2004 and found:  There’s a tendency toward significant loss underestimation Accuracy suffers due to un-modeled/ unforeseen consequences Model accuracy has, generally, improved over time  A graph from that study (see below) puts these findings into graphical form. As JLT Re team noted, that hurricanes that strike highly populated urban areas tend to lead to “unforeseen consequences that cause losses to spiral”. \\n\\n\\n Source: JLT Re Risks to Shorting Company-specific items that make shorting a risky proposition:  Book value: BCRH management estimate of the book value at $11.25-$12 by YE’18 vs. recent closing price of $5.65; i.e. BV multiple of 0.5x (or 0.4x if compared to $13.15 book value of Q3’18) Strategic shareholder support: Sompro International (large Japanese insurer) holds 33% investment in BCRH. There is a chance that Sompro might step in to provide backstop funding to BCRH. Sizable price jumps might squeeze some of the shorts: stock went from $5.37 to $7.29 in a couple of days (from December 11 to 13) printing 36% jump and recently retreated back to $5.65 (closing price on December 24). Transparency: generally, there’s lower coverage and information available for microcaps  When it comes to BV multiple, as shown in the graph below, BCRH is actually not excessively undervalued relative to its peers. \\n\\n Source: CapitalIQ But again, by saying that BCRH is not “excessively undervalued relative to its peers”, am I not relying on the model as well (public comps model for valuation of a company)? Perhaps, I should learn from the insurance industry and put some qualifiers and provide ranges for my price estimates. Or, perhaps, I should altogether avoid providing any price range estimate (you probably have heard about the accuracy of analyst forecasts). Implementation Given the risks of price jumps, it might be prudent to identify exit point before shorting the stock (this is typically a good idea regardless of whether you go long or short the stock). In other words, determine how much price needs to go up before you conclude that shorting BCRH was the wrong decision. In a meantime, don’t forget that this is high dividend stock, meaning that every quarterly dividend payment would come out of your pocket if you end up shorting the stock.\\n For reference purposes only (not an investment recommendation): my average entry price is $6.3 and stop-loss is placed at $8. I will consider moving stop-loss level if price decline continues. That decision would require thinking about risks of getting whipsawed (if stop-loss is too tight) and giving back all the gains (if trend truly reverses).   Conclusion For the reasons noted above, I am not putting specific price target. Instead, I\\'m just saying that for the reasons noted in “Short thesis” section, I personally think that BCRH has more headwinds than tailwinds.  Let me conclude by renumerating arguments for going short: 1) likely higher losses than estimated by management and models, 2) negative momentum, and 3) pessimistic market sentiment. Investing is not risk-free business and I do not claim to have a crystal ball.  Even though I’m currently short BCRH, I plan to keep an eye on this stock to see if it can survive the next recession. If it does, I’m likely to add BCRH to my core portfolio as “strategic” allocation/ proxy for insurance-linked products. In a meantime, happy holiday season to all the readers! Don’t forget to subscribe if you like this article. Your comments and suggestions are welcome (as always).  Disclosure: I am/we are short BCRH. I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions. I am not receiving compensation for it (other than from Seeking Alpha). I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article.']}\n"

It was going to happen anyway. The timing had recently become apparent as well, and in early August, I was able to write the following: \"The timing for the onset of the credit crisis looks like being any time from during the last quarter of 2018, only a few months away, to no later than mid-2019.\"[i] The crisis is arriving on cue and can be expected to evolve into something far nastier in the coming months. Corporate bond markets have seized up, giving us a signal it has indeed arrived. It is now time to consider how the credit crisis is likely to develop. It involves some guesswork, so we cannot do this with precision, but we can extrapolate from known basics to support some important conclusions. If it was only down to America without further feedback loops, we can now suggest the following developments are likely for the US economy. Warnings about an economic slowdown are persuading the Fed to soften monetary policy, a process recently set in motion and foreshadowed by US Treasury yields backing off. However, price inflation, which is being temporarily suppressed by falling oil prices, will probably begin to increase from Q2 in 2019. This is due to a combination of the legacy of earlier monetary expansion, and the consequences of President Trump\\'s tariffs on consumer prices. After a brief pause, induced mainly by the threat of an unstoppable collapse in equity prices, the Fed will be forced to continue to raise interest rates to counter price inflation pressures, which will take the rise in the heavily suppressed CPI towards and then through 4%, probably by mid-year. The recent seizure in commercial bond markets and the withdrawal of bank lending for working capital purposes sets in motion a classic unwinding of malinvestments. Unemployment begins to rise sharply, and consumer confidence goes into reverse. Equity prices continue to fall, as liquidity is drained from financial markets by worried investors, but price inflation remains stubbornly high. Consequently, bond prices continue to weaken under a lethal combination of foreign-owned dollars being sold, increasing budget deficits, and falling investor confidence in the future purchasing power of the dollar.\\n The US enters a severe recession, which is similar in character to the 1930-33 period. The notable difference is in an unbacked pure fiat dollar, which being comprised of swollen deposits[ii] (currently 67% of GDP versus 36% in 2007), triggers an attempted reversal of deposit accumulation. The purchasing power of the dollar declines, not least because over $4 trillion of these deposits are owned by foreigners through correspondent banks. One bit of good news is the US banking system is better capitalised than during the last crisis and is unlikely to be taken by surprise as much it was by the Lehman crisis. Consequently, US banks are likely to act more promptly and decisively to protect their capital, driving the non-financial economy into a slump more rapidly by calling in loans. Price inflation will not subside, because that requires sufficient contraction of credit to offset the declining preference for holding money relative to goods. Any credit contraction will be discouraged by the Fed, seeking to avert a deepening slump by following established monetary remedies. The Fed\\'s room for manoeuvre will be severely restricted by rising price inflation, which it can only combat with higher interest rates. Higher interest rates will become a debt trap springing tightly shut on government finances, forcing the Fed to buy US Treasuries under cover of monetary stimulation. The true reason for QE will be that with a rapidly escalating budget deficit exceeding $1.5 trillion and more, the Fed will want to suppress borrowing costs compared with what the market will demand. Economic conditions will be diagnosed as a severe case of stagflation. In reality, the US will be ensnared in a debt trap from which the line of least resistance will be accelerating monetary inflation. It will prove difficult for neo-Keynesian central bankers to understand the seeming contradiction that an economy can suffer a slump and escalating price inflation at the same time. It is, however, the condition of all monetary inflations and hyperinflations suffered by economies with unbacked fiat currencies. The choice will be to rewrite the textbooks, discarding current groupthink, or to soldier on. We can be certain the neo-Keynesians will soldier on, because they are intellectually unable to reform existing monetary policy in a manner acceptable to them.\\n That would be the likely outcome of the developing credit crisis if it wasn\\'t for external factors. There is precedent for it, and we can expect it from a purely theoretical analysis. It would be a rolling crisis, becoming progressively worse, taking six months to a year to unfold, followed by a period of economic recovery. But there is a major snag with this analysis for the US economy, and that is US monetary policy has long been coordinated with the monetary policies of other major central banks through forums such as the Bank for International settlements, G20 and G7 meetings. The surprise election of President Trump upset this apple-cart with his untimely budget stimulus and the havoc he is wreaking on international trade. The result is the Fed is no longer on the same page as the other major central banks, particularly the Bank of Japan and the European Central Bank. Therefore, unlike crisis phases of previous credit cycles, the Eurozone enters it with negative interest rates, as does Japan, which are creating enormous currency and banking tensions. We will put Japan to one side in our search for knock-on systemic and economic effects triggered by the Fed\\'s increase in interest rates, and instead focus on the Eurozone, the heart of the European Union. The Eurozone is irretrievably bust It is easy to conclude the EU, and the Eurozone in particular, is a financial and systemic time-bomb waiting to happen. Most commentary has focused on problems that are routinely patched over, such as Greece, Italy, or the impending rescue of Deutsche Bank (NYSE:DB). This is a mistake. The European Central bank and the EU machine are adept in dealing with issues of this sort, mostly by brazening them out, while buying everything off. As Mario Draghi famously said, whatever it takes. There is a precondition for this legerdemain to work. Money must continue to flow into the financial system faster than the demand for it expands, because the maintenance of asset values is the key. And the ECB has done just that, with negative deposit rates and its €2.5 trillion Asset Purchase Programme. That programme ends this month, making it the likely turning point, whereby it all starts to go wrong.\\n Most of the ECB\\'s money has been spent on government bonds for a secondary reason, and that is to ensure Eurozone governments remain in the euro-system. Profligate politicians in the Mediterranean nations are soon disabused of their desires to return to their old currencies. Just imagine the interest rates the Italians would have to pay in lira on their €2.85 trillion of government debt, given a private sector GDP tax base of only €840bn, just one third of that government debt. It never takes newly-elected Italian politicians long to understand why they must remain in the euro system, and that the ECB will guarantee to keep interest rates significantly lower than it would otherwise be. Yet the ECB is now giving up its asset purchases, so it won\\'t be buying Italian debt or any other for that matter. The rigging of the Eurozone\\'s sovereign debt market is at a turning point. The ending of this source of finance for the PIGS[iii] is a very serious matter indeed. A side effect of the ECB\\'s asset purchase programme has been the reduction of Eurozone bank lending to the private sector, which has been crowded out by the focus on government debt. This is illustrated in the following chart. \\n\\n Following the Lehman crisis, the banks were forced to increase their lending to private sector companies, whose cash flow had taken a bad hit. Early in 2012 this began to reverse, and today total non-financial bank assets are even lower than they were in the aftermath of the Lehman crisis. Regulatory pressure is a large part of the reason for this trend, because under the EU\\'s version of the Basel Committee rules, government debt in euros does not require a risk weighting, while commercial debt does.[iv] So our first danger sign is the Eurozone banking system has ensured that banks load up on government debt at the expense of non-financial commercial borrowers.\\n The fact that banks are not serving the private sector helps explain why the Eurozone\\'s nominal GDP has stagnated, declining by 12% in the six largest Eurozone economies over the ten years to 2017. Meanwhile, the Eurozone\\'s M3 money increased by 39.2%. With both the ECB\\'s asset purchasing programmes and the application of new commercial bank credit bypassing the real economy, it is hardly surprising that interest rates are now out of line with those of the US, whose economy has returned to full employment under strong fiscal stimulus. The result has been banks can borrow in the euro LIBOR market at negative rates, sell euros for dollars and invest in US Government Treasury Bills for a round trip gain of between 25% and 30% when geared up on a bank\\'s base capital. The ECB\\'s monetary policy has been to ignore this interest rate arbitrage in order to support an extreme overvaluation in the whole gamut of euro-denominated bonds. It cannot go on forever. Fortunately for Mario Draghi, the pressure to change tack has lessened slightly as signs of a US economic slowdown appear to be increasing, and with it, further dollar interest rate rises deferred. TARGET2 Our second danger sign is the massive TARGET2 interbank imbalances, which have not mattered so long as everyone has faith that it does not matter. This faith is the glue that holds a disparate group of national central banks together. Again, it comes down to the maintenance of asset values, because even though assets are not formally designated as collateral, their values underwrite confidence in the TARGET2 system. Massive imbalances have accumulated between the intra-regional central banks, as shown in our next chart, starting from the time of the Lehman crisis. \\n\\n\\n Germany\\'s Bundesbank, at just under €900bn is due the most, and Italy, at just under €490bn owes the most. These imbalances reflect accumulating trade imbalances between member states and non-trade movements of capital, reflecting capital flight. Additionally, imbalances arise when the ECB instructs a regional central bank to purchase bonds issued by its government and local corporate entities. This accounts for a TARGET2 deficit of €251bn at the ECB, and surpluses to balance this deficit are spread round the regional central banks. This offsets other deficits, so the Bank of Italy owes more to the other regional banks than the €490bn headline suggests. Trust in the system is crucial for the regional central banks owed money, principally Germany, Luxembourg, Netherlands and Finland. If there is a general deterioration in Eurozone collateral values, then TARGET2 imbalances will begin to matter to these creditors. Eurozone banks Commercial banks in the Eurozone face a number of problems. The best way of illustrating them is by way of a brief list:  Share prices of systemically important banks have performed badly following the Lehman crisis. In Germany, Commerzbank (OTCPK:CRZBY) and Deutsche Bank have fallen 85% from their post-Lehman highs, Santander (NYSE:SAN) in Spain by 66%, and UniCredit (OTCPK:UNCFY) in Italy by 88%. Share prices in the banking sector are usually a reliable barometer of systemic risks. The principal function of a Eurozone bank has always been to ensure its respective national government\\'s debt requirement is financed. This has become a particularly acute systemic problem in the PIGS. Basel II and upcoming Basel III regulations do not require banks to take a risk haircut on government debt, thereby encouraging them to overweight government debt on their balance sheets, and underweight equivalent corporate debt. Banks no longer serve the private sector, except reluctantly. Eurozone banks tend to have higher balance sheet gearing than those in other jurisdictions. A relatively small fall in government bond prices puts some of them at immediate risk, and if bond prices decline, it is the weakest banks that will bring down the whole banking system. Eurozone banks are connected to the global banking system through interbank exposure and derivative markets, so systemic risks in the Eurozone are transmitted to other banking systems. \\n This list is not exhaustive, but it can be readily seen that an environment of declining asset prices and higher euro bond yields increases systemic threats to the entire banking system. As was the case with Austria\\'s Credit-Anstalt failure in 1931, one falling domino in the EU can easily topple the rest. The ECB itself is a risk As stated above, the ECB through its various asset purchase programmes has caused the accumulation of some €2.5 trillion of debt, mostly in government bonds. The euro system\\'s central banks now have a balance sheet total of €4.64 trillion, for which the ECB is the ringmaster. Most of this debt is parked on the NCBs\\' balance sheets, reflected in the TARGET2 imbalances. The ECB\\'s subscribed equity capital is €7.74bn and its own balance sheet total is €414bn.[v] This gives an operational gearing on core capital of 53 times. Securities held for monetary purposes (the portion of government debt purchased under various asset purchase programmes shown on the balance sheet) is shown at €231bn (it will have increased further in the current year). This means a fall in the value of these securities of only 3% will wipe out all the ECB\\'s capital. If the ECB is to avoid an embarrassing recapitalisation when, as now seems certain, bond yields rise, it must continue to rig euro bond markets. Therefore, the reintroduction of its asset purchase programmes to stop bond yields rising becomes the last fling of the dice. The debt trap Eurozone governments find themselves in has also become a trap for the ECB. Conclusion We can see that the global credit crisis has now been triggered. It always happens at some point anyway. The proximate triggers have been non-monetary, being the combination of President Trump\\'s fiscal reflation late in the credit cycle, and his imposition of tariffs on imported goods. The weakening of other economies from Trump\\'s tariff war is an additional factor undermining the global economic outlook. Given these fiscal developments, the Fed had no option but to seek to urgently normalise interest rates, bringing on the credit crisis.\\n Inaction by the Fed would have undoubtedly seen price inflation accelerate, even allowing for the confines of a heavily suppressed consumer price index. The slowing of the US economy has, at least for the short-term, reduced price inflation factors. But as argued in this article, they are unlikely to last. These monetary developments have come at a time when two important central banks, the ECB and the Bank of Japan, are still applying negative interest rates. The disparity between these policies and that of the Fed, besides creating monetary and currency strains, will almost certainly lead to them both revising monetary policies. Only this month, quantitative easing in the Eurozone ceases, and bond prices are likely to fall significantly without it. A rise in the ECB\\'s deposit rate from minus 0.4% will surely follow, and it is hard to see how a developing systemic crisis in the region can then be prevented. Since the Lehman crisis, inflation has been mostly bottled up in the financial sector, while being statistically suppressed in the productive economy. That is now about to change, leading to excess deposits at the banks trying to escape the consequences of their deployment for mainly financial speculation. It will not provide a boost in consumption, because consumers are maxed out and unemployment is rising. It will simply undermine the purchasing power of an increasingly unwanted, unbacked fiat currency.

So, the highest yielding stocks in any collection have become affectionately known as \"dogs.\" More precisely, these are, in fact, best called, \"underdogs\". Eight Sectors Were Represented By December Barron\\'s/Kiplinger Listed \\'Safer\\' Dividend Stocks\\n Of eleven sectors, eight were represented by the 17 stocks with past year positive returns and current cash margins greater than their announced annual dividends. The count of 17 \\'safer\\' dividend Barron\\'s/Kiplinger equities by sector showed: consumer defensive (1), energy (1), real estate (1), financial services (3), healthcare (3), industrials (4), technology (2), consumer cyclical 2), basic materials (0), communication services (0), and utilities (0). Source: YCharts \\n\\n \\n\\n Periodic Safety Check A previous article discussed the attributes of the 10 Barron\\'s 2019 Favorites vs. Kiplinger Today\\'s \"12 Stocks You Should Never Sell.\" You see below the tinted green list that passed the dividend \"stress\" test. These 17 Barron\\'s/Kiplinger stocks report positive annual returns and sufficient cash flow yield to cover their anticipated dividend yield, the margin of cash flow excess being shown in the boldface \"Safety Margin\" column. One of the 22 was disqualified by negative one-year returns; two paid no dividends. Four were discarded with free cash flow yields less than their dividend yields. Source: YCharts \\n\\n\\n Corporate cash flow, however, is easily re-directed by any board of directors managing company policy. Directors can cancel or vary the payout of dividends to shareholders. For example, Altria Group Inc., top dog on the list above, cut their quarterly dividend from $0.75 to $0.29 in 2008, raised the Q stipend to $0.32 in 2009 and to $0.34 in 2010. Altria Group Q dividends have since risen annually to their present $0.80 in 2018, where they currently stand. Three additional columns of reported cash data listed after the safety margin figures on the charts above, reveal payout ratios (lower is better), total annual returns, dividend growth, and P/E ratio levels for each stock. This data is provided to reach beyond yield to select reliable payout stocks. The one-year total returns column above showed one stock exhibiting tumbling returns. Yield Metrics Uncovered Significant Price Advantages For 5 Low-Price Barron\\'s/Kiplinger 2019 \\'Safer\\' Dividend Stocks Ten \\'safer\\' dividend top Barron\\'s/Kiplinger stocks for December 21 per YCharts data ranked themselves by yield as follows: Source: YCharts \\n\\n Ten top \\'safer\\' Barron\\'s/Kiplinger 2019 dividend paying stocks were culled by Yield (dividend/price). Results were verified by Yahoo Finance.  Actionable Conclusions: Analysts Concluded 5 Lowest-Priced of Top Ten High Yield Barron\\'s/ Kiplinger \\'Safer\\' Dividend Stocks Would Deliver (11) 30.56% Vs. (12) 27.33% Net Gains for All Ten by December 2019  Source: YCharts \\n\\n\\n $5,000 invested as $1k in each of the five lowest priced stocks in the top ten Barron\\'s/Kiplinger 2019 Kennel by yield were predicted by analyst one-year targets to deliver 11.81% more net gain than $5,000 invested as $.5k in each of all ten. The second lowest priced Delta Air Lines Inc. was projected to deliver the best net gain of 41.37%. Ten Barron\\'s/Kiplinger \\'Safer\\' Dividend Picks Saw 11.81% More Gain From 5 Highest Yield, Lowest Priced Stocks Source: YCharts \\n\\n Lowest priced five Barron\\'s/Kiplinger \\'safer\\' dividend stocks as of December 21 were: Altria Group Inc., Delta Air Lines Inc., Realty Income Corp. (O), JPMorgan Chase & Co., and Chevron Corp., with prices ranging from $49.09 to $104.21. Higher priced five Barron\\'s/Kiplinger \\'safer\\' dividend stocks as of December 21 were: Caterpillar Inc., Johnson & Johnson (JNJ), Amgen Inc. (AMGN), 3M Co (MMM), and BlackRock Inc., whose prices ranged from $120.07 to $369.16. This distinction between five low-priced dividend dogs and the general field of ten reflect the \"basic method\" Michael B. O\\'Higgins employed for beating the Dow. The added scale of projected gains based on analyst targets contributed a unique element of \"market sentiment\" gauging upside potential. It provided a here and now equivalent of waiting a year to find out what might happen in the market. It\\'s also the work analysts got paid big bucks to do.

Although macroeconomic condition in 2019 appears to be uncertain, we believe National Bank of Canada should perform better than other banks thanks to its (1) focus in Quebec, (2) limited oil and gas loan exposure, and (3) low exposure to the real estate markets in Greater Toronto Area and Greater Vancouver Area. The company’s shares are attractively valued and offer a growing 4.4%-yielding dividend. We believe it is a good choice for investors. However, given the volatility in the market lately, we believe investors should exercise caution and patiently wait for a better entry point. \\n\\n Source: YCharts Q4 2018 Financial Highlights: Slower Growth Expected National Bank of Canada posted solid top and bottom lines growth in its fiscal 2018. As can be seen from the table below, its revenue increased by 8% year over year. Similarly, its net income and diluted EPS increased by 10% each in 2018. In 2018, the company saw its efficiency ratio improved by 130 basis points to 54.6%. \\n\\n\\n Source: Q4 2018 Investor Presentation Despite good growth in 2018, we highlighted a few trends we have observed lately in the following two subsections below: Flat net interest margin sequentially Since mid-2017, Canada has raised its benchmark interest rate five times. These rate hikes have helped improve its net interest margin from the low of 2.24% in Q2 2017 to 2.33% in Q4 2018. However, its NIM in Q4 stays the same quarter over quarter. Looking forward, it may be challenging to expand its NIM in 2019. This is because Bank of Canada has recently switched from a more hawkish tone back in October to a much more dovish tone on Dec. 5, 2018. In the statement that BoC released, it says: Signs are emerging that trade conflicts are weighing more heavily on global demand… the global economic expansion is moderating. Many analysts believe that the message is quite clear: Rate hikes are off the table for now. Hence, we believe there will be fewer rate hikes in 2019 than in 2018. \\n\\n Source: Created by author; Company Reports Challenge to grow its personal loan portfolio Although still growing, National Bank of Canada’s personal loan volume growth rate has decelerated considerably in 2018 due to the implementation of Guideline B-20. In addition, elevated Canadian household debts coupled with 5 interest rate hikes has made it challenging for Canadian banks to grow its residential mortgage portfolio. As can be seen from the chart below, National Bank of Canada’s personal loan growth has stayed flat in 2018. Its loan growth rate has decelerated to 3.5% in Q4 2018 from 7.1% in Q1 2016. \\n\\n\\n Source: Created by author; Company Reports Reasons why we think National Bank of Canada should perform relatively better than its peers Limited exposure to energy sector Many investors are concerned about the impact of the recent fall of oil prices on Canada’s energy sector. Fortunately, National Bank of Canada does not have a high exposure to Canada’s oil and gas industry. In fact, the oil and gas industry only represents about 4.6% of the bank's total commercial loans. This ratio is one of the lowest among Canadian banks. It is also much better than the bank’s exposure in the last oil market crash (in late 2015 and early 2016). As can be seen from the chart below, its current exposure of 4.6% of its total commercial loan is much less than the 7.6% exposure back in Q1 2016. \\n\\n Source: Created by author; Company Reports Low exposure to Canada’s hottest real estate markets National Bank of Canada has a low exposure to Greater Toronto Area and Greater Vancouver Area. These two markets are the two hottest real estate markets in Canada. Many believe that these two markets are near bubble territory and set for a correction. Fortunately, the bank has low exposure to these two markets. In fact, uninsured mortgages and home equity lines of credit in these two regions represent only 9% and 2% of the total portfolio and have an average loan-to-value of 52% and 47% respectively. For reader’s information, mortgages and HELOC in GTA and GVA represent about 45% and 44% of CIBC’s (CM) mortgage balances and HELOC balances respectively. \\n\\n\\n Source: Q4 2018 Investor Presentation National Bank of Canada’s focus in Quebec should be helpful National Bank of Canada has a strong focus in Quebec. In fact, Quebec represents about 57.2% of its total Canadian loans (see chart below). \\n\\n Source: Q4 2018 Investor Presentation We like National Bank of Canada’s focus in Quebec. As can be seen from the left chart below, Quebec’s real GDP growth is expected to top all other Canadian provinces. Although Quebec’s real GDP growth in 2019 is expected to moderate to 1.8% in 2019, this growth rate is still above the national average. \\n\\n Source: RBC Economic Research Quebec is near full employment as the province’s unemployment rate of 5.4% in 2018 (forecasted) is the lowest since 1976. This low unemployment rate is also the second lowest among all Canadian provinces. \\n\\n Source: RBC Economic Research Looking forward to 2019, Quebec’s projected unemployment rate of 5.5% will continue to be the second lowest among Canadian provinces (see table below). The province’s projected retail sales growth rate of 4% in 2019 will be second only to Ontario. Hence, we believe business activities and consumer confidence will remain robust in 2019. These economic forecasts support our view that National Bank of Canada, who's focused in Quebec, should perform better than other non-Quebec focused Canadian banks in 2019.\\n \\n\\n Source: RBC Economic Research Valuation Analysis Share price of National Bank of Canada has declined by over 15% in the past 3 months. National Bank of Canada’s forward P/E ratio of 8.7x is now the second lowest among the top 6 Canadian banks (see chart below). Only Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce has a lower P/E ratio than National Bank of Canada. Its forward P/E ratio is also below the 9.1x average of its peers. Similarly, its price to trailing 12-months earnings ratio of 9.3x is also the second lowest among its Canadian peers. \\n\\n Source: YCharts Frequent dividend increases National Bank of Canada has an excellent track record of dividend growth. The bank has recently increased its quarterly dividend from C$0.62 per share to C$0.65 per share. On a trailing basis, its dividend yield is about 4.44% (see chart below). As can be seen from the chart below, its current dividend yield is towards the high end of the yield range in the past 10 years. \\n\\n Source: YCharts Risks and Challenges National Bank of Canada faces macroeconomic risks related to the credit and debt cycle. Canada’s mortgage debt levels have increased considerably in the past decade. As the chart below shows, its debt-to-income ratio is expected to reach 173% by the end of 2018, the highest we have seen in many decades. We believe the elevated debt level coupled with 5 interest rate hikes since mid-2017 will continue to limit future mortgage growth in 2019. In addition, the potential for consumer defaults will increase especially when the economy is heading toward a downturn.\\n \\n\\n Source: RBC Economics \\n\\n Source: RBC Economics Investor Takeaway Although macroeconomic outlook appears to be uncertain in 2019, we believe National Bank of Canada will perform better than other Canadian banks thanks to its good risk management and its focus in Quebec. Its shares appear to be attractive on a relative basis. However, given the volatility in the stock market lately, it does not hurt to apply a wait-and-see approach and patiently find a better entry point.

While there are currently less features than in the previous version, the entire tool is bullet-proof, very easy to use and as simple as possible. I have been very delighted by all the positive and constructive feedback I have received over the last year, and thus instead of trying to fix the existing tool, I decided it was time to build it up from scratch. At the core of this new release is the notion that all data will be extracted from Seeking Alpha, thereby leveraging the power of the platform and avoiding unreliable data imports. Over time I will add the old and new features to the tool and release them. We will no longer use slow and unreliable Google sheets but instead use Excel and Tableau Public. I am sure the latter is new to many people, but I feel very confident that you will love it as much as I do for these purposes. To get you started, you will need the following four things:  Create an account on Seeking Alpha and set up a Portfolio containing the stocks you want to track. The Dividend Calendar currently supports up to 200 stocks. Download the new \"Dividend Calendar\" tool; free for everyone to use. Download Tableau Public for full interactivity. This is optional but will greatly enhance user experience, especially for future releases of the \"Dividend Calendar\" tool. Read this article to understand what the tool can do for you and how to set up. \\n Note: Unfortunately, I only have a PC and thus cannot tell whether it will work on a Mac. In case it works smoothly, please let me know so that I can eventually take out that disclaimer here. First, a personal wish here: As this article here is not about the typical content found on Seeking Alpha (stocks, strategy, etc.), I cannot anticipate how many readers will see it, thus adding importance to your feedback as to whether you find this as useful as I do, encounter any difficulties, or have any other feedback to report. Please let me know so in the comments section. Thanks! What is the purpose of all this? To keep it short, I generally envision the following use cases with the tool in its current release:  As a dividend investor, I want to constantly monitor when and which stocks are going ex-dividend without having to check several different links (one per stock) every day to retrieve that information in a cumbersome and manual way. As a dividend investor, I want to distribute my dividend income across the different months. Therefore, I want to find out which stocks are paying in which month and then do further research on these or use this information as an additional aspect to consider when managing my current and future investments. As a dividend investor, I want to centrally track and visualize upcoming dividends for the stocks I own.  As a dividend investor, I want to have a simple and easy-to-use and easy-to-set-up tool which also allows the technical less savvy investor to work with it in an intuitive way.   To put it differently, the tool will help you achieve the following:  Serve as a central and interactive go-to destination to track upcoming ex-dividend dates and dividend payments. Monitor historic and future dividend performance over time by providing a central dashboard and further tracking options.  What data are we using, and how do we import it? Generally, we will use data from Seeking Alpha\\'s Portfolio feature in order to retrieve ex-dividend dates, dividend yields, dividend growth, the actual dividend rate and the payout ratio (payment dates are currently not provided here but can either be manually added into the tool or extrapolated based on historic days between ex-dividend date and payment date).\\n Therefore, you need to first set up an account with Seeking Alpha and then create a new portfolio. In the screenshot below, I have set up a portfolio with all members of the Dow Jones which looks as follows when you click on the \"Dividends\" tab: \\n\\n This gives a comprehensive and real-time overview of all relevant dividend metrics. We can create multiple portfolios here that we want to track and import up to 200 stocks into the custom tool. The other tabs, such as \"Momentum\", \"Valuation\" or \"Profitability\", offer rich information as well but won\\'t be used in the custom tool for now. Now, to import that data into the tool, you only have to copy and paste the respective section into the respective Excel sheet. There is a very easy to use checklist included in the tool as well as a concise GIF showcasing it here. Additionally, on the \"Holdings\" tab, you can add the number of shares to your stocks that you currently own. This data will then later be used to calculate upcoming dividend payments and track progress. \\n\\n The tool itself comes with pre-populated data for all members of the Dow Jones (10 shares in each stock), but you can completely customize these and import your own list of stocks and respective shares that you want to track. The Output Once everything is set up (i.e., you created a \"Portfolio\" on Seeking Alpha, copied that data into the Excel tool and followed the steps on the \"Checklist\" sheet), the Excel Tool\\'s output sheet \"DividendCalendar\" looks as follows:\\n \\n\\n So this sheet contains a lot of information. I have numbered the individual sections and will outline their meaning subsequently   One-year overview: This 12-month rolling calendar always covers the next 12 full months, in this case from December 2018 to November 2019. It highlights all ex-dividend dates over that period for the stocks you want to track with a little red flag symbol. Based on the number of stocks going ex-dividend on that day, the color changes from light blue to dark blue. Saturdays and Sundays are grayed out.  Daily Dividend Information: By clicking on any date in the calendar in 1) this section displays all relevant information for the stock going ex-dividend currently; it will inform you about the ex-dividend date, the dividend payment date and the declared $ dividend per share amount. Additionally, if you own shares in this stock, it will calculate the total gross dividend payment. Here we have selected February 28 where we expect 7 Dow members to go ex-dividend. \\n\\n   Days until ex-dividend date by stock: This provides an overview of when stocks will go ex-dividend, displaying the number of days until that day is reached as well as displaying the exact date.  Payment Dashboard: This is an interactive chart depicting expected dividend payments by day and stock. It is color-coded into three categories, where blue indicates payment information for stocks that have declared an ex-dividend date; red represents officially declared ex-dividend dates where the last ex-dividend date has already been passed but payment is still outstanding, hence, the next ex-dividend date has not yet been declared; and gray indicates payments dates for stocks that haven\\'t declared the next ex-dividend date yet and whose previous dividend has already been paid - for these stocks the information is derived by assuming that the payment in the previous year will repeat itself in the current year. These slicers allow to filter the data. Slicers colored in purple apply to 3) slicers in pink, 4) turquoise slicers apply to both.  Next ex-dividend date: Here we are notified about the next ex-dividend date based on today\\'s date. In case multiple stocks go ex-dividend date on that date, it shows data for the first one in alphabetical order; here it is American Express (AXP). \\n\\n   \"FIX\" button: Hit this button if the \"Daily Dividend Information\" is not refreshing when you click on a color-coded date in section 2. \\n That was a lot of explanation. Let\\'s now illustrate the core use cases that I would like to cover with that solution. As mentioned above, I will specifically highlight where the added features will come in handy for this use case. As a dividend investor, I want to centrally track and visualize upcoming dividends for the stocks I own. I do not want to copy and paste that information each time. I also want to be able to see historic development and track progress at different points of time over time. Putting it into practice To track and visualize upcoming dividends for the stocks you own, you can view that information as part of the interactive calendar on the \"DividendCalendar\" sheet. Once you have set up everything correctly, you will get a chart like this: \\n\\n So here you can see the following:  In blue, upcoming gross dividend payments that have been declared based on the number of shares you have. In red, upcoming gross dividend payments for stocks where the ex-dividend date has already been passed but the dividend has not been paid yet. For instance, Nike (NKE) already went ex-dividend on November 30, but the respective payment (scheduled for January 2) has not yet been paid. In gray, expected upcoming gross dividend payments for stocks where the next ex-dividend has not been officially declared but has been derived based on when the company\\'s stock went ex-dividend the year before. As you can see, Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) is colored in gray, which indicates that the company has not yet declared the next ex-dividend date, but is expected to pay on March 11, 2019. The corresponding dividend payment received in 2018 dates back to March 13, 2018.  Finally, there is Tableau. As a starting point, I have only prepared a viz that depicts upcoming dividend payments in a calendar view. This is fully filterable and interactive. Right now, it shows all members of the Dow and expected dividend payments at 10 shares in each stock. This is in beta stadium and as such not yet customizable which will follow with future releases. It is meant to give a glimpse of how we can leverage that data using Tableau. For instance, the ex-dividend calendar now looks like this:\\n \\n\\n If you hover over the February 28 data, you will see a little box appear which shows all stocks going ex-dividend on that date with their dividend per share and expected future payment. By using the slider at the top-right, you can only show those dates, where, for e.g., three stocks go ex-dividend; in this case only on January 3 and February 15: \\n\\n The other viz \"Expected Payments\" shows a different calendar view of upcoming dividend payments by stock and reveals the following information when hovering over any data point; in the example below, I hovered over Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO): \\n\\n Finally Personally, I hope that you enjoy this tool as much as I do, and I am very grateful for having a platform here to publish and share my work. Without that platform, I would never ever have built these tools in the way they are now, and so I am very much looking forward to your feedback. Just let me know what sort of features you would like. Are you missing specific metrics? Are you missing specific charts?\\nDisclosure: I am/we are long AAPL, CSCO, DIS, INTC, JNJ, JPM, KO, MCD, MMM, MSFT, NKE, PFE, PG, V, VZ, WBA, XOM.

The specific contract of reference is the NYMEX WTI Crude Oil February 2019 futures contract (CLG9). All indicators and valuations reflect the same. Quick Take On the back of rising inventories and deteriorating sentiment, the crude market has plunged toward my models’ measures of fair value. The bearish technical momentum is still fierce, and we may see a further drop toward longer-term technical support around $40-42/bbl. With bearish sentiment already quite extended, I don’t believe the bears have the requisite ammunition to break through that support. I expect it to hold, with $50 functioning as near-term resistance should the shorts abandon their positions. Short of an unexpected pickup in demand or significant and prolonged production outages, we will probably need OPEC+ or Iran sanction waiver reductions to remove another 500 thousand barrels/day from the market for a sustained breach of $50/bbl. My View Early in 2017, the OPEC+ production cuts became evident in visible global oil inventories. At first, the oil market was hesitant to buy into the improving fundamentals, as it had been severely chastened by the precipitous plunge in crude from 2014-2016. By mid-year however, the bulls came to life. WTI crude prices rose from $44/bbl to nearly $70 by February of 2018. Bullish speculative sentiment soared. After a brief pullback below $60 during the February equity sell-off, crude resumed its upward march. The market clung to the bullish narratives, while brushing aside the bearish, as a growing number of analysts were calling for $100 oil. With crude ultimately topping at $77 on October 3rd, these calls have proven to be ill-advised, and the build up in sentiment led to an overpriced market that sowed the seeds for its recent collapse.\\n Earlier this year, with a booming global economy, rapidly declining Venezuelan production, and a hyper-focus on the anticipated Iran sanctions, the crude market seemed to all but ignore the hard data that ran counter to the bullish story. US shale production has exploded, lifting total US crude production by over 3 million bpd (barrels/day) since 2016, and an additional 1.2-1.3 million bpd is expected next year. While Iranian production has indeed dropped by about 1 million bpd from its recent peak in May, Saudia Arabia and Russia have more than made up for the reduction, and by mid-2018, global oil inventories were once again on the rise. The US has extended sanction waivers to 75% of Iran’s oil importers, prompting analysts to estimate continued Iranian exports of between 1 and 1.5 million bpd (in line with October export estimates compiled by Refinitiv). The “synchronized global growth” story that pervaded the market throughout 2017 has revealed some undeniable cracks, with industrial indicators out of China and Europe pointing to a slowdown. A hiking Federal Reserve and strong relative growth out of the United States drove the dollar sharply upwards, making crude oil (which is priced in US dollars) more expensive for international buyers and incentivizing production for international producers, both bearish for crude. All the while, despite a brief pullback from peak bullishness in February, speculative sentiment remained extreme. In early October, the story quickly changed. The combination of over-extended bullish sentiment detaching crude from \"fair value\" and a deteriorating macroeconomic backdrop was met with rapidly rising US oil inventories and a global shift in risk sentiment. This prompted the precipitous fall of over 40% in WTI crude prices that we\\'ve witnessed over the past two months. In response, OPEC+ (OPEC plus Russia and former soviet countries) recently agreed to cut production by 1.2 million bpd next year, with suggestions this week they would adjust further if necessary. In my view, these cuts are simply insufficient, and we will need another 500 thousand bpd removed from the supply/demand balance one way or another to sustain WTI crude prices above $50/bbl.\\n Ganalytics Throughout my analysis, I will utilize indicators, charts, and features from an extensive, data-driven analytics platform I developed, the “Reduction Reports”. Instead of just providing vague analysis and relevant context, I will quantify everything we discuss through the Reports’ analytics. Rather than simply describing something as “bearish” or “bullish” and leaving it at that, I will tell you how bearish or how bullish on a simple scale of 0 (most bearish) to 10 (most bullish). I won’t just tell you I think the price is “cheap” or “rich”; I’ll provide 0-10 indicators and actual prices to back that up through a variety of fair value models, ranging from complex multi-factor models derived from many price-driving variables to simpler models like a P/E ratio for an equity index or relative value for a commodity. Of course markets are not concrete mathematical equations; they are the results of the actions and decisions of the billions of people on our planet and innumerable factors that are out of our control. However, having a rigorous, quantified analysis presented through an easily interpreted framework makes it a lot easier to wrap our heads around them. Lastly, I break down the markets and express my views through five core concepts, which I define as follows:  Fair Value: What’s the “right” price? Factors: What explains the price? Drivers: What’s the market paying attention to? Risk: What could happen to the price? Technical Analysis: What’s the market telling you?  Reduction Indicator: All Things Considered \\n\\nThe Reduction Indicator (RI) is my data-driven, “all things considered” indicator of bearishness/bullishness. It accounts for fundamentals, technicals, and other considerations and reports its reading on a scale of 0 (most bearish) to 10 (most bullish). The current reading of 2.7 is bearish.\\n Source: Ganalytics \\n\\n Factor: Inventories/Production Balance The most significant supply factor upsetting the market balance in crude oil has been US shale production. Led by explosive growth out of the Permian Basin, the United States has increased crude production by almost 2 million bpd in the past year alone (see above). This accounts for a majority of the overall 2.5 million bpd of growth in global liquid fuel production over the past year and has propelled the US into the top slot for global oil production. As a result, US oil inventories have swollen, and with the prolific Permian now pumping 3.5 million bpd (up 39% from a year ago), stocks at the Cushing hub have led the rise. As Cushing is the delivery location for the US benchmark (WTI crude), this has taken a serious toll on the US futures. \\n\\n The Inventories/Production Balance factor accounts for the rising US stocks and many of the other production and storage related issues already discussed. It peaked in March and started to head downwards as the oil supply/demand deficit started shrinking. It accelerated aggressively downwards when US inventories started to explode in September. Note the divergence between the I/PB factor and the crude price that began in June. While the factor was continuing to decline, crude resumed its upward march, setting up the fundamental price dislocation that sowed the seeds of the aggressive declines we’re currently experiencing.\\n Factor: Sentiment The Sentiment factor draws from a variety of sources to quantify the level of speculative and investor sentiment built into the crude market. With the global glut retreating throughout 2017 thanks to the OPEC+ production cuts, a booming global economy, and Venezuelan production plummeting, sentiment for crude oil grew to bullish extremes, peaking in early 2018. The risk-off sell-off in February caused the bulls to pare back some of their positioning, but fears of Iranian exports being removed from the market due to Trump’s sanction impositions kicked the bulls back into action. This proved to be unwise, as the supply/demand balance was already shifting towards surpluses, Russia and Saudi Arabia started to pump more, and the US eventually granted waivers for many of Iran’s oil importers. Once US inventory figures began reporting unseasonably large builds, the bulls exited en masse, and crude tumbled. \\n\\nAs can be seen from the factor’s chart and level indicator (at a very weak 0.4) above, bearish sentiment is now quite extended. Time will tell whether this is appropriate or not, but this suggests there is not much speculative ammunition left for the bears to push down crude. Given this lack of ammo, the strong technical support in the $40-42 range, and my models’ fair value estimations (discussed further below), I expect this support to hold. However, given the strongly bearish technical momentum and risk-off moves consuming the markets, I would not be surprised to see the $40-42 range tested shortly. Fair Value \\n\\nSource: Ganalytics\\nI include three factor-based models and three relative value models for my assessment of crude oil fair value. The factor-based models account for a wide variety of price-driving considerations (macroeconomics, supply/demand, etc.), while the relative value models weigh WTI crude against its historical relationships with the included assets (natural gas, Brent crude, and Dubai crude). The apparently “cheapness” of WTI versus Dubai and Brent is not surprising given the rampant US production growth and relatively large storage builds. Natural gas has too many independent dynamics and has recently spiked on winter weather fears and low amounts of gas in storage, so I’m not reading much into its relative value indicator. My primary factor-based model has viewed crude as overvalued since June, with the dislocation coinciding with the second jump in the Sentiment factor and then continuing to widen until crude’s peak in October. At this peak, the model estimated crude as overvalued by $12-13. With the recent builds in global inventories (led by the US) and deterioration in sentiment, the model has dropped along with crude, and after a five month long or so dislocation, this recent plunge has finally placed crude close to fair value. Of the $32 decline, I assign approximately $8 to the production/inventory builds, $8 to the drop in sentiment, $2-3 to other factors (e.g. USD strength), and the rest due to reversion to the model (i.e. prices were significantly over-extended). \\n\\n Where we stand, crude is nearing full convergence with my primary factor-based model, which pegs a fair price at $43.71. The “Alt 1” model uses a similar methodology with different variables/weights and sees fair value a bit lower at $41.39. My “Ex-Sent” model reports the anticipated valuation if sentiment were to return to neutral. In other words, if the speculators reverted to a neutral stance, what would the model expect the price to be? Barring any changes to the underlying fundamentals, its $49.82 valuation is a reasonable estimate for where prices may be headed should the bearish speculators close out their bets. This coincides with the psychological $50 barrier that functioned as recent support.\\n Risk: OPEC+ Production In my view, the biggest variable confronting crude prices is the production cuts from OPEC+. The recent Short-Term Energy Outlook from the EIA factors in the OPEC+ cuts and still points to a market surplus and further inventory builds next year (primarily due to continued production growth out of the US). If the projections play out, my Ex-Sent model would drop by about $6 (right in line with the current primary model’s valuation at about $43-$44). This tells me that under current projections, crude is reasonably valued at those levels. However, I believe there is an upside risk here of OPEC+ making further cuts. With the market already punishing crude and failing to blink at the agreed 1.2 million barrel cut, OPEC has already suggested further cuts would be implemented if necessary. While it’s always difficult to sort jawboning from genuine clues, I suspect that short of a Trump decision to reduce Iran sanction waivers, OPEC+ will announce further cuts, viewing prices this low as intolerable. For an additional 500 thousand bpd removed from the market one way or another, I estimate crude may rise $5-10, bringing fair value back above $50/bbl. Wrap-Up A booming global economy and over-compliance with the previous OPEC+ cuts (aided by geopolitics out of Venezuela and Iran) managed to drastically reduce the global glut of crude that dictated low prices from 2014 through 2016. In anticipation of the Iran sanctions implementation, Saudi Arabia and Russia began pumping more oil, driving sentiment for crude prices to bullish extremes. This led to a detachment of crude prices from my modeled fair values, and the data simply never caught up. The US started issuing waivers to many of Iran’s oil importers. Led by the US\\'s rampant shale growth, global inventories began to swell. This confluence of factors precipitated a dramatic drop in sentiment, and crude prices came tumbling down along with it. At present, crude is finally close to full convergence with my fair value models. We may see some more bearish follow-through as technical momentum is heavily bearish, and there is still a bit of further downside suggested by my factor-based models. Longer-term technical support is in the $40-42 range, and I expect it to hold given my models’ fair values and the lack of available bearish ammunition (thanks to sentiment and speculative positioning already at bearish extremes). I would not be surprised to see a rebound towards $50 on a paring of sentiment or outright short-squeeze, but barring additional cuts from OPEC+, a reduction of Iran sanction waivers, or some other unforeseen production disruption or pickup in demand, prices look fair in the mid $40’s. Given OPEC+’s presumed intolerance for prices at that level, I am watching closely for news or rumors about further cuts. I would expect roughly $1-2/bbl in crude price appreciation for each 100 thousand barrels removed from the market.\\n\\nDisclosure: I/we have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

Most investors were highly pessimistic about stocks in general. Accordingly, most companies operating in the life science sector were the first ones to witness their stocks tumble as evidenced by the decline in various biotechnology benchmarks. Specifically, the SPDR S&P Biotech ETF (NYSE:XBI) and the iShares NASDAQ Biotechnology ETF (NASDAQ:IBB) traded in the deep south for the aforementioned period. As market sentiment can be contagious, the pessimistic mood spread to other sectors. For instance, the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI), an index that tracks blue-chip companies in nearly all sectors, exchanged hands substantially lower than its 52-week high of 26,828 points. \\n\\n Figure 1: Key market indices and notable stocks (Source: Yahoo Finance)\\n Mixed Market Sentiment Interestingly, the DJI enjoyed a spectacular rebound the following day after Christmas. The mentioned index traded 1,086 points higher at 22,878 for over 4.9% gains. Likewise, the bioscience indices also catapulted to the similar upward trajectory. Not surprisingly, shares of many companies under our coverage like Spectrum Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ:SPPI), Regenxbio (NASDAQ:RGNX), and Crispr Therapeutics (NASDAQ:CRSP) ran with the market bulls. Aside from their strong fundamentals, it is most likely that the sentimental shift sparked their rally. Of note, we believe that stocks which depreciated significantly like the bioscience equities during late 2018 tend to appreciate most aggressively in the subsequent market upturn. Amid the unfolding events in this precarious macro-condition, we reflected on the directionality of the market going forward. It\\'s important for investors to realize that it is quite difficult to forecast markets with great precision. Warren Buffett and other gurus are unable to forecast the markets. Hence, we chose to clear a lower hurdle in our analysis by not attempting to forecast markets. Notably, we devoted our efforts in assessing the intrinsic value of many companies while gauging the overall market sentiment. Altogether, our research gave us an approximation of the magnitude of the current market opportunity. Specifically, the combinations of market sentiments and our bottom-up research helped us determine that most stocks are trading at deep bargains to their true worth. In our research process, we continually monitor different media outlets as well as the market sentiment from our private investment community, Integrated BioSci Investing. And our assessment revealed that the current market sentiment has shifted from a sense of \"extreme pessimism\" to a \"mixed sentiment.\" The positive factor that improved the market\\'s mood is the aggressive bull run that occurred after Christmas. Rapid Sentimental Shift Moreover, we believe that investors are highly sophisticated and informed nowadays due to the widespread application of the Internet that delivers information near the speed of light. Furthermore, crowdsource investment communities like Seeking Alpha also contribute to the rapid transmission of market wisdom and sentiment alike. In contrast to the bear markets in the early \\'80s, investors in this day and age are highly informed and opportunistic.\\n Instead of being fearful, many investors bargain hunt in the middle of the difficulties associated with this market downturn. And the market sentiment can propagate quickly in the investment community to encourage aggressive rallies like the one that we observed. Hence, it is likely that the market bulls will continue to run. Point Of Extreme Pessimism Ultimately, there is a good probability that the current bear market may be prematurely terminated. Additionally, this bear market can be one of the briefest downturns in the history of the stock market. Be that as it may, we believe that the point of \"extreme pessimism,\" as popularized by Sir. John Templeton, has not been reached. If the point of maximum pessimism has not reached, the market mood can turn very sour in 2019 and thereby presents much better bargain opportunities. As market pessimism is fueled by one of the most powerful human emotions, fear, it\\'s important to analyze potential stimuli that can induce market participants to panic. In our view, if the President of The United States (POTUS) Donald Trump implements imprudent trade policy and exacerbates the Trade War with China, the market will eventually go into a panic mode. Another potential catalyst is the rising strength of the U.S. dollar as well as the increasing interest rate from the Federal Reserve. A stronger dollar will discourage global trade that, in and of itself, will dampen the aggregate global gross domestic product (\"GDP\"). This is because the global economy is intertwined by individual economies of various countries. Nearly all nations have their economies influenced by global trade. And if the POTUS pushes for policies that discourage trade and export with China, it\\'s nearly certain that our economy, as well as the global economy, will suffer. In our opinion, the global economy operates at its best when there are cooperation and respect from all countries. That aside, a rising interest rate set by the Federal Reserve is most likely to hamper the real estate industry\\'s growth. Consequently, a real estate market cool-down can spread to other sectors.\\n Market Strategy Of note, market forecasting can be done by certain experts. We simply do not have the power to embark on such an endeavor. Our approach is to focus on what investors should do in either a bear or bull market. In a bull market cycle, we\\'ve been recommending investors to maintain a 40% cash position in anticipation of a bear market. With our approach, we can operate in all market cycles. And we strongly believe that the most opportunistic time to accumulate shares in high-quality stocks is during a bear market. Moreover, it is imperative to select companies that are most likely to survive a prolonged market downturn and thus thrive in the subsequent bull market cycle. Though we recommend you to take your 40% cash reserve and purchase our five-star stocks, you can carefully prune your portfolio to select only our Top Ten equities. You should also select stocks from other sectors to increase your diversification. The types of stocks you choose are not as important as your understanding of their businesses, as knowing the underlying fundamentals of equities that you purchased is a requisite to successful investing. That being said, ten equities will provide you with a reasonable level of diversification. Now if the market continues to head aggressively north, you\\'ve already positioned yourself to potentially reap multiple-fold rewards. Conversely, if the market trades lower in 2019, you can build additional stakes for an overall lower average cost. More importantly, you should hold your stocks until the subsequent bull market cycle. Potential Risks The key risk to investing in a bear market is that once you\\'ve made your investment, your stocks can continue to move further south. As fear is a powerful human emotion, it can cause investors to make rash decisions and thereby sell prematurely at a loss. Another risk is that the current bear market can be prolonged and therefore your patience will be severely tested. For investors who are waiting for the market bottom prior to making your purchase, the market sentiment can shift course rapidly. And the subsequent bull market can be prolonged which will cause you to miss out on this rare investment opportunity.\\n Final Remarks It can be a daunting task to hold your stocks when you observe their daily paper losses. Nevertheless, the fundamentals will prevail at least 91% of the times, according to the Father of Growth Investing, Philip Fisher. Therefore, it\\'s important for you to be patience, opportunistic, and have the conviction which are key ingredients to brewing multiple-fold returns for your portfolio. Last but not least, now is the time to be opportunistic because this special situation has not come since 2008.\\nAbout Integrated BioSci Investing\\nWe\\'re honored that you visited us today.

Click here to find out more »\\nDespite oil being at 17 month lows, dropping over 40% from its peak, many in the airline industry are unjustly at, or close to, their 52 week low. Also, a reduction in fuel hedging will amplify the benefit from the drop in oil prices, potentially leading EPS to be over 20% higher than recent guidance suggests. Oil as a major input cost The second largest expense for most airlines is the cost of jet fuel, the only cost higher being that of labor. As a result, oil prices can be very influential on profit margins and overall net income, making it important to consider oil prices when investing in the airline industry. The graphic below shows the inverse correlation between oil prices and overall airline industry profits. Fuel Costs and Net Profit Correlation\\n\\n As of 12/24/2018, oil hit a fresh 17 month low, down over 40% from its recent highs, meaning the second largest input cost for the airline industry has reduced as jet fuel is derived from oil. A recent example of the impact of this is seen in JetBlue. In Q3 of 2017, JetBlue paid an average of $1.69 per gallon for a total of $347 million in aircraft fuel and related taxes. Compare this to Q3 of 2018, where JetBlue paid $2.32 per gallon for a total of $515 million in aircraft fuel and related taxes. This is an increase of 48.4% in total expenditures in this category, partly from increased demand of jet fuel and party from an increase in oil prices.\\n JetBlue Q3 2018 Results\\n\\n Source: Mediaroom.jetblue.com As the chart below depicts, the price of oil is returning to the levels that it was in Q3 of 2018, if not slightly lower. As a result, the price JetBlue pays for jet fuel per gallon is likely to be even lower than it was in Q3 of 2017 ($1.69), implying over a 27% saving per gallon. If that 27% decrease were to be applied to last quarters aircraft fuel and related taxes expenditure, there would be $139 million dollars in savings, raising JetBlue\\'s EBITA from $83 million to $222 million (83 original + 139 in savings). This shows how much oil prices can impact an airlines bottom line. WTI Crude Price From 2017 to Present\\n\\n Source: Cnbc.com Airline Hedging A fuel hedge contract allows for an airline to buy options or commodity swaps. The benefits of a fuel hedge are that it enables an airline to determine the the price of their jet fuel in advance, allowing them to better plan flights and reduce fluctuation in ticket prices. Also, it protects the airline from a large upswing in the oil market, which would increase their input costs, reducing net income. Although hedging may sound like a good way to mitigate risk, it can also decrease an airline\\'s bottom line as the company must pay in order to hedge. As a result, airline companies that do not hedge will reap large rewards when oil prices tumble as they are able to purchase cheap oil, while not paying millions of dollars to hedge against higher prices.\\n A great example showing just how much it costs to hedge fuel comes was Delta in 2015. In Q1 of 2015, Delta (DAL) lost over a billion dollar in its fuel hedging portfolio when the price of oil plummeted. In 2015, Delta (DAL) ended up paying $2.40 per gallon, while American Airlines (AAL), which was not participating in a hedging program, had a per gallon price of $1.90. We are currently witnessing many airlines stop hedging as oil prices are low, such as American Airlines (AAL), United Airlines (UAL), and now even Delta (DAL) as well. Since oil prices are low, airline companies will get the best of both worlds: low oil prices and no hedging costs. Both of these will work to lower the average price per gallon of oil and drastically increase the bottom line, just as American Airlines (AAL) did in 2015. Future Outlook So, where does this leave the airlines for the future? I believe that these benefits of a drop in oil will begin to partially show up in Q4 of 2018 with a decrease in jet fuel expenditures per gallon. The average price of jet fuel thus far in Q4 of 2018, including projected fuel and transportation costs, is $2.16 compared to that of $2.30 in Q3 of 2018, a decrease of 6%. For this example, I am going to use American Airlines (AAL) as they will not be impacted by any historical hedging as they have not hedged at all during these time periods. In 2018, American Airlines (AAL) paid the following for fuel:   Time Average Price per Gallon   Q1 2018 $2.10    Q2 2018 $2.24    Q3 2018 $2.30    Q4 2018 *$2.16    *estimated based on average of jet fuel (October 1st to present) plus $.18 for fuel and transportation costs When American Airlines made estimated full year EPS during Q3 2018, they initially predicted $5.50 to $6.50 in EPS, estimating jet fuel to be around $2.22 per gallon for Q4 2018. However, following an uptick in oil, this guidance was adjusted to $5-$6, then finally to $4.50-$5. The large drop in oil means that investors can expect to see earnings above the original estimation of $5.50-$6.50 as that EPS was based on a $2.22 per gallon, an over 20% increase in EPS than the most recent guidance of $4.50-$5.50.\\n As a result, the EPS for American Airlines, among other airlines, will improve. Let\\'s say we go very conservative and estimate American Airlines\\' EPS is towards the lower end of its range at $5.50. This is conservative considering jet fuel will be lower per gallon than the original guidance took into account. Also, $5.50 was even the low end of that projection. With EPS of $5.50, American Airlines would have an P/E of 5.87 (Current price as of 12/27 is $32.29), which would be historically low for American Airlines (AAL). For reference, P/E of American Airlines in January of 2018 reached close to 12. American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL) is just one of the many airlines that will see such a boost to the bottom line as a result of lower jet fuel prices, causing a great reduction in airline companies\\' P/E ratios. Risks According to American Airlines, \"Our business is very dependent on the price and availability of aircraft fuel. Continued periods of high volatility in fuel costs, increased fuel prices or significant disruptions in the supply of aircraft fuel could have a significant negative impact on our operating results and liquidity.\" It wouldn\\'t be fair to say that my thesis is foolproof because it is not. There is always a chance a large spike in oil prices could occur, leading negative results. Additionally, the reduction or total stoppage of hedging could act as a double-edged sword, brutally punishing airline companies by potentially making them face to full brunt of higher jet fuel prices. That being said, my thesis is based on what has already occurred and the prices that currently exist. Based on this information, it is quite clear that the market is undervaluing the quantitative boost many airlines will receive to their bottom line as a result of this selloff. Conclusion Jet fuel is a very important factor in determining the profitability of any company in the airline industry. Normally a company\\'s second largest cost is around 20-33% of total costs. When jet fuel prices are low, airlines become much more profitable, as the price for each gallon of fuel becomes much cheaper. Some companies use hedging to reduce the impact that rising oil prices can have; however, it can easily backfire when oil prices slip, as it did with Delta in 2015, causing an over billion dollar loss. As a result, many companies have stopped, or greatly reduced, the amount that they hedge. That being said, these companies that stopped hedging are currently getting the best of both worlds. First, they no longer have to spend millions of dollars on a hedging program. Second, they reap the benefits of larger profit margins, due to one of their largest input costs being much less expensive. All in all, the drastic decline in oil will lead airlines to beat recent EPS guidance by a large margin, push P/E ratios lower, and create a buying opportunity for a potential airline investor.\\n\\nDisclosure: I/we have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

But in the time since U.S. stocks have descended into free fall with the headline benchmark S&P 500 Index momentarily grazing what many consider bear market territory at down -20%. While stocks may soon rally strongly and quickly erase much if not all of the recent declines in value in the coming weeks, the events of the fourth quarter of 2018 cannot be undone, as they are likely foreshadowing what could become a very challenging year ahead in 2019.  \\n\\n “So don't fear if you hear A foreign sound to your ear It's alright, Ma, I'm only sighing” - It’s Alright, Ma (I’m Only Bleeding), Bob Dylan, 1965 Sigh: It would feel more exasperating if it were not for the so many numbing years that brought us to this point. Stock investors today are likely in the very early stages of what could potentially be the most challenging decade of investing that they have seen in their lifetimes.\\n Why? Because we have been left with a U.S. stock market as we enter 2019 that has been driven to its current state voluntarily by policy makers that have spent nearly a decade keeping interest rates perpetually low, injecting roughly $15 trillion in central bank liquidity into the financial system, cutting taxes, and encouraging governments and corporations around the globe to accumulate record amounts of debt relative to their underlying output and capitalizations all with the misguided objective of fostering a “wealth effect” that was supposed to contribute in freeing us from the burdens left by the financial crisis and creating an environment of sustainable economic growth. This grand experiment was untested. And unfortunately, it has proven ineffective in achieving its intended outcome. Instead, we are left with a global economy that remains mired in sluggish growth despite continuously extraordinary policy support. Along the way, the accumulated “wealth effect” generated by these misguided policies has created a massive income and wealth gap where a selected few have been winners while the remaining masses were largely left behind. The resulting frustration is leading to increasing social unrest in many parts of the world that includes an increasing shift toward nationalism and inserting outsiders from both extremes of the political spectrum into positions of power. “While money doesn't talk, it swears” - It’s Alright, Ma (I’m Only Bleeding), Bob Dylan, 1965 Unrest: Put simply, both capitalism and democracy are increasingly under fire as we enter 2019. Yet the masters that make the rules for the wise men and the fools remain painfully slow to waking up to this reality, as they seek to continue imposing the same policies that have brought us to this point. One has to look no further to European Union leadership in Brussels to see how this phenomenon is playing out. Europe is a continent that is not moving toward greater union. Instead, it is one that is increasingly splintering in a manner last seen more than eight decades ago in the 1930s. As for the state of democracy, it is trending toward greater autocracy in many countries around the world including the abolishment of term limits among other developments.\\n Such are not the conditions supportive of endless stock market gains in coming years. Instead, these are the foundations of greater volatility. It didn’t have to be this way, but here we are today nonetheless. “Advertising signs that con you Into thinking you're the one That can do what's never been done That can win what's never been won Meantime life outside goes on All around you” - It’s Alright, Ma (I’m Only Bleeding), Bob Dylan, 1965 Complacency: Sure, it has been a difficult few months to close out 2018. But the stock market is likely soon to rally. It is long overdue to do so at this point. And the beginning of this rebound may have already come to pass on Wednesday with a remarkable +5% rally on the S&P 500 Index followed by a late day save on Thursday to tack on another +1%. Undoubtedly, if this recovery trend continues, many stock investors will shake off the challenges of the past few months and resume their bullish ways. Why shouldn’t they? We are still in the midst of one of the longest bull markets in history (my apologies, but barely dipping below the -20% down threshold on an intraday basis in the midst of a three month market decline does not qualify as the end of a bull market and the start of a new “bear market”). And time and time again, over the past decade, investors have been conditioned to buy any and all dips in riding their favorite stocks or stock indices to new all-time highs. If you are an investor under the age of 35, or came to stock investing in the last ten years, you simply do not know anything different. But alack and alas, this false sense of security is precisely how so many investors find themselves unwittingly trapped in the jowls of a real bear market, which is an increasingly challenging market environment that repeatedly and relentlessly frustrates and whipsaws investors into submission over the course of many months if not a few years or more. “You lose yourself, you reappear You suddenly find you got nothing to fear Alone you stand with nobody near\\n When a trembling distant voice, unclear Startles your sleeping ears to hear That somebody thinks they really found you” - It’s Alright, Ma (I’m Only Bleeding), Bob Dylan, 1965 Fear: U.S. stock investors have good reason to be afraid as we enter 2019. Let’s first consider the economic indicators beyond the recent sharp drop in the S&P 500 Index and the associated sustained rise in the CBOE Volatility Index, or the VIX, that are signaling potential trouble ahead. These include the recent plunge in the NAHB/Wells Fargo Housing Market Index, a Treasury yield curve that recently inverted on the short end in the 1-Year to 5-Year segment of the curve and remains precariously close to inversion through the intermediate and long end of the curve, and forward inflation expectations that were already below the Fed’s 2% target rate and are once again streaking back to the downside. Let’s also revisit that foreign sound in our ears for a different perspective on what the year ahead might bring. Riddle me the following. Has the economic experience in the United States since the outbreak of the financial crisis more than eleven years ago been that much better than the rest of the developed world that it justifies a doubling of the S&P 500 Index on a dividend adjusted basis versus developed international stocks trading no higher today on a dividend adjusted basis than they were before this whole mess started in 2007? \\n\\n And has the economic experience been similarly better than the emerging world to lead to the same double versus nothing outcome? \\n\\n\\n Or is virtually the only reason that U.S. stocks have doubled over the past eleven years while the rest of the world has languished because of the positive spillover effects associated with trillions of dollars of central bank liquidity injections and trillions of dollars of share repurchases from corporations that have been feasting at the trough of low-cost borrowing? Stock price inflation, after all, was a stated goal of then Fed Chair Ben Bernanke when it was decided more than eight years ago now that having saved the global financial system was simply not enough. Impossible, you might exclaim. It’s had to be more than central bank liquidity and buybacks! Perhaps, but consider the following. Since January 1, 2014, the U.S. stock market as measured by the S&P 500 Index has risen by nearly +50%. Up until the recent correction, it had been higher by as much at +75% over this nearly five-year time period. These are absolutely fantastic returns over such a short time period for the largest stock market on the planet. \\n\\n Presumably, for stocks to have risen so much over the last five years, investor demand for owning stocks must have outstripped supply by a considerable margin. After all, this is a basic fundamental principle we all learned in ECON 101 that should drive prices higher. Yet when we look back over the past five years, we see the exact opposite has been playing out all along the way. Instead of demand fueled investors pouring money into U.S. stock mutual funds and ETFs, investors have been draining money out of U.S. stocks to the tune of nearly a quarter of a trillion dollars. Put more simply, investors have been consistently selling more stocks than they have been buying over the past five years, yet stock prices have increased by +50% to +75% over this same time period.\\n \\n\\n This doesn’t add up. If it’s not investors that have been buying stocks all along the way, support for stock prices has had to come from somewhere else. And the most likely suspects are the central bank liquidity and corporate stock buybacks cited above. All of this leads to a critical problem for the U.S. stock market as we enter 2019. Stocks are still trading at a meaningful historical premium relative to their underlying earnings on both a trailing twelve-month (15% premium) and cyclically adjusted ten-year basis (75% premium) even after the latest bear market grazing correction. Global central banks spent the past year increasingly shutting off the liquidity spigots while at the same time opening the drain by roughly $1 trillion in 2018, with the pace of liquidity withdrawals set to accelerate even further in 2019. And corporations that have spent the last six quarters pouring a record obliterating total of nearly $1 trillion into share repurchases at prices that are now on average measurably above where these same shares are trading today (nothing like allocating on behalf of shareholders what could have otherwise been productive capital to buying at historical peak valuations in the stock market – awesome!). At the same time, concerns are mounting that we may be headed toward a global economic slowdown and a U.S. recession in the coming year, which is a surefire way to bring corporate stock buyback programs to a screeching halt the same way it has in the past. Put all of these above factors together, and the mirage that has long been the U.S. stock market is at threat of being fully revealed in the coming year. If the U.S. stock market does nothing more than catch down to the reality that the rest of the world has been reflecting continuously over the past decade, it implies the potential for as much as a -50% decline in value if not more on the S&P 500 Index on top of what has already been sustained since the late September 2018 peak. It should be noted that this decline if it were to come to pass would not likely be felt all at once in 2019. Instead because policy makers will likely not be able to help themselves to try and stem the decline, it is likely to take place over the course of a few if not several years into the early 2020s. This is the long, agonizing bear market scenario I have discussed in the past that is increasingly coming into focus as potentially getting underway as we enter 2019.\\n Impossible, you might exclaim once again. The fundamentals remain too strong to justify such a downside move as we enter 2019. And at present, such protestations would be absolutely correct. Despite weakening among some economic signals, various other current economic readings remain strong. And corporate earnings growth is still robust at a double-digit rate and is projected to continue into 2019 (of course, corporate earnings growth at Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) is still robust at a double-digit rate, yet the stock has fallen by as much as -44% since July). But if history is any guide, such positive current readings on the economy and the corporate earnings outlook can turn south in a flash. And if current GAAP earnings on the S&P 500 Index declined back from the $130 to $140 range today to $100 per share over the course of the next year in the midst of a recession onset scenario at some point over the next couple of years (a totally reasonable possibility given that it was as low as $86 per share as recently as early 2016), and investors assigned a lower 14 times multiple to the U.S. stock market, which is also reasonable given that this is not that far below its historical average at around 16 times earnings and still well above historical lows down at 5 to 6 times. This would bring the S&P 500 Index back to 1,400 and would represent a more than -50% decline from its recent all-time highs. I’m not saying it will happen, but it is also a possibility that cannot be ruled out either. Maybe the liquidity spigots will once again flow freely in 2019 with the Fed once again rushing to the rescue. Maybe U.S. stocks will regain their footing and soar to new all-time highs in the coming year. Absolutely nothing can be ruled out in the post crisis period, particularly when it comes to stock prices going up and defying any and all reasonable expectations in the process. As a result, maintaining at least some measure of an allocation to U.S. equities remains prudent. My preference in the current market environment remains a concentration in U.S. large cap value equities with an emphasis on defensive consumer staples, healthcare, and utilities as well as financials. Why U.S. large cap value? Not only has the category traditionally offered a rate of return that is competitive with the various other size and style categories in the U.S. stock market place, but it has done so with the lowest price volatility and thus the highest Sharpe ratio over time.\\n Moreover, and perhaps more importantly, the relative underperformance of value versus growth has been unprecedented by orders of magnitude in recent years. Given that value and growth have generated comparable rates of return over long-term periods of time with a slight advantage to value coupled with the fact that I am a strong believer in mean reversion over time, the coming year may be primed for value to finally take its overdue leadership over from growth once again. Under such an assumption, the potential exists for U.S. large cap value stocks to continue to climb even if the growth side of the market pulls the broader index into bear market territory just as value stocks did for much of the tech bubble bursting period from mid 2000 to early 2002. Nonetheless, investors must recognize that risks for the U.S. stock market are tilted heavily to the downside. Now is not the time as we enter 2019 to give in to complacency or relying on a plain vanilla stock index strategy to light your way. Instead, investors must maintain a close watch and be at the ready to act nimbly if necessary along the way. For example, stock investors that may wished to sell should be targeting levels on the S&P 500 Index such as 2,661 and 2,749 to consider exiting positions on the margins (in other words, don’t sell all of your stocks at once. Instead, sell those that you favor the least and continue to hold the rest). And also know as we enter 2019 that stock market lows are made to be retested. Expect that now may not be the last time that we see 2,346 on the S&P 500 Index. The same may also be said of 1,810 on the S&P 500 Index from February 2016 before it is all said and done over the next few years, but only time will tell in this regard. \\n\\n\\n “A question in your nerves is lit Yet you know there is no answer fit to satisfy” - It’s Alright, Ma (I’m Only Bleeding), Bob Dylan, 1965 Question: The potential downside risk for the U.S. stock market raises a natural question. Perhaps allocating stock portfolios to developed international or emerging markets makes better sense as we enter 2019? The answer here from the perspective of this analyst is a decisive NO. While U.S. stock investors are confronted with challenges as we enter 2019, I would contend that the outlook is even more treacherous abroad. Economic and geopolitical conditions are becoming increasingly fragile in many parts of the world, and these problems may only compound on themselves in the coming year. It is important to note that while the U.S. stock market has been struggling as of late, both the MSCI EAFE and Emerging Market indices have been steadily falling all year. This has been happening for good reason. And these markets are collectively also trading at a meaningful relative discount to the U.S. for good reason. \\n\\n \\n\\n Remember prognostications for a globally synchronized growth revolution in 2018? Turns out, not so much. Despite the accumulating downside risks facing the broader U.S. stock market, it remains a market of stocks where individual holdings that offer sustainable free cash flow growth and attractive valuations can be readily invested in (not traded, but invested in), forgoing the currency risk and focusing on identifying selected names and segments of the U.S. market to allocate offers a more attractive prospect at the present time than trying to venture overseas.\\n Instead, those seeking an alternative should look not to cross geographic boundaries with their stock allocations but instead should be considering crossing asset class boundaries into new strategies other than stocks. “And though the rules of the road have been lodged It's only people's games that you got to dodge And it's alright, Ma, I can make it.” - It’s Alright, Ma (I’m Only Bleeding), Bob Dylan, 1965 Making it: I am downcast at the long-term outlook for stocks over the coming years. But this does not mean that capital markets in general are not flush with upside returns opportunities going forward. It is important to emphasize a point that so many investors are given to overlook. Investing is not an endeavor that is a binary choice between owning stocks or sitting in cash. Instead, capital markets offer a wide range of securities stretching across a broad range of asset classes that have varying degrees of positive or negative correlation with stocks including those that have essentially no correlation whatsoever. Investors should always remember that stocks are just one small part of a vast investment opportunity set universe. And when looking ahead to 2019, I remain decidedly bullish on a number of asset classes outside of stocks. Leading the list heading into 2019 is long-term U.S. Treasuries. While I am bearish on spread product in the fixed income space such as both investment grade and high yield corporate bonds, I am bullish on long-term U.S. Treasuries. Why long-term U.S. Treasuries? A few key reasons. First, while stocks benefit from an accelerating economy, safe haven U.S. Treasuries benefit from a decelerating economy. And if the U.S. economy is slowing into recession, long-term U.S. Treasuries stand to benefit as investors move to lock in long-term rates ahead of any future Fed easing cycle. Second, while Treasury yields remain historically low on an absolute basis, they offer attractive upside on a relative basis over the next few years. Long-term U.S. Treasury yields spent just over two years steadily rising from lows below 1.40% in the summer of 2016 to highs near 3.25% just a few months ago driven by expectations of sustained economic growth that it turns out appears increasingly unlikely to materialize. If we subsequently start slowing toward recession over the coming year, this implies the potential for Treasury yields to fall back to their 2016 lows if not further. Such a move would imply +15% upside price appreciation alone on an exchange traded fund like the widely traded iShares 20+ Year Treasury Bond (TLT). Throw in respectable monthly coupon payments along the way, and this holding has the makings of providing attractive returns for an investment portfolio going forward.\\n \\n\\n Lastly, the primary threat to long-term U.S. Treasuries is the prospect of sustainably higher inflation. Thus, the fact that inflation expectations are plunging as evidenced in the chart below, this is decidedly bullish for the category. \\n\\n But what about the fact that the Fed remains determined to raise interest rates in 2019? Even if the Fed does manage two more rate hikes in 2019, it is important to remind that the impact of Fed rate hikes is felt primarily on the short end of the yield curve. As for the long end, a variety of other forces are also at work beyond what the Fed may be doing at any given point in time. But what about the ballooning Federal debt and massive budget deficits in the United States. Quite honestly, the fiscal state of our country today causes me great consternation. And blame for the ever growing fiscal imbalances we are facing today extend evenly across both sides of the political aisle. But as the other global safe haven in Japan continues to extraordinarily demonstrate, the bounds of fiscal recklessness can apparently be stretched to unimaginable extremes before the market will begin to rebel. Eventually, we will face a day of reckoning, but in the meantime, the U.S. maintains its status as a safe haven. Let’s move on. Another asset class category that I favor in 2019 is gold. Not for a disproportionately large portfolio allocation, mind you, but something in the neighborhood of 5% for those investors that have the risk tolerance, given the price volatility associated with owning the yellow metal.\\n Why gold? A few reasons. First, after a few incredibly tough years from 2013 to 2015, gold finally bottomed at the end of 2015 and has been slowly making its way back to the upside. \\n\\n Also, while gold’s role as an inflation hedge is waning as 5-year breakevens plunge to the downside, gold’s dual identity as a recession/crisis hedge starts to kick in. For if a future economic slowdown results in increased currency volatility or geopolitical instability, gold stands to benefit beyond any short-term liquidity induced jolts. Lastly, some traditional gold investors had departed the asset class in recent years drawn by the allure of the cryptocurrency market. But as this bubble continues to painfully unwind, these same investors are bound to make their way back from this still pioneering supposed store of value in the likes of Bitcoin to the barbarous relic that has served as a store of value for thousands of years. And even if the cryptocurrency market eventually finds its footing and starts to establish its legitimacy as a true and widespread medium of exchange at some point in the coming years, precious metals such as gold could very well be part of this cryptocurrency 2.0 phase in providing the much needed value to back these currencies. \\n\\n Heading into 2019, gold has done well in establishing a “U” shaped bottom following a China induced summer swoon. The yellow metal has already gained nearly +10% over the same time that the U.S. stock market has been dropping by roughly -20% in the fourth quarter of 2018, and this trend may continue into 2019 even if stocks finally start to fight their way back.\\n The strong performance of both long-term U.S. Treasuries and gold during the fourth quarter of 2018 at a time when stocks have been cratering highlight the appeal of these categories as we head into 2019. To this point, consider the correlation of daily returns on a 60 trading day rolling basis dating back over the last 15 years from the S&P 500 Index (SPY), the TLT, and gold (GLD). SPY versus TLT: -0.41 SPY versus GLD: +0.03 TLT versus GLD: +0.11 How to read these numbers? Correlation is a reading that runs from -1.00 to 0.00 to +1.00. A reading close to +1.00 implies high positive returns correlation. In other words, when two securities are highly positively correlated with a reading greater than +0.60, when one goes up (down) the other is also likely to go up (down). A reading close to -1.00 implies high negative returns correlation. In other words, when two securities are highly negatively correlated with a reading greater than -0.60, when one goes up (down) the other is likely to go down (up). From a portfolio diversification perspective, the most desirable securities to own are those that are generally more uncorrelated with each other with readings between -0.60 and +0.60 with 0.00 implying no correlation. Why? Because when two securities are uncorrelated, when one goes up (down) the other may go up or down, as it is effectively doing its own thing. If one can build a portfolio with various elements that are uncorrelated with each other and effectively doing their own thing, and each of these individual various elements has favorable positive total returns prospects in its own right, then such is an ideal outcome from an expected future returns and risk control perspective. And such is the blend that the likes of U.S. stocks, long-term U.S. Treasuries, and gold offer in today’s market. Long-term U.S. Treasuries and gold are just two of the various attractive upside opportunities heading into 2019 that are available across the vast capital markets spectrum. “While preachers preach of evil fates\\n Teachers teach that knowledge waits Can lead to hundred-dollar plates Goodness hides behind its gates But even the president of the United States Sometimes must have to stand naked.” - It’s Alright, Ma (I’m Only Bleeding), Bob Dylan, 1965 Risks: Many of the economic and market risks heading into 2019 are well documented. Thus, with the interest of trying to add value, I would like to focus on two potential risks for 2019 that may be understated or not yet discussed to my knowledge. Unfortunately, both downside risks are tied to the political realm, which is often a necessary area to navigate, given how influential fiscal and monetary policy is on the economy and financial markets. With this in mind, I feel obliged to state my typical disclaimers. My intent here is not to engage in a political debate. Instead, it is to simply consider potential outcomes and their implications on the economy and financial markets. With that being said, let’s begin. The first risk I would place in the understated category. It has surfaced in the news recently that discussions have taken place surrounding current U.S. Federal Reserve Chair Powell and his potentially being terminated from his position. It has been indicated that a primary factor that has sparked these discussions is the fact that the U.S. stock market has fallen by as much as -20% over the past three months. Before going any further, it is important to put this into context. The U.S. stock market as measured by the S&P 500 Index has more than quintupled in rising by over +430% over the last 117 months since bottoming in March 2009. As discussed above, a primary reason for this stratospheric rise has been extraordinarily accommodative monetary policy. Over the past 3 months, the S&P 500 Index has fallen by as much as -20% as the Fed is prudently working to withdraw this extraordinary monetary policy accommodation. Still nearly higher by quintuple since the March 2009 lows even after the recent sell-off. I will put it this way. While I have strongly disagreed with the policies of the U.S. Federal Reserve over much of the past decade, I still believe it remains critically important that this monetary policy body remains fully independent and free from political influence. Given that the U.S. is the largest economy and financial market in the world as well as the keeper of the global reserve currency, the stability of our markets including the institutions that oversee them is critically important in maintaining the world order in financial markets. While I am not naïve in recognizing that political leaders over the years have acted to varying degrees and in varying ways (LBJ anyone?) to influence those leading the Federal Reserve, if we have a Fed Chair that is terminated from their role primarily over the short-term volatility of stock prices at any given point in time, this has the potential to be meaningfully and potentially irrevocably destabilizing to global financial market confidence. And this is an outcome to which we must now assign a measurable probability as we move into 2019.\\n While I constantly preach that changes in portfolio strategy should be made at the margins (i.e. make only modest and incremental changes to a portfolio strategy at any point in time), were moves made to abruptly remove Fed Chair Powell from his position at any point over the coming year, such an outcome would warrant a more meaningful and pronounced shift in portfolio allocations to be carried out over a relatively short period of time. While I continue to assign this a low probability, the magnitude of the potential downside associated with such an outcome cannot be overstated. The second risk comes from the not yet widely discussed category. A major FBI investigation has been ongoing for the last couple of years now. And it has been widely speculated that a final report from this investigation may be issued as soon as early 2019. While the outcome of this investigation may show that absolutely no wrongdoing took place by those that currently lead the executive branch of the U.S. government, it is also possible that this final report could reveal major and potentially incriminating infractions. Only time will tell. Suppose the latter is the ultimate outcome. Once again, it may not be, but given that a measurable probability can be assigned to this outcome, it warrants consideration in the context of its implications for financial markets. Suppose the findings from the FBI investigation are sufficiently decisive that members from both sides of the political aisle agree in determining that further action is required as stated in Article II, Section 4 of the U.S. Constitution. A hallmark of this nation has been the peaceful transition of power. This includes August 9, 1974, when President Richard Nixon departed the South Lawn of the White House on Marine One for the last time. But what if under the above stated scenario, the current President decides to stay and fight his case out to the bitter end, particularly if it becomes apparent that a Gerald Ford style full pardon may not await in the aftermath of any future departure? And what if the current President maintains sufficient vociferous support from a dedicated segment of the American public that helps to justify his staying to fight? What then?\\n While financial markets, including U.S. stocks, have traditionally shown great resilience in calmly navigating through periods of great political uncertainty throughout history, how markets might respond to a potentially prolonged and contentious Constitutional crisis of this manner is an unknown. Thus, any such political developments on this front regardless of the outcome should be closely monitored in the year ahead. Again, I would assign an even lower probability of such an outcome in this case, but it is both measurable enough and sufficiently unprecedented that it warrants advance consideration from a downside risk perspective. “But it's alright, Ma, it's life, and life only.” - It’s Alright, Ma (I’m Only Bleeding), Bob Dylan, 1965 The bottom line: If the U.S. stock market seemed irrational over the past decade, it may seem like nothing compared to what potentially lies ahead over the next few years. But we as investors are not bound to passive index strategies and simply following the course of the stock market. Such an approach may have worked well in recent years, but it is already becoming less so as 2018 draws to a close and may become even more pronounced as we move through 2019 and beyond. And those investors that employ active management and exercise their freedom and choice to act rationally and pursue attractive upside investment return opportunities in a market that may end up becoming increasingly irrational all around them should be rewarded in the end. Such a path is not without its challenges and gut checks along the way, but nobody should have ever thought that investing in capital markets was easy. And as a quick recap from the perspective of this investor as we head into 2019, stock allocations should be focused on the U.S. large cap value segment of the market with a particular emphasis on companies from the consumer staples, healthcare, utilities, and financials sectors. Investors should also be well served to look beyond the stock market with a majority of their overall portfolio allocation, as a number of categories are poised to perform well in an environment of elevated stock market volatility. These include long-term U.S. Treasuries and gold among a number of others. Lastly, investors should be encouraged to hold a meaningful allocation to cash as we head into 2019, particularly since many cash accounts are now offering respectable income for the first time in years.\\n It promises to be an eventful 2019 ahead.

More than 1,500 people were injured and many were hospitalized as a result. There was no forewarning of the meteor\\'s arrival. Fortunately, the explosion did not occur above a major city or the damage could have been catastrophic. While we are told that thousands of meteors strike the Earth each year, most are much smaller and fall in sparsely populated regions. Yet the message is clear: A major meteor strike can happen at any time with little or no warning. For the past year, I have been asked what could possibly affect our projections for the economy and the Fed\\'s rate path. I have consistently pointed to the high risk of exogenous shocks, especially given the seemingly endless policy risks around trade and foreign policy. Each presidential tweet offered another meteor, with the risk that a large one could eventually strike. The past month has provided not just a meteor or two but a virtual storm. It is difficult to list all the bad news, or which meteor was the source of the recent market explosion. Was it collapsing oil prices, in part the result of White House pressure for OPEC production increases while at the same time U.S. output continued its unabated rise? Perhaps it was the sudden crack in credit markets when investment grade bonds issued by the likes of GE and PG&E unexpectedly collapsed in price? Perhaps the world suddenly awoke to the risks of a global trade war? Maybe the Cassandra chorus of famous investors highlighting dangers associated with QE-induced overleveraging of corporate balance sheets suddenly exposed the 800-pound gorilla that I had thought we all knew was already sitting in the room.\\n By the time the Federal Reserve met last week it was clear the market was holding on to the hope that a reassuring voice of reason would let us all know that the policymakers were ready to step in if the storm got too bad. After a tepid promise that only \"some\" rate increases were in the tightening pipeline led to an initial selloff, market participants seemed prepared to give the Fed the benefit of the doubt and stocks began to rise again. Then BANG! Another meteor out of the blue! The balance sheet was on \"autopilot.\" What happened to \"data dependence\"? Fed policymakers had been clear in the past, assuring investors that the balance sheet was a tool that could be used to adjust policy, but that option now seemed to disappear. This was just too much! I am highly sympathetic to Chairman Powell\\'s circumstances. Last Wednesday\\'s meeting was perhaps the trickiest I can recall in my career. In the wake of the turmoil of the preceding weeks the situation was delicate. With an economy expanding above potential and well past full employment, clearly rates need to be increased further to get closer to neutral. To deliver the necessary medicine, the Fed would certainly know that the patient would be sensitive given recent volatility. The language in the policy statement and related press conference would require the Fed to thread a fine needle. Clearly, it failed. New York Fed President Williams did a commendable job last Friday after the FOMC meeting making it clear that \"autopilot\" may have been a poor choice of words. Certainly, the Fed would act responsibly and would use all tools as necessary and appropriate. But, let\\'s face it, the damage had been done. Any hope of restoring order was gone, especially as the meteor shower kept coming. Say goodbye to Secretary of Defense Mattis, who many say was the “last adult in the room.” And then another big explosion! The threat that Chairman Powell may be gone! An attack on the sanctity of central bank independence was probably worse than the risk that Powell would actually be removed as chairman.\\n No doubt there is more volatility to come and with holiday-dampened liquidity. I don\\'t see many investors willing to step in to buy especially given that so many were caught offside. I am quick to remind people that the recent events are exactly what we had expected—but we had expected it late next year, not now. Those investors who got underweight risk early were punished with subpar performance relative to their peers while other investors chose to linger a while longer at the punch bowl as the party went on. Now the punch bowl crowd is caught with too much risk which they are desperately trying to offload. The exogenous event is upon us. What should be done? Don\\'t panic! While risk assets may be vulnerable to more downside, liquidity is returning to the markets. What would have been a normal seasonal correction has turned into the worst December sell-off in equities since the Great Depression. Now is the time to be adding risk to portfolios. Is this the bear market? I doubt it. This looks a lot like a late expansion correction similar to the Asian Crisis in 1998. Then stocks fell by 15 percent. The Fed will be quick to rescue markets if stocks continue to fall from their highs. Policymakers haven\\'t the stomach to watch this dislocation turn into a systemic crisis. When will they step in? A continued slide in risk assets that pushes stocks down by close to 20 percent from recent highs should be enough. Will this lead to a recession in 2019? No. We do not have a single recession signal from our proprietary indicators. If we see three successive declines in monthly leading economic indicators, that would be a warning that recession is possibly imminent. Four months would probably seal the deal.What about Treasurys? The current flight to safety is likely to reverse soon. It is probably too late to buy now. T-bills would be a safe haven offering a reasonable return. When all is said and done, the current risk-off volatility should probably be welcomed. And just as there is usually a seasonal cold snap preceding winter, it is usually followed by a period of Indian summer. If I\\'m right about a return in confidence, which would likely be aided by a pause in Fed rate hikes or even an unexpected temporary rate reduction, then there could be another selling opportunity once prices stabilize.\\n Of course, there is still a lot of chaos in the world, both here at home and overseas in China and Europe. Another meteor could strike at any moment. I trust that the Fed stands ready to do what it takes to avoid calamity.

The company, thus, became the first large miner with operations in the country to react to the measure. The layoffs will be implemented in phases in the first quarter of 2019 and will be equally split between the two mines. FQVLF Director of Operations Matt Pascall denied allegations that the company is using arm-twisting tactics to oppose the new tax measures, but I find it hard to see the move as anything else. Pascall claims that the company has been doing everything possible to reduce costs at the Sentinel operation which mines ore at just 0.5%, the lowest in Zambia, but that the only remaining avenue is reducing the tonnage throughput. This is because it would no longer be economically viable to continue to run Sentinel at full capacity once the new tax measures take effect. FQVLF estimates that the new General Sales Tax is likely to increase its costs by at least 20% on procured items. Kansanshi and Sentinel operations The two projects together account for around 80% of FQVLF's copper production with close to 120,000 tonnes. Also, the company has a smelter at Kansanshi, which closed the third quarter of 2018 with a quarterly record of 90kt of copper anode: \\n\\n\\n Source: First Quantum FQVLF is currently the largest individual taxpayer in Zambia and its mines account for more than half of the country's copper production. The Zambia Chamber of Mines has forecast production of 820,000 metric tons for 2018. Overall, FQVLF is operating at pretty good margins although unit costs have been increasing over the past quarters: \\n\\n Source: First Quantum The new taxes In September, Zambia announced that it planned to increase the mineral royalty rates by 1.5%, introduce a fourth-tier rate at 10% when the copper price exceeds $7,500 per tonne, and make royalties on minerals non-deductible for tax purposes. The new taxes are aimed at reducing the country's mounting debts as the IMF has put on hold talk about an aid package due to them. At the end of 2017, Zambia's external debt stood at $8.7 billion and Moody's warned that the country risks losing national assets over Chinese debt. The situation is critical for Zambia and I think that the government sees higher mining taxes as a low-hanging fruit which it can easily pick to fix some of its problems. Mining tax revenues in the country are expected to come in at $800 million in 2017 and the government expects them to soar to $1.3 billion in 2018. However, the Chamber of Mines is not as optimistic and expects the number to stand at just $840 million next year. Furthermore, it argues that over half of the copper mines in the country would probably become unprofitable due to the new taxes which would put thousands of jobs at risk. Obviously, the government and the Chamber of Mines are on opposing sides and I think that the 2019 mining tax revenues will probably be somewhere between their respective estimates. As a whole, I think that the government is playing a very dangerous game considering that copper accounts for more than 70% of Zambia's foreign-exchange earnings. A misstep by the government could turn a debt crisis into a financial meltdown. For example, the Chamber has warned that the new taxes could result in over 21,000 jobs lost and some $500 million in capital spending cuts.\\n Tax dispute between Zambia and First Quantum From the government's point of view, mining companies have enjoyed generous tax concessions for many years and have abused tax legislation and concessions through transfer pricing abuse, under-reporting of production values, debt payments abuse, and hedging manipulation. In March 2018, the government made international headlines when it hit First Quantum with an $8 billion tax bill over unpaid import duties. It claims that the company has been classifying imported goods as mining machinery, which attract no custom duty. This tax bill and the new taxes are critical issues for First Quantum as its' very heavily indebted. While the company still has a lot of liquidity at its disposal, the real danger lies in the net debt/EBITDA covenant ratio which will be undoubtedly seriously affected: \\n\\n Source: First Quantum Conclusion I think that the government of Zambia and First Quantum are playing a dangerous game of chicken in which the company just raised the stakes with the planned layoffs. While 2,500 people might not be that much for the country's economy, you have to take into account that according to estimates the average Zambian miner has eight dependents. This means that the layoffs will affect around 20,000 people and this is just one company. The situation could become much drier for Zambia if other major miners follow FQVLF's example. And if the estimate that more than half of copper mines will become unprofitable due to the new taxes is true, then it's only a matter of time. As a whole, I think that the government is more likely to blink first and repeal, delay or soften the new taxes (just like it happened in South Africa), but then again, we are talking about politicians which aren't known as logical people. In any case, First Quantum can't afford to lose this as the new taxes will be a hard blow for its debt covenants and the company has over $6 billion of loans maturing over the next years.\\n Also, First Quantum has to resolve its tax bill issue as this is also beginning to bite it in a major way. According to news portal Miningmx, some $392m in value-added tax had been unpaid by Zambia to the company, of which $262m related to Kansanshi. I think that things might get worse for First Quantum before getting better.\\nDisclosure: I/we have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

S.', 'about': ['<span id=\"about_primary_stocks\"><a href=\"/symbol/EPI\" title=\"WisdomTree India Earnings ETF\" sasource=\"article_primary_about\">WisdomTree India Earnings ETF (EPI)</a></span>'], 'theme': ['<div class=\"a-themes\"><span id=\"theme link\"><a href=\"/etfs-and-funds/etf-analysis\" sasource=\"theme_breadcrumb\">ETF Analysis</a></span></div>'], 'summary': ['The WisdomTree India Earnings Fund is an exchange traded fund providing investors access to a Indian companies.Quick look at the reasons for investing in India.Discussion of the fund and its performance and whether it makes sense for your portfolio.'], 'article': ['\\n\\n As I discussed in my last article on the iShares India ETF (INDA), I do not consider myself an expert on India. I do however see a real need to have Indian exposure based on the country\\'s demographics.  India is today the 5th largest economy in the world and is expected to double to $5 trillion by 2025. The country is a leader in producing highly educated engineers who are creating a thriving tech economy. In fact, the Harvard Business School states that India\\'s educational institutions produce more engineers than China and the United States combined! Beyond the large and growing educated workforce, the country presents a $5 trillion investment opportunity in infrastructure spending urgently needed to supporting the grow middle class.  Source: \"INDA - Signs of Low Correlation?\" Such \"big picture\" investments generally have plenty of attention and India is no exception with numerous large offerings such as the iShares MSCI India (INDA), iShares India 50 (INDY) and Invesco India (PIN) ETFs.  As we saw however, over a longer period of time, actively managed funds have handily outperformed the passive ETFs. But what about \"Smart Beta\" offerings such as the WisdomTree India Earnings ETF (EPI)? We took an initial deep dive into the fund in the article \"WisdomTree India Earnings Fund - Better Than iShares But Still No Point.\" What we found is that while the fund\\'s focus on earnings did at times help it outperform its passive peers, there was no consistent alpha.\\n The question today then is does that \"smart beta\" strategy help lower the volatility? Let\\'s take a look. What\\'s New Fund Basics  Sponsor: WisdomTree. Index: WisdomTree India Earnings Index AUM: Approximately $1.427 billion (12/26/2018), down from $1.55 billion as of our previous article on 6/11/2018. Historical Style: Emerging Markets Large Caps - India. Investment Objectives: The fund seeks to track the investment results of profitable companies in the Indian equity market. . Number of Holdings: 344 securities. Current Yield: 1.42%. 30 Day SEC Yield Inception Date: 2/22/2008. Fees: .84%.  Source: YCharts & iShares The most meaningful difference since our initial article is that the fund, not unlike the iShares India ETF (INDA) has shrunk its assets under management to under $1.5 billion. \\n\\nEPI data by YCharts One point which we noted and discussed in the initial article is that EPI has not had a great time with capital raising in the previous few years and lost over $1.1 billion in assets in the three years ending 5/31/2018. Looking at YCharts data we can see that through the end of November the fund had seemingly put a plug into the outflows. This suggests that the overall drop in assets under management over the last 6 months was due to performance and not investors selling shares. \\n\\n Source: YCharts Looking at the top 10 holdings, we can see the largest positions remain the same with only small changes to the allocations.\\n \\n\\n Source: WisdomTree One of the competitive advantages for EPI is that it is far less concentrated than the largest India ETF, (INDA) and has the top 10 holdings represent 39.75% of the portfolio versus 50.67% for (INDA). The sectors also remain largely the same. One point of difference here versus (INDA) is that Energy makes up 18% of the portfolio vs 13% for the iShares. \\n\\n Source: WisdomTree The market capitalization also remains relatively unchanged. \\n\\n Source: YCharts One other difference between EPI and INDA is that mid and small cap companies actually exist in EPI and missing from INDA. This is due to the underlying methodology differences with INDA being a typical market capitalization weighted methodology. Performance So, how did the fund perform? EPI was launched during the 2008 Financial Crisis. As a result we have some longer term data encompassing a complete market cycle. Over the previous 5 years the fund has managed to achieve a .9811 beta. This suggests that the fund\\'s \"smart beta\" strategy essentially took on all of the market risk. This is not surprising considering the immense amount of holdings in the fund.\\n Since its launch the fund sustained a maximum drawdown of 66.21% once again reminding investors that no matter the strategy, you can still lose substantial capital. \\n\\n Source: YCharts Since our initial article on June 11th, the fund is down 5.36% on a price per share basis and 4.59% on a total return basis. The fund has recovered quite a bit from the November lows when it was down double digits. \\n\\nEPI data by YCharts Is the fund disconnected from domestic volatility? Generally throughout 2018, the fund seemed to be subject to the same ups and downs as our domestic markets. During the sell off in October the fund was hit bad, however in November it seemed to rebound while domestic markets continued to tumble. \\n\\nEPI Total Return Price data by YCharts The fund is down 10.9% for the year on a total return basis, nearly twice worse than the S&P 500 losing 5.26%. As we know, the fund has plenty of competitors including passive ETFs such as the iShares India (INDA), iShares India 50 (INDY) and PowerShares India Portfolio (PIN) ETFs along with open and closed end mutual funds such as the Matthews India (MINDX), Wasatch Emerging India (WAINX), Eaton Vance Greater India (ETGIX), India Investment (IIF) and Aberdeen India (IFN) funds.\\n Over the last 6 months or so, since our initial article on the fund, (EIP) has achieved a 4.59% total return loss. While this squarely places it in the middle the pack, the other passive ETFs have all lost less. As we discussed yesterday, this would be consistent with the flight to large and mega caps during times of uncertainty. \\n\\nEPI Total Return Price data by YCharts For the year, the relative performance gets worse as not only is EPI outperformed by passive ETFs, but also many actively managed products. \\n\\nEPI Total Return Price data by YCharts Is it possible that earnings are not the main driver of performance? I believe that is a resounding yes. Looking back over the previous 5 years shows us that while EPI\\'s methodology did outperform the more concentrated (INDA) and (PIN), the fund was outperformed by a few percentage points by the more concentrated iShares India 50 ETF (INDY). Furthermore, all of the passive products were far surpassed by the actively managed funds. \\n\\nEPI Total Return Price data by YCharts Bottom Line I believe the WisdomTree India Earnings ETF (EPI) is yet another example of what ETF investing is all about. It is about gaining exposure to a specific strategy which you can implement in one \"ticket.\" It is NOT however about a strategy designed to earn you returns or somehow \"beating the market\" as what every actively managed investment is about.\\n This ETF seeks to \"track the investment results of profitable companies in the Indian equity market.\" The reasons why WisdomTree believes you should invest in (EPI) are: \\n\\n Source: WisdomTree So far, we have seen that this ETF has indeed provided Indian exposure and at times has outperformed certain other Indian ETFs. Yet at the same time, the fund has underperformed others.  Most of all however is that the fund has shown that any semi-competent actively managed investment can return multiples over passive products, further solidifying the point... \"if you want to invest in inefficient emerging markets, you need to be actively involved in the investment process, you cannot expect to generate \"alpha\" by merely buying the largest companies or sorting them based on financial statement metrics from 8,000 miles away.\" For more information about the WisdomTree India Earnings Fund, please visit the fund\\'s website here.

Recently, the stock has come under pressure. Here's the chart (current at the time of writing):   \\n\\nHAS data by YCharts   That $78 price is closer to the 52-week low (again, time of writing) of $76.84 than the high of $109.60. No one likes that type of price action. Hasbro, however, should be investigated by potential shareholders at this point. There are three main reasons for this:  Dividend yield Brand equity and ability to not only generate compelling toys/collectibles but to also acquire valuable licenses that have the potential to generate good returns Eventual move into an aggressive filmed-entertainment strategy (largest risk)  I will use this article to present, in brief, an overall positive thesis on the stock. Dividend Yield The dividend yield is currently over 3%. If you look at current cash flow levels, admittedly, it doesn't look so solid. Operational cash flow was about $175 million over the last three quarters versus $202 million in the comparable period, according to the latest earnings release. Capital spending was flat at $104 million, but dividend payments increased from $206 million to $230 million (again, over the nine-month period). Adding the dividend payment and the capital investment, obviously, fully wipes out the operational cash flow and creates a deficit. Let's look at recent cash flow history from the annual report for 2017, page 54. Cash from operations for the years 2015, 2016, and 2017 was approximately $570 million, $817 million, and $724 million, respectively. Capital spending in those same respective years was basically relatively steady at $142 million, $155 million, and $135 million. Dividends paid: $226 million, $249 million, $277 million. The controlled capital investment, coupled with the increasing cash flow, helped to power the dividend.\\n Cash flow can vary from year to year, especially during different business cycles and disruptive events. I believe Hasbro will do fine with its dividend growth over time. This year it was hit with the Toys R Us disappearance. The company also arguably was affected by possible Star Wars fatigue. I would not consider the current cash flow indicative of a negative long-term trend, for reasons I will now discuss. Brand Equity/Toymaking Experience Hasbro is a valuable trademark. Consumers associate the name with quality toys and assign the brand a high level of equity. The company develops its own toy IP as well as engaging the licensing business. A cycle of consumption occurs as families hand down the tradition of buying toys and gadgets for subsequent generations. Management has a lot of data on the act of gift-giving, play habits, and collecting/display behavior. The company also has access to core brands (e.g., board games like Monopoly) that generate recurring revenue that allows for research and development that can not only lead to the realization of new IP but also to short-term fad-type products that can boost sales. Such volatility does run the risk of creating a not-so-smooth curve on the cash flow graph, but like other IP businesses, any given year will be different (just ask any Hollywood-studio head). As the company's corporate site makes clear right up front, brands power the business/stock. Whether it's a licensed brand or an in-house one, the company bets on trademarks and the public's familiarity/demand for them. The company goes after both genders with separate toy lines, such as Baby Alive dolls and Beyblade, and has ones that appeal to both, like Play-Doh. Furthermore, this is the company behind Transformers, which is a valuable multimedia property. The most exciting licensing partnership is with Disney (DIS) for the aforementioned Star Wars toys, but the company also distributes figures/dolls based on Marvel characters and the Frozen universe. This isn't to say there can't be volatility, as I've mentioned. From the Q3 earnings report, we see that Franchise Brand sales (this includes owned-IP items like Monopoly, Nerf, etc.) decreased 5%. Partner Brands went down 37%. Emerging Brands, a very interesting category, increased slightly by 2%. The Emerging Brands segment includes items that are newly developed or are previously known but in need of a reboot; management describes this as an entrepreneurial segment (page 4 of the 2017 10-K), where new ideas can be hatched and/or applied to existing IP. This mix of categories amply describes the brand model.\\n Filmed Entertainment Here is the biggest opportunity for the company, in my opinion, one that has not been amply exploited yet - filmed entertainment. Hasbro Studios is the television-content arm of the company (page 3 of the 2017 10-K). The company also owns a film label, Allspark Pictures, and a cartoon outfit called Allspark Animation. The company distributes content on several platforms and even has an interest in Discovery Family Channel. The annual report makes clear that the company values storytelling as a viable asset. I do, as well, and believe storytelling will be a big market in the future for many companies like Hasbro, given all the momentum in the streaming industry (i.e., I don't believe it is played out yet). The Allspark film unit helped to produce Ouija: Origin of Evil, based on the classic board game. Allspark was also involved with the latest Transformers spinoff, Bumblebee, playing in theaters now. Hasbro is benefitting from the Transformers franchise, in terms of both profit participation and marketing for the toy lines, but the big money will eventually come from increasing the number of projects the company self-produces with its own financing. This is how Marvel, when it was a private outfit, became so valuable. It is impossible for me to consider that Hasbro won't explore that option in a bigger way than it is now. When that happens, the stock should react positively. In fact, recall that Hasbro tried to buy DreamWorks Animation, now owned by Comcast (CMCSA), and it also attempted to merge with Lions Gate Entertainment (LGF.A) (LGF.B). This should signal to current/potential shareholders that the company will eventually participate in some transformative media deal in the future. The company could even try to do a deal with a private business. Perhaps some entity like Archie Comic Publications might be an interesting idea for a company like Hasbro, especially given that Netflix (NFLX) took over Millarworld. Valuation/Conclusion Let me bullet-point the Hasbro thesis:\\n  The company's stock currently has a dividend yield over 3%. The dividend has increased over the last five years at a growth rate of 5%. The P/E ratio is 18, on par with the S&P 500's P/E value. That may not signal super-cheap, so take that into account, but my preference, in this case, is to focus on the yield. Hasbro is a typical high-brand-equity concern that generates positive cash flow based on its portfolio and should be able to expand current cash flow levels in the years ahead once it adjusts to a post-Toys-R-Us world. It's not much different than buying a foodstuffs product at a decent yield. The only difference is we are talking toys/IP instead of snacks/beverages. Consumers will always buy toys as gifts and collectibles. In the near future, Hasbro will most likely further expose itself to storytelling. This will involve a higher degree of self-financed filmed entertainment. This will hedge against the retail toy business while simultaneously explore growth/merger opportunities. I would not be surprised to see Hasbro try again for Lions Gate, or pursue smaller, private acquisitions. This is the biggest risk of the thesis, as it may be something that might reach critical mass later than expected.  Please perform your own due diligence before buying any stock.\\nDisclosure: I am/we are long CMCSA, DIS, LGF.A. I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions.

Before the two countries entered a trade dispute, China was the world’s major importer of US shale oil, and commentators suggest that the Xi-Trump deal was, in part, an attempt by China to avoid tariffs being imposed on commodities including crude oil imports. Following the G20 summit, tensions were supposed to have eased between the world’s two largest economies, with a 90-day truce reportedly agreed by the two leaders. It was expected that, during that window, China would resume US oil imports, but the overall outlook for trade flow between the two in 2019 remains gloomy, and it is unclear what will happen when the truce ends. China has already moved to substitute its US imports with increased imports from Saudi Arabia and Russia. According to Chinese customs data, China’s crude oil imports hit a record 9.65 million barrels a day in October. Most of this high-demand growth was fulfilled by the crude-oil spot market, particularly Russia’s Siberia-Pacific Ocean (ESPO) pipeline.\\n In November, however, Saudi Arabia was China’s top crude oil supplier with 1.596 million barrels per day (bpd). Russia came in second with 1.593 million bpd. Saudi Arabia was the No. 1 supplier to China for a decade up to 2016. And even though the Kingdom has no crude-oil pipeline into Chinese territory, Saudi Aramco’s marketing strategy was able to return it to the top of the pile in November. Saudi Aramco’s existing long-term crude supply agreements with Chinese customers are expected to raise its exports to China in 2019 to nearly 1.7 million bpd. Russian oil exports to China, too, are expected to increase next year, with 600,000 bpd via the Skovorodino-Mohe-Daqing pipeline, a spur of the ESPO pipeline, and another 200,000 bpd via Kazakhstan. The rest is expected to come from the Pacific port of Kozmino, the ESPO endpoint. During its trade war with the US, China has cut its crude oil imports from the US to zero. It has also cut oil imports from Iran to an eight-year low, a move it began even before the trade war — cutting imports below the level prior to the sanctions on Iranian oil, a point to which it has not returned since, despite the drop in oil prices in the final quarter of 2018. Despite Chinese imports from Iran and the US dropping drastically, the shortfall has been made up by increased imports from Saudi Arabia and Russia. This suggests that the US sanction waivers only succeeded in affecting market sentiment, rather than market fundamentals. However, the trade dispute has certainly affected the US and Chinese equities markets. Both are under-performing, despite the US equity markets’ resilience earlier in 2018. The latest turmoil has proven too much. So far, the International Energy Agency \"IEA\" has exacerbated the situation involving the escalation in US-China trade tensions to adversely impact the global economy in order to lower the growing demand for oil — a move that is hard to explain or justify, as new refineries and increased utilization rates will stimulate additional demand.\\n Yet the economic impact of the US-China trade argument is not market-reflective. Surprisingly, some economists are suggesting that the trade dispute could spark a global recession, sending incremental oil demand lower. This has caused growing concern about supply and poor economic growth that has pushed oil prices lower, based purely on sentiment. The IEA should reconsider its earlier downward outlook for oil demand that has introduced a bearish sentiment over the past few months after Brent prices rose to $86 in early October.

The company has a history of growth with a slower but more sustainable growth expected for 2019. The stock is undervalued after the recent market decline, but there are some risks investors need to consider. Earnings growth has slowed and the company does operate with a fairly low operating margin (profit to sales ratio). Also Centene Corporation's earnings would be reduced if the currently suspended ObamaCare Affordable Care Act is reinstated. Financials Centene Corporation has reported financial results for the third quarter of 2018 (data from Seeking Alpha and Yahoo). The company's earnings were up 54 percent and its revenue up 36 percent from the third quarter of 2017. Historically, from 2013 to 2017 Centene Corporation's revenue has grown 41 percent per year and its earnings have increased by 47 percent per year. The return on equity is fair at 10 percent and the operating margin (profit to sales ratio) is quite low at 1.7 percent. The company's book value is currently around $52 and with a stock price of $112 Centene Corporation is trading at 2.2x book value. The analysts' consensus forecast for 2019 is $60.0 billion in revenue and earnings of $8.38 per share (up 17 percent and 19 percent respectively). The 2019 PE ratio is 13x. Centene Corporation does have a solid history of growth; however this growth is expected to slow through 2019. According to Bloomberg, Michael Frederic Neidorff, Chairman & Chief Executive Officer has stated that the company will continue to seek out and make acquisitions of any size. In my opinion this may well be an attempt by the company to bolster it's earnings as growth seems to be slowing. To see how effective this strategy is I will have to wait for the 2019 earnings results. Over the last year Centene Corporation has successfully integrated its last acquisition - Fidelis Care - as evident with a rise in third quarter earnings of 54 percent.\\n The Affordable Care Act The Trump administration has suspended the ObamaCare Affordable Care Act. This program plays a key role in the health insurance market, a move that will affect the earnings of insurers depending on the health of their clients. The Affordable Care Act's risk adjustment program tells insurers with relatively healthy clients to hand over some of their premiums to health plans with relatively unhealthy clients. The basic idea under the Affordable Care Act was that people with pre-existing conditions could obtain affordable health insurance. This in effect meant that insurers who offered health coverage to people with pre-existing conditions would receive a payment from the premiums of health coverage plans from healthy people. Now since most large insurers were more reluctant to insure pre-existing conditions, under the Affordable Care Act this enticed the smaller insurers to take on these pre-existing conditions as they would be effectively compensated. The suspension of the Affordable Care Act will tend to benefit the larger companies and put pressure on the smaller companies as they will no longer be effectively compensated for taking on the pre-existing conditions clients. Centene Corporation is a large-cap $23 billion dollar company that is on a mission to acquire any company it can find. In my opinion the suspension of the Affordable Care Act will benefit Centene Corporation. The smaller insurers will find it more difficult to operate profitably, which means that their valuation drops and thereby making a takeover bid from Centene Corporation more attractive. Earnings Risks Suspension of the Affordable Care Act does pose some risk to Centene Corporation. While the suspension is profitable to the company, the suspension is just that - a suspension. If the Trump administration lifts the suspension and resumes the Affordable Care Act then Centene Corporation will take an earnings hit (due to the additional costs of having to pay over a percentage of their health care premiums).\\n According to Investors Business Daily, the risk-adjustment for 2018 was $1.1 billion and considering its forecast profit is around $1.7 billion in 2019, the company's profit could take a decent hit. As earnings are already forecast for slower growth, any further decline in earnings is not something that I would want to see. Slower growth means that the stock's valuation would fall. Another risk is highlighted in the financials. Centene Corporation's operating margin (profit to sales ratio) is quite low at only 1.7 percent. This means that the company's operating costs are 98.3 percent of its revenue. There's not much room for operating costs to increase before the company becomes unprofitable. Given that revenue is forecast at a lower growth rate for 2019, if operating costs increase then earnings could become negative. Stock Valuation Having established that Centene Corporation is a growth stock I will now take a look at what those shares are worth. I will use the PEG (PE divided by the earnings growth rate) as this is an accepted method for valuing growth stocks. The historical earnings growth using reported data from 2013 to 2017 is 47 percent per year, and the forward annual earnings growth using forecast data is 19 percent for 2019. Given that earnings growth may be slowing, using the lower 2019 annual earnings growth of 19 percent will lead to a more conservative valuation and this lower growth rate is more likely to be sustained into the future. This gives a forward PEG of 0.7 with a 2019 PE of 13x. A forward PEG of 0.7 means that Centene Corporation is undervalued with a current stock price of $112. It is commonly accepted that a stock is fairly valued when its forward PEG is 1.0 which gives Centene Corporation a fair value stock price of around $160. Stock Price Target As an active investor I personally like to determine some likely price targets. As a growth company the stock price could increase at the rate of its earnings growth rate. Given that the 2019 earnings growth rate is 19 percent the stock price could increase by that amount over the next year. The current stock price is $112 and in 12 months the stock price could be around $130.\\n However, the stock has pulled back with the PEG valuation currently at 0.7 and with a fair value PEG of 1.0 the stock price could be 19 percent above the current fair value of $160. This gives a 12 month price target of $190. Stock Price Risks The stock price has pulled back 23 percent from its record high of $146 down to $112 over the last two months. This pullback coincides with the pullback in the broader market indices. While the stock is undervalued at present, this can change if future earnings growth slows or stops. The forecast earnings growth is less than its five year historical growth rate and if future earnings fall short of forecasts this will increase the PEG valuation. This can potentially make Centene Corporation expensive. The broader market also poses a risk. The market indices have been trending upwards with a bull market that began in 2009. These market indices have currently pulled back from their highs and it's always possible that this is the start a bear market. Also, the stock's pullback may not yet have bottomed and the stock price could fall some more. Investors would need to be prepared as the stock price could fall some more before bottoming out. Over the longer term I would expect the stock price to fully recover and continue higher in line with Centene Corporation's future growth potential. Conclusion Centene Corporation is a growth company that's undervalued based on its earnings potential. While the 2019 growth rate is less than its historical growth rate, this lower growth rate is more likely to be sustained into the future. Even with the lower growth rate Centene Corporation is still undervalued, but there are some risks to its earnings. The company does operate with a fairly low operating margin (profit to sales ratio). Also earnings would be reduced if the Affordable Care Act suspension is lifted. While Centene Corporation does pose a higher level of risk I still think the stock would make a sound long-term investment with potential for significant capital gains.\\n\\nDisclosure: I/we have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

Emerging markets have experienced pressure throughout the year on their currencies and equities with the MSCI Emerging Markets Index down 18% year-to-date. There is a sense in the market that the global reflation theme of 2016 and synchronized global growth of 2017 proved to be a false dawn. Remember, in late 2015 and January 2016 markets were in a state of turbulence.

Federal Reserve tightening concerns were also at the forefront of the market. These issues seem to be coming back and perhaps more strongly.  What happened that made these issues go away and then suddenly re-appear? The answer is the stance of U.S. monetary policy. The Federal Reserve under Yellen with a weaker U.S. economy than currently was decidedly more dovish. When Yellen paused throughout 2016 in response to financial conditions, global concerns and sub-par U.S. economic data, everything was alleviated. Powell is facing a different situation where U.S. unemployment is below both the natural and non-inflation-accelerating rate. The inflation goal is essentially met. Growth is above trend and government deficits have widened providing stimulus to the economy. Powell is likely inclined to continue tightening raising rates two or three times in 2019 while leaving the balance sheet unwind (quantitative tightening) on autopilot at $50 billion in securities per month.\\n I believe this is the right decision. If the Fed were to pause for a considerable time, the risk of falling behind the curve on inflation is too great. These are not normal times. The Federal Reserve in response to the global financial crisis in 08, embarked on several years of quantitative easing (QE) and has injected trillions in liquidity into the banking system providing massive potential for an excessive credit expansion leading to inflationary overshoot. The Federal Reserve is very cognizant of this risk and well aware of the 1970's inflationary episode, which is widely attributed to holding rates too low for too long in the 1960's. Many are claiming continuing to tighten risks a policy mistake through a premature recession. I take the opposite and somewhat unpopular opinion, that not tightening would be the real policy mistake. Moving rates to neutral or slightly above risks little harm to the real, core U.S. economy though financial markets will react negatively. Tightening now will prolong the expansion by avoiding a repeat of the Volcker recessions, where Fed Chair, Paul Volcker, had to respond to inflationary pressures by raising interest rates quickly and drastically above neutral, sending the economy into a recession. By continuing to tighten, global risk and growth assets, such as oil, copper, and equities may decline. This tightening and growth asset decline is not necessarily unhealthy as it keeps inflation and inflationary expectations contained and avoids an upside breakout that requires significantly higher rates or financial excesses that then burst.  I remain optimistic on the U.S. dollar and DXY index. The USD is one of the few assets with positive YTD returns in 2018. I think Europe is sitting in a situation similar to where the U.S. was a couple years ago in 2016. I believe an extended pause from the ECB on rates is likely as Eurozone data continues to underperform, the equity sell-off continues and global growth (specifically China) decelerates. This will weigh on the EUR/USD, the largest component of the DXY index. \\n\\nDisclosure: I am/we are short FCX. I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions.

The stock recovered after the initial dip, but shares are now trading back below the $13 level again. \\n\\nWNC data by YCharts There are definitely risks to the story, but, as I previously described, Wabash National is worthy of investment dollars if your time horizon is longer than 12-18 months and if you are willing (and able) to stomach the volatility. The New Normal - Volatility Wabash National\\'s stock has traded in a 52-week range of $12.25 to $26.54, which works out to a variance of $14.29 (yes, a number that is above the current stock price). The stock is trading at $12.86, so it is currently slightly above the 52-week low (5%), but significantly below the 52-week high (106%). Management has failed to sell the market on Wabash National\\'s near-term business prospects, but the broader market volatility is also coming into play. To this point, the stock fell by 20% in October when management lowered its full-year 2018 guidance (updated to an adjusted EPS range of $1.50-1.55 from a range of $1.94-2.00), but shares recovered in short order. However, the recent market turmoil has wrecked serious havoc and has pulled WNC shares back down by almost 20% over the last month alone. Investors that put money to work in Wabash National today should expect for a bumpy ride through at least 2019, but, in my opinion, the risk/reward scenario makes the stock a long-term buy at current levels.\\n A Shareholder-Friendly Company That Is Trading At An Attractive Valuation It would be an understatement to say that Wabash has been focused on returning capital to shareholders. To start, management has bought back almost 10% of the company\\'s total shares over the last five years. \\n\\nWNC Average Diluted Shares Outstanding (Annual) data by YCharts Additionally, the board recently authorized for $100M to be added to its repurchase program. This is a meaningful figure when you consider the fact that Wabash\\'s total market cap is currently only $720M. Plus, let\\'s not forget that management is paying investors to be patient. The quarterly dividend was increased in December 2017 by 25% (from $0.06 to $0.075), and management raised it again in November 2018 by 6.7% (from $0.075 to $0.08). Wabash\\'s dividend yield is slightly above 2.4% at today\\'s price and, more importantly, the yield is supported by the current payout ratio. \\n\\n Source: Fidelity Wabash National\\'s stock is what I consider dirt cheap below $13 per share. The stock is trading at levels not seen since late 2016. \\n\\nWNC PE Ratio (TTM) data by YCharts\\n Moreover, WNC\\'s shares are attractively valued when compared to the company\\'s peer group. \\n\\nWNC PE Ratio (TTM) data by YCharts WNC shares look more attractive the further that you are able to look out. Investors should not expect for smooth sailing in 2019, but, in my opinion, Wabash appears to be well-positioned for the years ahead. A Realistic View Wabash is a highly cyclical company, so the stock will likely go as the economy goes. As such, on one hand, the healthy 2019 and 2020 GDP predictions are encouraging news for the company\\'s future business prospects. \\n\\n Source: Thebalance.com But, on the other hand, the probability of a U.S. recession over the next 12 months is slowly ticking higher, as described by Jason Cawley here. However, it is important to note that most CFOs do not anticipate a U.S. recession until the end of 2020. Investors appear to be in \"risk-off\" mode in the current environment, so I fully expect for WNC shares to be under pressure for at least the next few quarters. Tariffs are having a material impact on Wabash\\'s earnings, and, in my opinion, investors should expect more of the same in early 2019. Therefore, at the end of the day, WNC shares will likely continue to trade in a wide range, so anyone trying to make a quick buck on an investment in Wabash may want to look elsewhere. Risks A U.S. recession would have a negative impact on Wabash\\'s business. More specifically, the company\\'s operations are heavily tied to economic activity, so its customers would likely purchase less of its products if business prospects appear to be declining. Therefore, a downturn would materially impact the company\\'s stock price. However, with this being said, I do not believe that the U.S. will be entering into a recession in the near future, so this is currently not a significant risk.\\n Bottom Line Wabash is not an early 2019 story, but, instead, I believe that WNC shares are attractive if you are willing (and able) to invest for the years ahead. The stock will likely remain range-bound in the months/quarters ahead, but I believe that this small-cap company has promising long-term business prospects. As such, investors with a time horizon longer than two to three years should treat any further pullbacks as long-term buying opportunities.

I have not chimed in yet on Tesla (TSLA) because it\\'s hardly news that the company is significantly overvalued. And the company\\'s stock price remains lofted from CEO Elon Musk\\'s legions of fans. But news articles of admissions by Musk about the company\\'s near-death experience, as well as some other articles on the company\\'s Chinese woes with significantly lower auto sales, had prompted me to reconsider analyzing the company. If you reverse engineer the company\\'s market capitalization it\\'s easy to see how the $57 billion company is significantly overvalued. This does not mean the stock will come down soon, however, as recent short sellers will confess. But, one day, there will be a day of reckoning for the company. Valuations will come more in line with the reality of the company\\'s potential. The stock will move significantly lower. Here\\'s a long-term look at Tesla\\'s stock price:  \\n\\nHow much value do you get for one share? The current price of Tesla is $325.00. What do you get in the way of value from owning one share of the company at that price? I\\'m a value investor. I want to know that if I pay that kind of price, I get a certain amount of value from it. The current PE ratio for the S&P 500 is about 20 times earnings.  I think it might be asking quite a bit of an auto manufacturer to be valued at 20 times earnings. I would think 10 is far more reasonable considering the costs involved in producing a car. To be fair, Tesla is more than a car company, they also are a solar company. Slightly. SolarCity, the energy division of Tesla purchased for $2.6 billion, is part of Tesla. This represents all of 5% of the value of Tesla\\'s stock. The other 95% of Tesla is auto manufacturer. \\n Working with that for reference, Ford (F) has a 6.49 P:E ratio and General Motors (GM) has a 6.27. But, for the sake of argument, let\\'s go with the stock market\\'s average of 20. That would mean that in a given year the company\\'s stock would have earnings of $17.25 per share.  The logical next question would be: Can the company earn $17.25 per share any time soon? At one point, the company churned out 5,000 Model 3 autos in one week. This was done at breakneck speed and at the expense of other lines\\' production: The company wanted to prove a point, and they did. At that rate, which nearly anyone would admit the company cannot maintain for any length of time outside of the one week, the company would produce 250,000 autos a year.  The Model 3 now has a top line profit margin of 24%. The sale price of the auto is $59,000. That is about $12,000 in gross profits. That puts gross profits for the Model 3 at $3 billion. Since we are living in the world of irrational exuberance, let\\'s say the net profit margin for Tesla also is 20% - yes, for an automaker, and yes, irrational. That would be $700 million in net profits. At 20 times earnings, this division of the automaker would be worth $14 billion.  There are three autos being sold by Tesla including the Model X and the Model S. Combined, they account for 27,000 in annual sales. Their prices are $95k and $80k, respectively. Assuming a similar 24% top line profit margin, using the same math as above, these two autos account for about $11 billion in valuation. That totals $24 billion for the automaker. That\\'s well below the current ~$57 billion for the company\\'s current valuation. Roughly speaking, in order to get to the current valuation, the company would need to increase production by an order of 2.5 times. Keep in mind, they simply can\\'t.  Keep this in perspective: The other two models, the Model X and the Model S, while they have larger top-line numbers, do not have as many overall sales. But recent moves higher in sales of all vehicles have kept the company on track for selling the projected 250k autos per year:\\n \\n\\nSource: Tesla via Stasta Keep in mind the valuations on this are generous by what\\'s likely to be an order of magnitude. I would call the best case scenario for Tesla\\'s valuation being 10 times earnings. I also would say that in Tesla\\'s very best days the company will not hit a 5% net profit margin, let alone 20%. To be sure, Ford has net profit margins of 4.59% and GM has 2.34%. Tesla\\'s gross profits are at 24% and it\\'s thought that the company will have a difficult time maintaining that. So, a 20% net profit margin may be a stretch considering the company has a smaller output with a smaller economy of scale associated with their production. For comparison, Ford\\'s top line profit margins are 21.3%, whereas GM is at 18.5%. Tesla will now be producing lower-level autos being sold for in the low $20s. The company will have more revenue to work with. So, it\\'s not an impossibility.  Still, given these metrics, I would value the company at only $4.5 billion. That is about 1/13th of the current value of the company -Tesla\\'s stock needs to drop 92.7%.  Also, keep something else in mind: Tesla is not expected to be profitable, let alone gain full profitability, for several years. I put together an absolute best-case scenario with numbers and ratios that I feel are wildly optimistic. This is another factor that needs to be considered. And even my wild valuations metrics would not justify the current stock price.  Don\\'t go short Tesla stock just yet Short sellers be warned, however. When short sellers step in, they can push the stock around for a moment. However, inevitably, the stock just heads right back upwards. Notice this chart and look at the middle of the chart where there was some significant selling:\\n \\n\\nThe stock peaked at $360 in late February and then went down some $100. Here\\'s another chart that I put together via Nasdaq\\'s short seller information: \\n\\n Chart: Author\\'s chart via NASDAQ data There was a spike higher in short selling activity right in March. And every period since then, the short seller activity has been coming down lower and lower. If short sellers do not get rewarded quickly, they get out - or the costs will make it prohibitive. When the stock moved back upwards after its move lower, short sellers moved out of their positions. Tesla\\'s stock is resilient despite the reality of the company\\'s financial situation.  Musk is infallible Recently, Elon Musk admitted Tesla was close to folding. As CNBC states: Tesla CEO Elon Musk said in an Axios interview that aired on HBO, that Tesla had been \"near death\" and \"bleeding cash\" in 2018, contradicting prior investor communications and interviews. Investors, creditors and suppliers all made deals of some kind with Tesla given a different knowledge of what the company\\'s outlook was. This could backfire on Tesla and Musk in the future if they are ever short on cash again and need to raise capital. This also could be a souring event for the company with financial regulators and open up a whole host of other issues such as further scrutiny with their financial paperwork.  Yet, the stock remains lofted. An event like this could be the beginning of the end for a company that burns as much cash as Tesla does - the company burns through some $7,000 per minute. Musk stated that the company would not need additional capital in 2018, it also stated the company would have positive cash flow by the end of this calendar year. As of the company\\'s Sept. 30 financial documents, Tesla has some $3.12 billion in cash. Given the burn rate that Bloomberg is quoting, that amounts to 445,715 minutes of cash. Starting with Sept. 30, that gives Tesla until July 6, 2019. So, yes, Musk is correct. Tesla will not need cash in 2018. However, they will need it in 2019.\\n Here\\'s what the \"free cash flow\" picture looks like for Tesla: \\n\\nSource: Bloomberg There does appear to be \"free cash\"... and it\\'s flowing. If the company does not turn around its cash burn and free cash flow situation, then, the company could actually go bankrupt. And, yet, investors still bid up the stock. I\\'m not buying it... nor am I selling it I do not believe that Tesla will hit its ultimate goal of being profitable. I do believe the valuation is well beyond irrational exuberance. I also believe the stock will come down. But I do not believe the stock will see a long slow slide downward but, instead, I think there will be a single event that occurs that topples the company\\'s stock price. Given that, going short Tesla is difficult, but not impossible. The most likely thing to do is to take a long-term approach and use a delta-neutral options strategy. And I\\'m targeting the 6th of July as the day of reckoning.  Disclosure: I/we have no positions in any stocks mentioned, but may initiate a short position in TSLA over the next 72 hours.

I still have a land line phone. I never use it, no one I know calls me on it, but every month I pay the bill, almost without thinking about it. Staying tethered to the service is simply a habit (one I\\'m determined to break as part of my year-end checklist). A similar thing has been happening in the bond market. In the decade since the financial crisis, \"lower for longer\" has been the mantra for interest rates. Ten years is a long time, and in the interim, many bond investors have acquired the \"muscle memory\" of stretching for yield to meet their income goals. Now that the Fed is gradually raising its policy rate, however, it may be time for investors to break the habit of outsized credit and liquidity risks, and learn a new routine. The low rate environment had a big impact on how portfolios were constructed over the last decade. Not only have intermediate bond managers tilted into high-yield, emerging markets and loans, but many investors also have strayed out of bonds altogether into dividend-paying stocks. As we can see in the chart, since 2008, the median intermediate-term bond fund (green line) has become increasingly correlated to the stock market. Correlations dropped sharply in 2014, but have been inching up again. \\n\\n Why is this a problem? The reach for yield reduces the potential diversification benefits of owning bonds by increasing correlations to stocks. In other words, many of us likely have strayed from a primary purpose of owning bonds: offsetting the risk of stock volatility, something we\\'ve had no shortage of lately.\\n The good news is that we now have an opportunity to course-correct. And now, as you do a bit of year-end financial housekeeping, is a good time to revisit how you are sourcing yield and at what price. Here are three simple things to consider: (1) Consider short maturity bonds. With a flat yield curve and relatively tight credit spreads today, you don\\'t need to take on much interest rate risk or rely on higher-risk assets like stocks to generate income potential. High-quality ultrashort- and short-duration bonds are sitting in a sweet spot right now: they offer potentially attractive yields, and their short duration means they\\'re less exposed to interest rate risk (duration). (2) Rotate up in credit quality. We haven\\'t yet seen a material uptick in bond market volatility. As and when that may happen, though, we tend to see credit risk increase with it. Consider that the two-year Treasury currently yields nearly 3%, according to Bloomberg. Rotating into an ETF like the iShares 1-3 Year Treasury Bond ETF (NYSEARCA:SHY) can be a low-cost way to up the overall credit profile of your portfolio. You might even be able to capture a tax loss, as market prices for investment-grade corporate bonds have declined somewhat. Another option to consider is the iShares Short Maturity Bond ETF (BATS:NEAR), with a mix of floating and fixed rate bonds and more than 65% in issuers rated at least single A.[1] (3) Keep more of what you earn. Could you be paying over 20% of your yield in fees? Shocking, right? I had the unpleasant experience of seeing that the seven-day cash yield in my brokerage account was in a government fund charging 42 basis points in annual fees, or nearly 20% of its gross yield. In a similar vein, I recently heard a pitch for a four-star short duration fund charging nearly 70 basis points. It may have sounded like a compelling story, but not at 25% of my yield. This should go without saying, but over time price can materially impact performance. It\\'s a new era for interest rates and time for a rethink on building a portfolio for the outcomes you want. As \"lower for longer\" becomes yesterday\\'s truth, it\\'s time to cut the cord on old habits and develop new ones for your bonds.\\n [1] Credit quality ratings on underlying securities of the fund are received from S&P, Moody’s and Fitch and converted to the equivalent S&P major rating category.

For fiscal year 2018, Coca-Cola (KO) non-GAAP EPS is estimated at $2.02, virtually unchanged from $2.01 for FY 2012. KO share price at close on Wednesday Dec. 26 was $46.94, up ~30% from the share price of $36.25 at the end of December 2012. Over the same period the S&P 500 has grown by ~80%. The outcome of an investment in KO at the current share price will be determined by future dividend receipts and the share price at which we might be able to exit the investment in the future. The current share price is a known. With a long history of dividend payments and dividend growth (dividend increases for last 56 years), we should be able to fairly reliably project estimated dividend payments per share for KO. That leaves one unknown, the share price of KO in the future. Let’s take a more in-depth look at KO’s future prospects and potential impact on future share price and investor total returns. About Coca-Cola Limited Excerpted from Coca-Cola 2017 10-K Business Overview The Coca-Cola Company is the world's largest beverage company. We own or license and market more than 500 nonalcoholic beverage brands, which we group into the following category clusters:\\n  sparkling soft drinks; water, enhanced water and sports drinks; juice, dairy and plant-based beverages; tea and coffee; and energy drinks.  We own and market four of the world's top five nonalcoholic sparkling soft drink brands:  Coca-Cola, Diet Coke, Fanta and Sprite.  Finished beverage products bearing our trademarks, sold in the United States since 1886, are now sold in more than 200 countries. We make our branded beverage products available to consumers throughout the world through our network of Company-owned or -controlled bottling and distribution operations as well as independent bottling partners, distributors, wholesalers and retailers — the world's largest beverage distribution system. Beverages bearing trademarks owned by or licensed to us account for more than 1.9 billion of the approximately 60 billion servings of all beverages consumed worldwide every day. We believe our success depends on our ability to connect with consumers by providing them with a wide variety of beverage options to meet their desires, needs and lifestyles. Our success further depends on the ability of our people to execute effectively, every day. Our objective is to use our Company's assets — our brands, financial strength, unrivaled distribution system, global reach, and the talent and strong commitment of our management and associates — to become more competitive and to accelerate growth in a manner that creates value for our shareowners. We were incorporated in September 1919 under the laws of the State of Delaware and succeeded to the business of a Georgia corporation with the same name that had been organized in 1892. Figure 1 \\n\\n Source: KO website The Coca-Cola Company 2017 Annual Review A Systematic Approach To Reviewing KO's Past And Projected Future Performance\\n Here at Analysts' Corner we have a systematized process for determining whether a purchase of KO shares at current prevailing prices is likely to provide an acceptable rate of return going forward. Part of this process requires collection of historic data and quantification of a range of future expectations for KO, in a format suitable for direct comparison to past results. We have found it convenient to undertake a review process in the course of collection of data. KO Share Price History Figure 2- KO Share Price History End Of 2012 to present \\n\\n Source: Seeking Alpha Essential here. Figure 2 reflects KO share price increasing from $36.25 at end of 2012 to $46.94 at Dec. 26, 2018. The share price jumped to $44.83 toward s the end of November 2014. It then drifted aimlessly until it shot up to $46.87 in April 2016. The share price has been mostly lower since then, until recently it spiked above $50. It has now settled back to the current price of $46.94 at Dec. 26, 2018, just a tad higher than the price back in April 2016. Despite some volatility in the share price, there has been no sustained growth in share price over the last several years. KO Dividends history and projections With dividends, shareholders receive a direct and tangible benefit, compared to the indirect and less tangible benefit provided by share repurchases. From Seeking Alpha, a long-term view of KO Dividend growth per Figure 3 below. Figure 3 – KO Dividend History 1990 to present \\n\\n\\n Source: Seeking Alpha Essential (note - apparent decreases are result of share splits) Unlike its share price, KO's dividend per share has seen steady growth over the last four years, with annualized DPS increasing from $1.22 in 2014 to $1.56, for 2018. In fact, KO has achieved 56 years of unbroken dividend growth (see here). Over the past four years, the annualized dividend increase has decreased from 10 cents per year to 8 cents per year. The dividend is certainly under pressure, with payout ratio currently just under 75%. For my base projections I have included dividends for KO through end of FY 2022, based on a continuation of the 2 cents quarterly increase each year (8 cents annualized). Projections Earnings and EPS - non-GAAP For fourth quarter 2018 to end of FY 2020 I have used consensus estimates from Seeking Alpha Essential (see here). Share Repurchases Since beginning of 2017, through the end of third quarter 2018, KO has repurchased ~115MM shares for ~$5.1 billion at an average of a little over $44 per share. Outstanding shares over the same period have reduced by only 30MM shares due to issues of shares by way of stock compensation. Outstanding debt and interest expense Loan balances decreased by $2.848 billion between the end of 2017 and end of third quarter 2018. If I were to distill the source of that decrease down to a couple of items, it would be from a reduction in cash and investments and disposal of assets held for sale. Cash and investments decreased by $1.566 billion in the nine months to the end of September 2018. Assets held for sale decreased by $1.158 billion from $7.329 billion to $6.171 billion. If KO can achieve book value for remaining assets held for sale, we could see further reductions in debt levels. At the same time, the recently announced Costa purchase for $5.1 billion (see here) could reduce cash balances or absorb any funds from asset sales. Harvesting The Output Of Our KO Data Gathering Exercise The following tables are auto generated from the input we gather:\\n BG Historical Shareholder Returns TABLE 1 \\n\\n Variability in returns presents risk and opportunity I find the auto-generated TABLE 1 provides an interesting, useful, and perhaps surprising picture of the degree of variability of historical returns for investments in shares of a company. We generally find there's a significant and surprising variability in returns for almost any company under review. In the case of KO the results are a surprise in that they are all positive and cover a relatively narrow range. If we ignore the outliers, the low return of 5.77% for Investor A is not too far away from the high return of 8.75% for Investor B. This low variability in returns is due to a share price exhibiting low volatility, with returns mainly derived from the dividend. By way of comparison, our recent reviews of Bunge Limited (BG) revealed returns ranging from around negative 5% to 10% positive, and for Archer Daniels Midland (ADM) from 1.5% to 21.6% positive (see here and here). These different outcomes, resulting purely from share price at buy date, illustrate the importance of forward-looking assessments of the potential for satisfactory returns at the point of purchase of shares. Analysts' Corner's 1View∞Scenarios dashboards (see tables 4 and 5 further below) allow an investor to project similar data to that contained in table 1 and conduct an infinite amount of scenario testing to see what returns might be available from an investment in KO shares at current or targeted share price. I believe this quantitative approach is far superior to using betas, forward P/E ratios, PEG ratios, forward EPS estimates, and other indicators, to qualitatively review the prospects for an investment in shares.\\n KO Historical Earnings, EPS, P/E Ratio, And Share Price Growth TABLE 2 \\n\\nAs for table 1 above, table 2 is auto-generated from standardized data input – no human intervention required. Over the period 2012 to 2018 the items KO have adjusted out of GAAP results have resulted in a total increase of $14.6 billion in the headline non-GAAP results. Of this, $7.1 billion occurred in 2017 fiscal year, mainly due to tax reforms. Even without the tax reform adjustments, adjustments averaging more than $1 billion per year have been added back to increase non-GAAP profits over the last six years. This causes concern in case management is achieving non-GAAP profits by adjusting out recurring costs. The current (Dec. 26) non-GAAP P/E ratio of 23.26 is not far below long-term highs. The Analysts' Corner proprietary dashboards (tables 4 and 5 below) will allow us to quantify what's needed to justify an investment in KO at current share price of $46.94. It also will allow to determine at what share price KO might represent a suitable investment choice. This will vary for different investors, depending on their return expectations. KO Historical Financial Data Summary FY 2012 to FY 2018 From the input the historical financial data summary per table 3 below is auto generated. TABLE 3 \\n\\n The market looks at forward P/E ratios based on estimated EPS, which in turn are based on non-GAAP earnings estimates. It makes sense to have historical non-GAAP P/E ratio statistics against which to compare forward P/E ratios. Accordingly, Analysts' Corner includes non-GAAP as well as GAAP P/E ratios, in historical data, and in forward estimates. The historical summary for KO reveals a low level of long-term growth in EPS and a share price near historical highs. But on average, KO is a steady earner which has shown an ability to grow and pay dividends over the past 56 years. That completes the auto-generated historical financial summaries. We now are able to review the auto-generated projected financial summaries. The first of these is our table 4 Base projection dashboard which incorporates the projected data included in our input.\\n KO Interactive Dashboard - Rate Of Return Projections  (similar in form and content to TABLE 3 and including rate of return projections) This table 4 dashboard is designed to allow us to create and modify a Base forecast by manipulating inputs and seeing the resulting effect on rate of return, share price, P/E ratio and other meaningful statistics. When we believe we have created a suitable Base scenario we can then move to Table 5 dashboard which allows us to interactively vary input and simultaneously see the effect on rate of return and other KPIs compared to the Base forecast. TABLE 4 – Image 1 - Base projection after fine tuning \\n\\n Table 4 dashboard above is auto generated from the various standardized inputs. I have included only two adjustments before adopting as my Base projection. These adjustments are made through the input section in the center of the dashboard. I input the latest available share price of $47.53 at Dec. 27, 2018. I then input an expected 1% increase in share price on Dec. 28, 2018, to arrive at a targeted buy price of $48.01 on that day. From table 3, I can see historically the non-GAAP P/E ratio for KO has increased from 18.03 at end of 2012 to 23.35 at end of Q3-2018. At Dec. 27 price of $47.53, the non-GAAP P/E ratio is 23.65. For my Base forecast I assume the P/E ratio will decrease to ~23.0 in 2019 and hold at that level for the balance of the projections. Having incorporated these assumptions, the projected rate of return from buying KO shares at a price of $48.01 on Dec. 28, 2018, and exiting at end of 2019, is 6.66% per year. For an exit at the end of 2020 the projected rate of return is 7.67% per year. We can now move on to table 5 where we develop any number of different scenarios which we can compare to our Base scenario.\\n TABLE 5 – Image 1 - Base/Alternative Scenarios\\n\\n In Analysts' Corner we are able to work with live excel models to make assumption changes one by one to see the impact of each assumption change. In Table 5 above we input, in the center section in each of Q1 and Q3 2019, a 25 basis points increase in effective interest rates. We then assumed an interest rate increase would affect P/E multiples generally, and more so for companies like KO with high debt levels. We input the assumptions for interest rate increases and a reduction in P/E ratios from 23 to ~21. The projected rate of return for exit end of FY 2019 decreased from 6.66% per year to negative 1.46% per year. With assumed continued earnings growth in 2020, the rate of return for an exit at the end of 2020 remained positive at 3.11% per year, but still well below the 7.67% for the Base scenario Rating Sentiment Towards KO There exists a day-to-day dichotomy between a company's fundamentals and its share price. This is perhaps best evidenced by Amazon (AMZN), where frequent large swings occur in the share price, despite no apparent change in the fundamentals. So, I could be positive on a company's fundamentals, but find the current share price unattractive, or vice versa. To overcome this, Analysts' Corner has introduced a 2-tier rating system, where the attractiveness of the company and its current share price are separately evaluated. For both tiers, positive = P, neutral = N, and negative = X. For strongly or weakly positive, add a plus or a minus to get P+ or P-. For a stock which currently has a neutral outlook but with potential upside depending on a future event, we signify this with an N+. Conversely, if there is a potential future adverse event, this would be signified with an N-. For very negative sentiment, we add another X to make it XX.\\n Here are my ratings for KO. Fundamentals N. Share price N-. There will always be a need, or more correctly, a “want,” for the company's products. While KO does face competition, it has shown itself to be a superb competitor. It has shown itself to be adaptable, but constant adaptation has been costly. Over the years, those costs have been treated as non-recurring and adjusted out by adding back to arrive at non-GAAP profits substantially above GAAP results. There has to be a question whether this need for constant adaptation does not make the related costs recurring in nature and inappropriate for adding back to reflect underlying profits. These considerations lead us to be neutral on Coca Cola’s fundamentals and an N rating is assigned. In relation to the share price the P/E multiples appear stretched. With the Fed proposing two further interest rate hikes in 2019, KO is vulnerable to higher interest rates on its debt. Higher interest rates may cause a shrinking of P/E multiples across the board, but more particularly so for companies like KO with high debt levels. Based on 1View∞Scenarios dashboard modeling, per table 5 above, KO returns are highly sensitive to interest rate changes and a shrinking of multiples. On that basis we assign an N- to current KO share price. If we see evidence of a general shrinking of multiples emerging, after the expansion over the last five years, KO share price could be further down graded to an X.\\n\\nFor my Analysts' Corner members, a link is provided to allow download of the 1View∞Scenarios™ dashboards to allow them to do their own scenario testing.

Figure 3 – KO Dividend History 1990 to present \\n\\n\\n Source: Seeking Alpha Essential (note - apparent decreases are result of share splits) Unlike its share price, KO's dividend per share has seen steady growth over the last four years, with annualized DPS increasing from $1.22 in 2014 to $1.56, for 2018. In fact, KO has achieved 56 years of unbroken dividend growth (see here). Over the past four years, the annualized dividend increase has decreased from 10 cents per year to 8 cents per year. The dividend is certainly under pressure, with payout ratio currently just under 75%. For my base projections I have included dividends for KO through end of FY 2022, based on a continuation of the 2 cents quarterly increase each year (8 cents annualized). Projections Earnings and EPS - non-GAAP For fourth quarter 2018 to end of FY 2020 I have used consensus estimates from Seeking Alpha Essential (see here). Share Repurchases Since beginning of 2017, through the end of third quarter 2018, KO has repurchased ~115MM shares for ~$5.1 billion at an average of a little over $44 per share. Outstanding shares over the same period have reduced by only 30MM shares due to issues of shares by way of stock compensation. Outstanding debt and interest expense Loan balances decreased by $2.848 billion between the end of 2017 and end of third quarter 2018. If I were to distill the source of that decrease down to a couple of items, it would be from a reduction in cash and investments and disposal of assets held for sale. Cash and investments decreased by $1.566 billion in the nine months to the end of September 2018. Assets held for sale decreased by $1.158 billion from $7.329 billion to $6.171 billion. If KO can achieve book value for remaining assets held for sale, we could see further reductions in debt levels. At the same time, the recently announced Costa purchase for $5.1 billion (see here) could reduce cash balances or absorb any funds from asset sales. Harvesting The Output Of Our KO Data Gathering Exercise The following tables are auto generated from the input we gather:\\n BG Historical Shareholder Returns TABLE 1 \\n\\n Variability in returns presents risk and opportunity I find the auto-generated TABLE 1 provides an interesting, useful, and perhaps surprising picture of the degree of variability of historical returns for investments in shares of a company. We generally find there's a significant and surprising variability in returns for almost any company under review. In the case of KO the results are a surprise in that they are all positive and cover a relatively narrow range. If we ignore the outliers, the low return of 5.77% for Investor A is not too far away from the high return of 8.75% for Investor B. This low variability in returns is due to a share price exhibiting low volatility, with returns mainly derived from the dividend. By way of comparison, our recent reviews of Bunge Limited (BG) revealed returns ranging from around negative 5% to 10% positive, and for Archer Daniels Midland (ADM) from 1.5% to 21.6% positive (see here and here). These different outcomes, resulting purely from share price at buy date, illustrate the importance of forward-looking assessments of the potential for satisfactory returns at the point of purchase of shares. Analysts' Corner's 1View∞Scenarios dashboards (see tables 4 and 5 further below) allow an investor to project similar data to that contained in table 1 and conduct an infinite amount of scenario testing to see what returns might be available from an investment in KO shares at current or targeted share price. I believe this quantitative approach is far superior to using betas, forward P/E ratios, PEG ratios, forward EPS estimates, and other indicators, to qualitatively review the prospects for an investment in shares.\\n KO Historical Earnings, EPS, P/E Ratio, And Share Price Growth TABLE 2 \\n\\nAs for table 1 above, table 2 is auto-generated from standardized data input – no human intervention required. Over the period 2012 to 2018 the items KO have adjusted out of GAAP results have resulted in a total increase of $14.6 billion in the headline non-GAAP results. Of this, $7.1 billion occurred in 2017 fiscal year, mainly due to tax reforms. Even without the tax reform adjustments, adjustments averaging more than $1 billion per year have been added back to increase non-GAAP profits over the last six years. This causes concern in case management is achieving non-GAAP profits by adjusting out recurring costs. The current (Dec. 26) non-GAAP P/E ratio of 23.26 is not far below long-term highs. The Analysts' Corner proprietary dashboards (tables 4 and 5 below) will allow us to quantify what's needed to justify an investment in KO at current share price of $46.94. It also will allow to determine at what share price KO might represent a suitable investment choice. This will vary for different investors, depending on their return expectations. KO Historical Financial Data Summary FY 2012 to FY 2018 From the input the historical financial data summary per table 3 below is auto generated. TABLE 3 \\n\\n The market looks at forward P/E ratios based on estimated EPS, which in turn are based on non-GAAP earnings estimates. It makes sense to have historical non-GAAP P/E ratio statistics against which to compare forward P/E ratios. Accordingly, Analysts' Corner includes non-GAAP as well as GAAP P/E ratios, in historical data, and in forward estimates. The historical summary for KO reveals a low level of long-term growth in EPS and a share price near historical highs. But on average, KO is a steady earner which has shown an ability to grow and pay dividends over the past 56 years. That completes the auto-generated historical financial summaries. We now are able to review the auto-generated projected financial summaries. The first of these is our table 4 Base projection dashboard which incorporates the projected data included in our input.\\n KO Interactive Dashboard - Rate Of Return Projections  (similar in form and content to TABLE 3 and including rate of return projections) This table 4 dashboard is designed to allow us to create and modify a Base forecast by manipulating inputs and seeing the resulting effect on rate of return, share price, P/E ratio and other meaningful statistics. When we believe we have created a suitable Base scenario we can then move to Table 5 dashboard which allows us to interactively vary input and simultaneously see the effect on rate of return and other KPIs compared to the Base forecast. TABLE 4 – Image 1 - Base projection after fine tuning \\n\\n Table 4 dashboard above is auto generated from the various standardized inputs. I have included only two adjustments before adopting as my Base projection. These adjustments are made through the input section in the center of the dashboard. I input the latest available share price of $47.53 at Dec. 27, 2018. I then input an expected 1% increase in share price on Dec. 28, 2018, to arrive at a targeted buy price of $48.01 on that day. From table 3, I can see historically the non-GAAP P/E ratio for KO has increased from 18.03 at end of 2012 to 23.35 at end of Q3-2018. At Dec. 27 price of $47.53, the non-GAAP P/E ratio is 23.65. For my Base forecast I assume the P/E ratio will decrease to ~23.0 in 2019 and hold at that level for the balance of the projections. Having incorporated these assumptions, the projected rate of return from buying KO shares at a price of $48.01 on Dec. 28, 2018, and exiting at end of 2019, is 6.66% per year. For an exit at the end of 2020 the projected rate of return is 7.67% per year. We can now move on to table 5 where we develop any number of different scenarios which we can compare to our Base scenario.\\n TABLE 5 – Image 1 - Base/Alternative Scenarios\\n\\n In Analysts' Corner we are able to work with live excel models to make assumption changes one by one to see the impact of each assumption change. In Table 5 above we input, in the center section in each of Q1 and Q3 2019, a 25 basis points increase in effective interest rates. We then assumed an interest rate increase would affect P/E multiples generally, and more so for companies like KO with high debt levels. We input the assumptions for interest rate increases and a reduction in P/E ratios from 23 to ~21. The projected rate of return for exit end of FY 2019 decreased from 6.66% per year to negative 1.46% per year. With assumed continued earnings growth in 2020, the rate of return for an exit at the end of 2020 remained positive at 3.11% per year, but still well below the 7.67% for the Base scenario Rating Sentiment Towards KO There exists a day-to-day dichotomy between a company's fundamentals and its share price. This is perhaps best evidenced by Amazon (AMZN), where frequent large swings occur in the share price, despite no apparent change in the fundamentals. So, I could be positive on a company's fundamentals, but find the current share price unattractive, or vice versa. To overcome this, Analysts' Corner has introduced a 2-tier rating system, where the attractiveness of the company and its current share price are separately evaluated. For both tiers, positive = P, neutral = N, and negative = X. For strongly or weakly positive, add a plus or a minus to get P+ or P-. For a stock which currently has a neutral outlook but with potential upside depending on a future event, we signify this with an N+. Conversely, if there is a potential future adverse event, this would be signified with an N-. For very negative sentiment, we add another X to make it XX.\\n Here are my ratings for KO. Fundamentals N. Share price N-. There will always be a need, or more correctly, a “want,” for the company's products. While KO does face competition, it has shown itself to be a superb competitor. It has shown itself to be adaptable, but constant adaptation has been costly. Over the years, those costs have been treated as non-recurring and adjusted out by adding back to arrive at non-GAAP profits substantially above GAAP results. There has to be a question whether this need for constant adaptation does not make the related costs recurring in nature and inappropriate for adding back to reflect underlying profits. These considerations lead us to be neutral on Coca Cola’s fundamentals and an N rating is assigned. In relation to the share price the P/E multiples appear stretched. With the Fed proposing two further interest rate hikes in 2019, KO is vulnerable to higher interest rates on its debt. Higher interest rates may cause a shrinking of P/E multiples across the board, but more particularly so for companies like KO with high debt levels. Based on 1View∞Scenarios dashboard modeling, per table 5 above, KO returns are highly sensitive to interest rate changes and a shrinking of multiples. On that basis we assign an N- to current KO share price. If we see evidence of a general shrinking of multiples emerging, after the expansion over the last five years, KO share price could be further down graded to an X.\\n\\nFor my Analysts' Corner members, a link is provided to allow download of the 1View∞Scenarios™ dashboards to allow them to do their own scenario testing.

It has noted negative returns since 2016 leading to a lower market cap. The stock prices remained below the 200-day moving average year-to-date. The stock price has fallen below the 50-day average in December, marking a bearish trend for the stock. \\n\\n Source: Yahoo Finance Nielsen is an information and measurement company. It provides ”media and marketing information, analytics, and manufacturer and retailer expertise about what and where consumers buy, read, watch, and listen.\" Now we will study the factors contributing to the loss in stock value and market cap. Nielsen’s lowered revenue guidance Nielsen’s two reporting segments include:  Buy, which involves consumer purchase measurement and analytics. Watch, which involves media audience measurement and analytics.  Revenue grew by one percent in the nine months of fiscal 2018, a fall attributed to weaker revenue from the Buy segment partially offset by the Watch segment. Developed market drove the decline. Developed and emerging markets generated 62% and 37% of the revenue in the Buy segment in the nine months of fiscal 2018. Nielsen is expecting a revenue decline of 1% on a constant currency basis. The decrease was opposed to a 3% growth previously forecasted by the company in fiscal 2017. Historically revenue grew by 2.2% and 4.2% in fiscal 2016 and 2017 respectively. Continued weakness in Developed Buy and expected weakness in Emerging Buy due to China drove the expectations in the first half of fiscal 2018. The lower expectations also were reflected in the EBITDA margin, net income per share and free cash flow. The CEO also announced his departure at year end.\\n Therefore, I\\'m projecting a one percent decline in revenue for fiscal 2018 as expected by the company. After that, I have planned a revenue growth of one percent in the subsequent years. \\n\\n Sources: Nielsen and author estimates Rising costs and expenses consuming the profit margins Nielsen has maintained an impressive gross margin between 58%-59% between fiscal 2015 and 2017. The gross margin has been affected by the increase in the cost of revenue. A one percent increase in cost margin for the nine months of fiscal 2018 has reduced the gross margin by 1%. Global investments including retailer investments drove the costs of the Buy segment. The Gracenote acquisition in 2017 and product portfolio management initiatives drove the costs of the Watch segment. Therefore, the expected gross margin for fiscal 2018 is 57% against a cost margin of 43%. The investments, acquisitions and product portfolio management initiatives drove the operating costs as well in fiscal 2018. The company had maintained an EBITDA margin between 27%-28.4% between fiscal 2015 and 2017. The EBIT (operating) margin remained between 17.7-18.6%. A 2.1% increase in operating expense margin has reduced the EBITDA and EBIT margins by 3.1% and 3.6%, respectively, in the nine months of fiscal 2018. Therefore, the projected EBITDA and EBIT margins for fiscal 2018 are 25% and 14.6%, respectively. \\n\\n Sources: Nielsen and author estimates\\n Net interest expense has been calculated at six percent of revenue keeping in mind the historical trend, all of which has translated into a net margin of 5.5% for the expected years. Higher interest expense partially offset by slightly lower income tax provision (as assumed by the company) have reduced the net margin by 2.3% for the nine months of fiscal 2018. The slower revenue growth and higher costs and expenses have translated into a projected net margin of 5.5% for fiscal 2018. The net margin has reduced from 9.2% in fiscal 2015 to 6.5% in fiscal 2017. \\n\\n Source: Nielsen press release As of October 25, the company’s net income guidance declined from between $500-525 million to $340-360 million. The EPS (earnings per share) dropped by 30.7% in the nine months of fiscal 2018. It had declined by 9.8% and 13.6% in fiscal 2016 and 2017, respectively. According to the estimates, the EPS will shed 16.1% in fiscal 2018. \\n\\n Sources: Nielsen and author estimates What has Nielsen to offer to its buyers if it opts for a private equity placement? Rumors about a private equity placement are doing the rounds. Therefore, let us analyze the valuation of the company by its enterprise value to EBITDA multiple. Enterprise value is obtained by adding the market capitalization, debt, minority interest, and preferred shares, and deducting the cash and cash equivalents. \\n\\n\\n Sources: Nielsen and author estimates The present value of discounted cash flows is $3.8 billion. The exit year EBITDA corresponding to 2022 is $1.7 billion. The terminal value which is the product of the EV/EBITDA multiple of 8.7x and the exit year EBITDA is $14.6 billion. The present value of the terminal value is $11.7 billion. The total enterprise value or the sum of the present value of cash flows and terminal value is $15.5 billion. When we deduct the net debt from the enterprise value, we get the equity value which is worth $7.6 billion. Dividing the equity value by the number of shares gives us the equity value per share of $21.20. According to my DCF model, the stock seems to be overvalued by 9.4%. \\n\\n Sources: Nielsen and author estimates Dividend and cash flows Nielsen’s dividend was raised by 2.9% in April 2018. The dividend yield increased from 2.3% in 2015 to 6% at present. Both dividend growth and loss in stock value enhanced the dividend yield. The dividend payout ratio rose from 82.8% in 2015 to 155% at present. The decline in the EPS (earnings per share) is reflected in the increase in the payout ratio. Nielsen did not generate enough free cash flow in the nine months of fiscal 2018 to cover its dividend obligations. The company has decreased its share buybacks. Thus, the buyback yield has declined from 5.2% in 2015 to 0.9% at present. The company has $228 million left for share buybacks under its share buyback program as of Sept. 30. The operating cash flow guidance decreased from $1,300 million to $975-$1,025 million. Thus, the free cash flow outlook reduced from $800 million to $450-$500 million. Debt Maturities Strategic acquisitions, dividend payments, and share repurchases have been accompanied by expanding debt levels. The debt-equity ratio has increased from 1.6 in 2015 to 1.9 in 2017 and 2 in the nine months of fiscal 2018. The cost of debt is lower compared to equity which makes debt the preferable mode of finance.\\n However, the rising debt levels will affect the margins in the form of higher interest expenses. Nielsen is expected to maintain an interest coverage ratio (or EBIT per unit of interest expense) of more than two according to our calculations. Therefore, Nielsen should focus toward its EBIT margins to maintain a decent interest coverage ratio considering rising Fed rates. Refer to the chart below for Nielsen’s annual long-term debt maturities. \\n\\n Source: Nielsen presentation Strategic partnerships in December:  December 6 Nielsen Brandbank and Wakefern retailer allied to strengthen the latter’s online presence via private-label and national brand e-commerce and merchandising content. December 11 U.S. Chinese entertainment and news distributor Sky Link Media partnered toward best-informed buying decisions for agencies and media buyers through Nielsen’s local TV measurement services. Retail advertiser, Jerome\\'s Furniture Warehouse, renewed its alliance with Nielsen for the usage of Nielsen Local TV estimates to provide Jerome\\'s with access to Nielsen\\'s wide-ranging local currency TV rating data for Los Angeles and San Diego. December 20 Nielsen and Hearst Television renewed their agreement toward local and national television and radio ratings, behavioral insights and measurement services. Two sudden key executive suite exits New CEO Mitch Barns, 54, CEO since 2014, announced his retirement with the results for first half of 2018 in July. In November, big dData, artificial intelligence, cloud technologies, and media veteran David Kenny was appointed as the CEO effective Dec. 3, succeeding Barns. New CFO Jamere Jackson, 49, CFO since 2014, resigned as the CFO effective Sept. 10. David J.

That’s because it takes multi-million-dollar order tickets to get the attention and cooperation (including instant capital availability) of market-making firms. Such firms know where other latent buyers or sellers of specific stocks or ETFs are, and what prices it takes to get them to participate in a big trade. And then when all the immediate supply or demand is assembled, what it will cost the MMs to protect the capital they would have to put at risk to balance the supply and demand at the desired trade price acceptable to all involved. It’s the cost and details of that price-change insurance that tells what the outer bounds are of likely prices to be seen during the limited lives of the derivative securities that the insurance is based on. Let’s first look at what potential rewards and RISKS were seen back in Late August. Figure 1 \\n\\n (note: all materials from blockdesk.com have been approved for this article) The dotted diagonal line marks where upside and downside prospective price changes are seen equal. The numbered ETF industry symbols in the blue field at right locate the intersection of each ETF’s upside price gain prospect from the green horizontal scale with its price drawdown risk compatriot on the red vertical scale.\\n The market-index proxy SPDR S&P500 ETF (SPY) is at this map’s location [20], and is priced above $290. Few more attractive Reward~Risk tradeoffs are apparent. The “market” is the “safe” bet. Now let’s consider what is currently being forecast by the same criteria but on Christmas Eve for this same set of industry-oriented ETFs. Figure 2 \\n\\n Now there are dozens of industry ETFs which the MM community sees big-$ institutional clients eager to buy at current prices. All those ETFs in the green area have coming-price expectations 5 (or more) times as large as actual worst-case price drawdowns following buys at prior forecasts just like those of today. The market reaction of the days after Christmas suggests the MMs knew their clients pretty well. The big-money investors are more sophisticated than just making size trade-offs between risk and reward. They are also influenced by how likely each condition is to be present. To evaluate those concerns takes some additional information, contained in Figure 3. Figure 3 \\n\\n The more promising of ETFs in Figure 2 are detailed in this Figure 3 table from blockdesk.com. A key question of the moment is: Just how reliable are those forecasts on the green horizontal scale of Figure 2? To answer that, we assemble some outcomes from recent (past 5 years, daily) history. In column [M] we count the number of forecasts which were implied by the hedging actions taken by MMs. Actions taken to protect firm capital required to balance supply and demand in volume block trade orders.\\n Then we look to see in how many of those forecasts [L] the proportions of upside price change prospects to downside ones were like those of today. If there aren’t at least a dozen or more, then don’t take them seriously. For the ones which pass that test, then let’s see what has been their net payoffs [ I ] under a standard discipline of portfolio management. How do those payoffs compare to what price change rewards are being suggested by today’s upside prospect (between [D] and [B] ) shown in [E]? For the Regional Banks ETF (KRE) column [N] shows [ I ] to be 0.74 of [E]. Often the historical payoffs are more credible than the forecast upsides. Part of the payoff experiences is due to the mix of gains to losses in the comparable forecasts [L]. The Win Odds among them in [H] have a complement of loss occurrences. We don’t show how bad those losses actually are, but we keep track of the worst price drawdowns during the periods positions were held. The average of those worst-cases is reported in [F]. They represent the points of most emotional strain for investors embracing our standard Portfolio Risk Management Discipline, TERMD. That management process is a holding-period time-limited discipline when forecast sell targets are not reached within a maximum allowable investment of time. The worst-case price drawdowns are the most likely points where discontinuance of the continued time investment (to achieve a profitable recovery) may be chosen. Under the discipline the only way a loss occurs is when the holding time limit is reached and the position’s price is below its entry cost. Losses are reflected in the net payoffs of [ I ]. We use the actual odds [H] of profitable positions at their net payoffs [ I ], on one hand, together with the complement of [H] as odds of the potential for loss [F] on the other, as a means of conservatively projecting what prior experience may offer as coming potential experiences. This weighting of rewards and risks in [O] and [P] is added together in [Q] to give us a more qualitative measure of what may be expected as likely outcomes. One that may be justifiably ranked among alternative present investment candidates.\\n Further involvement of [Q] with the typical holding periods of prior forecast positions [ J ] refines the ranked scorecard some more into a commonly-used financial metric of basis points of return per day in column [R]. Conclusion The combination of an advantageous position in the equity investment transaction process, plus extensive information-gathering resources and continuous involvement in negotiations with those organizations managing sufficient capital to move market prices places the Market-Making community in a position to have valuable insights into likely coming prices for the shares of securities actively traded in volume. Their needed capital involvement to make volume transactions possible provides a means for us to measure their expectations of coming prices for those shares. Expectations which continue to demonstrate their value in securities selection, both as to issues and timing in thousands of cases in days across multiple years. This example offers the S&P SPDR Biotech ETF (XBI) as an illustration of likely near-term investment buy profitability in comparison with many others.

Recently the FDA accepted the company\\'s New Drug Application submission for KPI-121 0.25% (would be first product indicated for temporary relief of signs and symptoms of dry eye disease including flares), setting a PDUFA date of August 15th. Couple that with conviction size insider buying plus additional clinical catalysts in the coming year, and it certainly seems this one deserves a revisit. Chart \\n\\n Figure 1: KALA daily advanced chart (Source: Finviz) \\n\\n Figure 2: KALA 15-minute chart (Source: Finviz) When looking at charts, clarity often comes from taking a look at distinct time frames in order to determine important technical levels to get a feel for what\\'s going on. In the first chart (daily advanced), we can see a steady decline from the beginning of the year up to the present. In the second chart (15-minute), we can observe a bounce taking place (along with much of the biotech sector) but it remains to be seen whether it\\'s of the dead cat variety or truly turning around.\\n Overview In my initial write-up I touched on the following keys to the bullish thesis:  The company had submitted its NDA for Inveltys to the FDA- this was significant as if approved it\\'d be the first twice-daily ocular corticosteroid approved for use in post-operative ocular inflammation and pain. Market potential is substantial, considering the company\\'s cited figures that over 7 million ocular surgeries occurred in the United States in 2016 and that number is expected to peak above 9 million by 2021. I stated that due to superior convenience as compared to current 4x daily standard of care products, Inveltys was likely to see significant uptake if approved. The program also lent credibility to the company\\'s Mucus Penetrating Particle technology, which significantly improves penetration and distribution in ocular tissues (3 fold improvement observed in preclinical studies). Another product candidate to potentially create value I identified was KPI-121 0.25% for the temporary relief of signs and symptoms of dry eye disease, with NDA submission originally expected for the first half of 2018. As the first product for the short-term treatment of dry eye disease (two-week course of therapy), data from a mid-stage study provided further evidence of efficacy with the primary endpoint (bulbar conjunctival hyperemia at day 29) achieved with statistical significance (p=0.0387). However, I did note that statistical significance was not achieved for the primary symptom endpoint of ocular discomfort in one study (just \"promising trends toward improvement\"). Lastly, institutional positioning (including 10%+ owners Orbimed Advisors, Longitude Capital, and RA Capital Management) and an experienced management team (CEO and Chairman Mark Iwicki served prior at Civitas Therapeutics which was acquired by Acorda) appeared to be another good sign.  \\n\\n\\n Figure 3: Pipeline (Source: corporate website) My first thought is that this story is more appropriate for long-term investors (Inveltys launch into competitive space could be bumpy but ultimately successful)- however, I continually tell readers and ROTY members that it\\'s important to overcome prior bias and take second looks at stories we\\'ve passed upon in the past in case the thesis has changed significantly. I\\'m looking forward to seeing what we uncover here. Recent Developments On August 23rd the company announced that the FDA approved Inveltys for the treatment of post-operative inflammation and pain following ocular surgery. As noted prior, this was a significant development not only for the company (credibility boost) but also for markets being targeted (first twice-daily ocular corticosteroid approved for the indication which could help improve patient compliance versus current 4x/day treatment options). On October 2nd management took steps to shore up the company\\'s balance sheet and extend its operational runway, first with the closing of a $110 million credit facility (with funds from well-known investment firm Athyrium Capital Management)- the first tranche of $75 million was received upfront with the additional $35 million to be made available upon certain revenue milestone achieved for Inveltys or FDA approval of KPI-121 0.25% for dry eye disease. Apart from the above financing, the company also closed a secondary offering (8.625 million shares at a price point of $8.25 per share) for gross proceeds of around $71 million. Investment banks involved included JPMorgan, BofA Merrill Lynch, Jefferies, Cantor Fitzgerald, Wedbush PacGrow, and Oppenheimer. To my eyes, seeing both financings take place for a considerable amount of money relative to the company\\'s valuation had the look of \"raising what you can while you can\" - there\\'s certainly nothing wrong with that, but it could indicate to investors that management sees a drawn-out timeline for commercial launch or potential stumbles with dry eye program.\\n In late October the company announced a critical hire with the addition of Steven Zhang, M.D., Ph.D., as Vice President of Medical Affairs (served prior as Senior Director, Global Ophthalmic Franchise Medical Lead and Head of U.S. Ophthalmic Medical Affairs at Shire where he was involved with launch activities for Xiidra). Lastly, just yesterday the company announced that its NDA (New Drug Application) for KPI-121 0.25% was accepted for review by the FDA and given a PDUFA date of August 15th. \\n\\n Figure 4: Improvement in conjunctival hyperemia endpoint across multiple studies (Source: corporate presentation) Other Information For the third quarter of 2018, the company reported cash and equivalents of $74.9 million (doesn\\'t take into account October financings). Net loss totaled $15.6 million, while research and development expenses came in flat at $7 million. G&A more than tripled to $8.5 million as a result of prelaunch activities and building out of commercial infrastructure. Management is guiding for an operational runway through at least early 2020. As for future catalysts of note, commercial launch of Inveltys is expected in the first quarter of 2019. Topline data from the STRIDE 3 trial evaluating KPI-121 0.25% for the temporary relief of the signs and symptoms of dry eye disease is expected in the fourth quarter of 2019. PDUFA date of August 15th is an important material event as well (more on possible outcomes below). \\n\\n\\n Figure 5: Company estimate of market potential for treating dry eye flares (Source: corporate presentation) For readers who are interested in the story, I suggest listening to the Chief Medical Officer Kim Brazzell\\'s presentation at Jefferies Healthcare Conference. Here are a few nuggets that I found helpful:  The problem being addressed by the company\\'s AMPPLIFY Drug Delivery Technology is rather straightforward, namely that suspension-based drug products have a hard time penetrating mucus to target tissues (leading to lower efficacy). The company\\'s tech allows for improved penetration of this mucus barrier and increased concentrations of drug to get to target tissues, in this case, ocular (front of the eye/into the eye) for lead programs. Preclinical data with loteprednol etabonate (LE) showed 3 to 4 times higher drug was able to get into target tissues (aqueous humor and cornea) with Mucus Penetrating Particle (MPP) technology. LE is a novel steroid developed several years back for use in the eye with one key benefit being its rapid metabolization (lower probability of increasing intraocular pressure, common problem with other steroids). LE products on the market have a solid safety profile, but the problem is that potency in vitro has not translated to in vivo (due to poor penetration). As for lead product Inveltys (only one to have BID indication in this space), consider that eye care professionals (ECPs) prescribe steroids in 90% of cataract, glaucoma, and refractive surgeries. In most of these surgeries, steroids are prescribed and given 4x per day (patient also has to take NSAIDs 1-3x daily and antibiotic 2-3x daily). Management believes BID dosing alone makes Inveltys attractive over currently marketed products, but balanced safety/efficacy should also provide a leg up. On the downside, there is a significant amount of generic competition and about 30% of the market is branded products. A commercial launch going it alone in the US seems feasible considering that 6500 ECPs account for 80% of target business (company will cover with a 60 person salesforce). As for payer mix Medicare Part D accounts for around 37% and commercial plans do over half (52%). One point on the competitive profile of Inveltys I found interesting was that physicians have to choose between very potent steroids (which have higher risk of IOP increase) and less potent steroids that have better safety. Management believes Inveltys hits the sweet spot (similar potency to most effective products but with better safety profile) and company surveys show 88% of ophthalmologists recognize this advantage over existing treatments (81% report they are likely or extremely likely to prescribe Inveltys). As for market potential, management is guiding for peak sales of Inveltys of around $300 million. As for the dry eye program, the company is taking a differentiated approach by addressing episodic dry eye as opposed to chronic therapy like everyone else. Most DED patients don\\'t suffer continuously but instead experience flares or episodes (sometimes driven by seasonal changes or other triggers). Of 33 million people in the US with dry eye disease, around half have been diagnosed and only around 1 to 2 million are taking a chronic therapy (i.e. Restasis or Xiidra). If many of these patients experience around 5 or 6 episodes or flares per year, it makes sense they (and their physicians) don\\'t feel the need to be on a chronic therapy. One phase 2 study and two phase 3 trials have shown significant improvements in conjunctival hyperemia (endpoint agreed to by FDA) with high statistical significance achieved. On the other hand, improvement in ocular discomfort endpoint was hit in phase 2 study and STRIDE 1 study but not STRIDE 2 trial (had statistical significance for most time points but unfortunately not on day 15). Another reason for the STRIDE 2 \"failure\" was a small group of patients who entered the study coming in very symptomatic but whose symptoms were clearing up quickly (still entered study) and quickly went to zero regardless of on placebo or drug candidate (STRIDE 3 enrollment criteria amended to overcome this issue). Patients perceiving a significant treatment benefit in the first day or two versus waiting for much longer periods (months) for Restasis and Xiidra should be an important point of differentiation. Low incidence of instillation site pain versus 15% to 20% for Xiidra & Restasis is another point of differentiation and combined IOP data looks competitive as well. From commercialization strategy, the company has retained worldwide rights and plans to go it alone in the United States. \\n As for institutional investors of note, Orbimed Advisors and RA Capital Management have acquired significant stakes. Vivo Capital also owns a decent sized position. Significant insider buying at a price point of $8.25 back in October also stands out. Final Thoughts To conclude, Kala Pharmaceuticals appears to be an intriguing innovator in the ophthalmology space targeting substantial market opportunities with its lead programs. As a value play for patient investors this one makes sense- if peak sales of Inveltys were just half of management\\'s guidance (or $150 million) that would help justify the current market capitalization, while the dry eye disease program provides significant optionality (targeting blockbuster opportunity). For readers who are interested in the story and have done their due diligence, I can see the rationale for patiently accumulating shares with a multi-year time frame. As for risks, dilution in the near term does not appear likely given financings that took place in October. Setbacks or delays with ongoing studies and the commercial launch of Inveltys would weigh on the stock. Disappointing data for the STRIDE 3 trial would also deal a punishing blow to shareholders. Keep in mind that the dry eye program is not a shoo-in for FDA approval (as pointed out above with phase 3 data)- in a recent presentation management seemed to strike a cautious tone, as they hope the FDA will weigh all current evidence to approve KPI-121 0.25%. However, at the same time, the STRIDE 3 trial serves as a backup plan (i.e. in the event of FDA downthumb STRIDE 3 data would be forthcoming in a few months with opportunity to again file for approval after should endpoints be hit). Lastly, keep in mind indications being targeted have a high amount of competition including from generics and novel agents like Aldeyra Therapeutics\\' reproxalap. As for downside cushion and elements of derisking, one would think with upcoming commercial launch and steep decline in 2018 the stock is a prime candidate for a bounce. The high cash position post financing also provides a significant layer of protection, although in the event of obstacles encountered in commercial launch (drawn-out battle with competition, gaining coverage etc.) at some point cash burn will lead to the need for additional funding.\\n For our purposes in ROTY, I prefer to stick to stories with less in the way of competition (especially orphan market opportunities) and in 2018 short sellers have done well betting against many product launches (again, except for those in indications of high unmet need with limited competition).

While that has lagged the broad stock market, it has outperformed the yield oriented Vanguard Real Estate ETF (VNQ).  \\n\\nJPS Total Return Price data by YCharts Why now may be a great time to add preferred shares to your portfolio Preferred shares have been dealing with two separate threats. The first has been the interest rate hikes, which have made cash more competitive. That has also raised the borrowing costs for closed-end funds like JPS which use leverage via short-term funding.  The second and broader issue has been a recession fear which has whacked preferred shares and made them cheaper. The hit here has been a bit more indirect as preferred share funds NAV generally move in an inverse lock step with Baa yields. You can see below the peaking of JPS NAV just around when Baa yields bottomed.  \\n\\nMoody\\'s Seasoned Baa Corporate Bond Yield data by YCharts\\n Both issues have now been largely priced in to the stocks. While interest rates may increase further, the Federal Reserve is likely to slow the pace significantly, especially in the absence of any notable inflationary pressures. Baa yields are also likely peaking with fear of a recession reaching a crescendo late in this quarter. With both headwinds to NAV dissipating, JPS should be able to start moving its NAV higher and reducing its rather wide discount. Current discount While the broad-based selloff created a rather fantastic buying opportunity on December 24 with an almost 17% discount to NAV, the current price is still in cheap territory.  \\n\\n Source: Cefconnect.com The portfolio JPS, like many other preferred funds, leans heavily towards the banking and insurance sectors. \\n\\n Source: Nuveen JPS also holds a lot of international preferreds, and that has been another source of issue for it as the USD has been particularly strong. \\n\\n Source: Nuveen Another reason we like JPS here is that the USD is peaking in our view. As the interest rate hike outlook dims, USD should pullback from its lofty levels, allowing JPS NAV to improve. \\n Income should move higher, with a lag The rate hikes that have been implemented so far have already impacted JPS borrowing costs. However, its income moves up with a lag. As can been seen below, only about 13% of its securities are in the pure \"fixed\" category. \\n\\n Source: Nuveen The fixed-to-fixed rate securities are those that reprice at regular intervals to a new fixed rate (presumably higher) every few years. The fixed-to-floating rate securities are those that reprice at a predefined point in time to a floating rate, most often based on the rising LIBOR rate. Both these securities will yield more dollars for JPS should interest rates stay here or move higher. Conclusion The current 8.4% yield is highly attractive for a globally diversified preferred offering at a big discount to its NAV. We had previous mentioned that JPS should outperform the major indices over the next decade. Since then, however, stocks have retreated sufficiently and now we see many sectors with the potential of matching JPS returns over the next 5-10 years. However, JPS should be able to deliver the same return with significantly less volatility.  \\n\\nFundamental Chart data by YCharts Even with the market correcting, JPS still offers one of the heftiest spreads over S&P 500 (SPY) dividend yield and that represents a compelling value to us.

Q4’s rolling-over stock-market selling without big fear spikes is ominously classic bear-market behavior. The next bear is long overdue.Unprecedented full-speed Fed QT colliding with bubble-valued US stock markets artificially inflated by long years and trillions of dollars of Fed QE can’t end well. The reckoning is upon us.Major bear markets follow major bull markets, often cutting stock prices in half over a couple years or so. And these inexorable bull-bear cycles are very unforgiving.'], 'article': ['Stock markets are forever cyclical, an endless series of alternating bulls and bears. And after one of the greatest bulls in US history, odds are a young bear is now gathering steam. It is being fueled by record Fed tightening, bubble valuations, trade wars, and mounting political turmoil. Bears are dangerous events driving catastrophic losses for buy-and-hold investors. Different strategies are necessary to thrive in them. This major inflection shift from exceptional secular bull to likely young bear is new. By late September, the flagship US S&P 500 broad-market stock index (SPX) had soared 333.2% higher over 9.54 years in a mighty bull. That ranked as the 2nd-largest and 1st-longest in US stock-market history! At those recent all-time record highs, investors were ecstatic. They euphorically assumed that bull run would persist for years. We humans naturally extrapolate present conditions lasting way out into the indefinite future. But long centuries of stock-market history have painfully proven that no bull lasts forever. Eventually they all lead to inherently-unsustainable fundamental, technical, and sentimental excesses. These can only be bled away and ultimately normalized by bear markets. So bull markets have always been followed by bears. Bulls and bears are easily defined technically, 20%+ SPX moves uninterrupted by opposing 20%+ moves. The greatest stock bull in US history was the SPX’s 417.0% run over 9.46 years between October 1990 to March 2000. That climaxed in the tech-stock bubble, when wild optimism about stock-market fortunes reigned. Yet that soon gave way to tears as the subsequent bear mauled the SPX 49.1% lower in 2.6 years!\\n Stock investors suffering their wealth getting cut in half is typical in major bears. But the losses extend well beyond capital into far-more-scarce time. After that turn-of-the-century secular-bull peak, the SPX wouldn’t power decisively above those levels again until 12.9 years later in early 2013! That’s nearly a third of the 40 years average investors have between the ages of 25 to 65 to generate wealth to finance retirement. If you can’t afford to lose half your stock-market wealth, and you don’t have time to wait for well over a decade for stock prices to fully recover, you better take this quarter’s market developments very seriously. Something snapped in the US stock markets in early Q4 ’18, and the price action and volatility since reeks of a young new bear. While that diagnosis can’t be certain until the SPX falls 20%+, the signs are ominous. As Q4 ’18 dawned, the US Federal Reserve ramped its quantitative-tightening campaign to full speed. QT is necessary to start unwinding 6.7 years of quantitative easing ending in October 2014, during which the Fed conjured $3625b out of thin air to monetize bonds! QE was considered necessary to stimulate the economy after the Fed forced interest rates to zero in December 2008 during the first stock panic in a century. Those trillions of dollars of QE capital injected by the Fed directly levitated the stock markets, artificially inflating an already-mature bull market to monstrous proportions. All those bonds accumulated on the Fed’s balance sheet, which skyrocketed 427% higher over that relatively-short QE span! The Fed can’t maintain $3.6t of bonds on its books forever, so it finally started letting them gradually roll off at maturity in Q4’17. That unprecedented QT capital destruction started small, but was ratcheted up each quarter until Q4 ’18 when it reached its terminal velocity of $50b per month. The SPX achieved its latest all-time record high in late September, and then October was the first month ever of full-speed QT. The QE-levitated stock markets wilted under this QT onslaught, which was inevitable sooner or later. I warned about all this in advance.\\n Just a week after the SPX peaked in late September, I published one of my most-important essays ever. I unambiguously titled it “Fed QT is Bull’s Death Knell”, and it explained the stock-market impact of Fed QE in depth and why full-speed QT was certain to slay this bull. With the SPX just 0.6% under its recent record high on that final day of Q3 ’18, that warning fell on deaf ears. Maybe investors will pay attention now. Fed QT is no flash in the pan, it is a long-term persistent threat to these lofty stock markets. In order to merely unwind half of that unfathomable $3.6t of Fed QE, full-speed QT at $50b per month will have to run for 30 months starting in Q4 ’18. Heading into 2019 the stock markets face another 27 months of this! And the Fed is loath to slow or stop its QT now underway on autopilot, as that could unleash panic-grade selling. The Fed has long asserted the reason it is undertaking QT and has hiked rates 9 times since December 2015 is the US economy is strong. It wants to rebuild easing-ammunition stores to use in the inevitable coming recession. If the Fed caves on QT before its balance sheet shrinks much lower, traders will assume the Fed fears the US economy is in serious trouble. So they would flee stocks pummeling them far lower. The die is cast on Fed QT, guaranteeing the long-overdue next stock bear. And the losses seen so far are just a small vanguard of what’s to come. This first chart superimposes the mighty SPX bull of the past decade on its so-called fear gauge, the VIX S&P 500 implied-volatility index. The recent Q4 trading action in both is unlike anything yet seen in this entire bull. It is looking far-more bear-market-like in character. \\n\\n Major stock-market selloffs are defined based on size. Anything under 4% isn’t worth classifying, it is just normal market noise. Then from 4% to 10%, selloffs become pullbacks. In the 10%-to-20% range they grow into corrections. And of course beyond that at 20%+ they are in formal bear-market territory. This selloff snowballed darned close to beardom on Christmas Eve, the SPX plunging to a 19.8% loss over 3.1 months!\\n Just 4 trading days earlier before the latest FOMC decision, it was only down 13.1%. While that latest Fed rate hike was expected, the future-rate-hike outlook among top Fed officials wasn’t dovish enough for stock traders. Despite all the market carnage since the previous dot plot, their effective forecast for future rate hikes was merely lowered from 4 more to 3. So the SPX plunged 7.7% over the next 4 trading days! Even before that this selloff hasn’t behaved like a normal bull-market correction. Their purpose is to vent excessively-bullish sentiment, rapidly bleeding off greed. Sharp selloffs are necessary to do that. Traders don’t get worried until stocks fall fast enough and far enough to shatter their complacency. So normal bull-market corrections are usually front-loaded with sharp selloffs that trigger soaring levels of fear. Prevailing fear levels are inferred by the VIX, which technically measures the implied volatility in 1-month SPX options. Before last peaking in late September, the SPX suffered 5 bull-market corrections within its epic secular bull. Heading into July 2010 the SPX fell 16.0% in 2.3 months. That spawned some real fear, as evident in the VIX soaring to a 45.8 peak. The effective fear ceiling outside of panics and crashes is a 50 VIX. The next SPX correction cascaded 19.4% lower over 5.2 months ending in October 2011. Despite its long span, the VIX skyrocketed as high as 47.5 in its midst. That was real fear, the kind necessary to slay exuberant greed and rebalance sentiment to keep an ongoing stock bull healthy. After that the SPX went a near-record 3.6 years without a single correction-grade selloff in an extraordinary levitation driven by the Fed. That’s when its unique open-ended third quantitative-easing campaign was in full swing. QE3’s peak year was 2013 which saw the Fed monetize a staggering $1020b of bonds! The SPX soared 29.6% higher that year on such vast liquidity injections. But 2014 saw QE bond buying collapse to $450b as the Fed tapered QE3. The SPX only rallied 11.4% that year, its gains shrinking 62% in proportion with QE3’s 56% decline.\\n The QE3-goosed stock markets wouldn’t correct again until well after QE3 ended, the SPX sliding 12.4% over 3.2 months into August 2015. Again the VIX surged to 40.1, which is up in the very-high fear zone. The next debatable correction followed right after. The SPX didn’t achieve new highs after the previous one, so it was technically one compound correction instead of two separate ones. Analysts render it both ways. That second correction or second part of the longer one saw the SPX fall 13.3% over 3.3 months into February 2016. That was the only bull-market exception that didn’t see a high VIX, it merely climbed to 28.1 at best. But since the VIX had just recently surged over 40 in a fear climax, another one apparently wasn’t necessary. That rolling-over SPX action into early 2016 actually looked more bear-like than bull-like. Provocatively it took fully 13.7 months after that May 2015 topping for the SPX to finally hit new highs confirming its bull was alive. The thing that short-circuited what felt like a young bear was hopes for more European Central Bank easing after the UK’s surprise Brexit vote in late June 2016. Then the SPX again exploded higher in November 2016 after Trump’s surprise presidential victory with Republicans controlling Congress. Optimism and greed exploded on hopes for big tax cuts soon, fueling a powerful stock-market surge into early 2018. The SPX then corrected sharply into early February with a 10.2% plunge in just 0.4 months. The VIX shot up to 38.8 on that, showing real fear. All bull-market corrections with the lone exception of the second part of that compound one exhibited telltale fear spikes averaging VIX peaks way up at 43.1. But the recent SPX selloff of Q4 ’18 coinciding with the first-ever full-speed Fed QT looks way different. It has been mostly an orderly, gradual selloff generating modest fear. The highest VIX close between late September and pre-FOMC in mid-December was merely 25.8! Even on Christmas Eve it only hit 35.8. These are too low for normal sharp bull-market corrections, this fear profile is looking more like a bear downleg.\\n While bull-market corrections are supposed to shock and scare, bear-market downlegs start more subtlety. Instead of plunging fast then stabilizing, bear selloffs start slow then gather steam later. Bears begin in stealth mode, only gradually rolling over to prevent fear from spiking. Without big fear to wake them up and scare them out, investors complacently stay deployed as their losses slowly and inexorably mount. Like the proverbial frog slowly being boiled alive, investors don’t realize the peril their capital is in during bear markets until way too late. The lack of normal bull-market-correction fear spike during this latest correction-grade selloff disturbingly suggests a new bear has awoken. And coming after such a massive and largely-artificial QE-inflated stock bull, the fearsome bear QT has to spawn should be proportionally large. On Christmas Eve the SPX was forced close to a 20% bear-cub loss at 2345. That level was first seen in February 2017, and represents nearly 3/4ths of the post-Trump-election taxphoria rally being wiped out. 30% would drag the SPX back down to 2052, which were November 2014 levels right after the QE3 bond monetizations ended. 40% would crush the SPX to 1758, back to October 2013 levels killing 4.9 years of gains. But after one of the biggest and longest stock bulls in US history, it would be shocking if the subsequent bear didn’t lop off at least 50%. Especially given this bull’s artificial QE-inflated nature in an era where QE-conjured capital is being destroyed by QT. A 50% SPX loss from late-September’s peak would leave it at 1465. Those levels were first seen in this bull all the way back in September 2012, 6.0 years earlier. While a 50%+ bear warning may sound sensational or overly dramatic, it’s actually fairly conservative. The SPX already suffered two bear markets since the tech-stock bubble peaked in March 2000. The first one ending in October 2002 mauled the SPX 49.1% lower over 2.6 years. The second one climaxing in the first stock panic in a century drove a far-worse 56.8% SPX decline in just 1.4 years ending in March 2009.\\n 50% bears are totally normal after large bulls, even when they don’t have the amplifying dynamics of the first-ever colossal-scale Fed QE and QT. This overdue next bear has a great chance of growing bigger than normal after such a monstrously-grotesque bull. Most investors won’t figure this out until too late. Unlike bull-market corrections, high-fear VIX spikes soaring into the 40-to-50 range don’t ignite until later in bears. While the extreme Fed tightening under this unprecedented full-speed QT campaign could easily drive a major stock bear alone, so could excessive valuations. When the SPX peaked in late September, its 500 elite stocks were collectively trading at literal bubble valuations! Extreme valuations are what usually cause stock bears, which exist to force stock prices back into line with corporations’ underlying earnings. The classic honest way to measure valuations is through trailing-twelve-month price-to-earnings ratios. These take companies’ last four quarters of actual hard GAAP earnings, add them up, and divide them by companies’ prevailing stock prices. Unlike fictional forward earnings, real past results aren’t mere guesses about the future. Over the past century and a quarter or so, the US stock markets averaged a 14x TTM P/E. That’s long-term historical fair value, which is logical and reasonable. The reciprocal yield of 14x is 7.1%, an interest rate that is mutually beneficial to both pay and be paid for investment capital. Twice that at 28x earnings is the formal bubble threshold. As of the end of September just after the SPX peaked, its elite companies averaged a TTM P/E well into bubble territory at 31.4x earnings. They were dangerously overvalued. This next chart looks at average SPX valuations in TTM P/E terms over the past couple decades or so. The 500 SPX components’ simple-average P/E is rendered in light blue. The dark-blue line shows it instead weighted by companies’ market capitalizations. The SPX is superimposed over the top in red, while a hypothetical fair-value SPX at 14x earnings is shown in white. This valuation picture is ominously damning.\\n \\n\\n The bubble valuations around the SPX’s late-September peak were nothing new. They had been above that 28x threshold continuously for 14 months since July 2017. Stocks were already expensive before Republicans swept the November 2016 elections kindling those exuberant big-tax-cuts-soon hopes. But they got a lot more expensive after that as stock prices soared way faster than corporate earnings since. Again excessive valuations are what normally spawn stock bears. Stock prices get bid up too fast during bull markets for underlying earnings to justify. So bears follow bulls to drag stocks lower or just sideways for long enough for corporate profits to catch up with prevailing stock prices. These mean reversions after large bulls usually see valuations overshoot towards the opposite extreme before bears give up their ghosts. So odds are this young stock bear won’t head back into hibernation until the stock markets’ average TTM P/E ratio per the elite SPX components actually falls under 14x. Major bears usually bottom with the SPX P/E in the 7x-to-10x earnings range, the former being half fair value when stocks are very cheap and screaming buys. Late in the last stock bear climaxing in March 2009, the SPX’s TTM P/E slumped to 12.6x. But let’s be conservative and just assume this next bear, even with Fed QT, merely mauls stocks long enough to force a fair-value 14x P/E with no overshoot. Assuming corporate earnings don’t grow much which is a real possibility during a serious stock bear, that implies 51% downside from the SPX’s late-November levels. That was the latest month-end valuation data available when this essay was published. Historical fair value sans earnings growth implies a bear-market bottom near SPX 1356, or 53.7% under late September’s peak! That’s right in line with historical major bear markets, nothing unusual. As bears generally last a couple years or so, modest underlying corporate-profits growth could lift that valuation-based bottoming target maybe 10% or so. That still implies a 49.1% total bear which isn’t to be trifled with.\\n The combination of wildly-unprecedented full-speed Fed QT slamming QE-inflated stock markets trading at bubble valuations is incredibly menacing. Seeing bear-market-like rolling-over selling behavior without big fear spikes in recent months strongly argues the overdue bear has awoken. But since all that selling has been concentrated fully within a single quarter, odds are most investors don’t realize how bad things are. The biggest group of investors with the most capital are casual retirement investors who don’t closely follow the markets. They avoid much work and stress by paying other people to manage their money. These investors get statements showing their portfolios’ fortunes after every calendar quarter. At the end of Q3’18, everything still looked awesome with the SPX just 0.6% under its all-time high of a week earlier. So the Q4’18 statements due out in January could prove shocking, spawning fear and galvanizing bearish psychology. The most-widely-held stocks in investment funds are the biggest and best ones led by the market-darling mega techs. While they were radically overvalued at the end of Q3, no one cared at that point. Everyone owned the largest US stocks including Apple, Amazon, Microsoft, Alphabet, and Facebook. Add in the last FANG Netflix, and these 6 stocks alone commanded over 1/6th of the entire market cap of the SPX just before the Q4 selling started! Their average TTM P/E was a scary 80.2x earnings, 2.6x the entire SPX’s. Yet these beloved companies were believed to have such amazing businesses that they should be immune to economic slowdowns or stock-market selloffs. That myth was obliterated in Q4. This SPX selloff first hit 10%+ correction territory on Black Friday with a 10.2% loss from its peak. On that same day, mighty Apple, Amazon, Microsoft, Alphabet, Facebook, and Netflix had collapsed 25.8%, 26.4%, 10.8%, 19.9%, 39.4%, and 38.2% from their recent all-time highs! They averaged 26.8% losses, or 2.6x the SPX’s. Many if not most investors’ Q4’18 portfolio results are going to look even worse than the SPX.\\n Will they start fleeing and adding to the selling pressure when these gaping holes in their precious capital are revealed? And while record Fed tightening and a mean reversion lower out of bubble valuations are the primary bear-market risks, they aren’t the only ones. The trade wars between the US and China and other countries are intensifying, and US political turmoil will soar next year with Democrats controlling the House. The epic corporate stock buybacks that helped levitate the stock markets in recent years will wane as the Fed forces interest rates higher. Trillions of dollars of these buybacks were debt-financed over the past decade. And as stock markets fall, Americans will feel poorer and spend less. This negative wealth effect will really weigh on record corporate profits, potentially driving them lower forcing valuations even higher. The Fed’s QT isn’t the only howling central-bank headwind stock markets face. The European Central Bank is also halting its own massive QE bond monetizations starting in January! That will suck even more capital out of the system. Many of these bearish factors for stocks feed on each other too, with all combined wreaking more havoc on sentiment and stock prices than individual ones ever could in isolation. Investors really need to lighten up on their stock-heavy portfolios, or put stop losses in place, to protect themselves from this young bear market. It’s only just beginning, with sub-20% SPX losses at worst a far cry from 50%+. Cash is king in bear markets, since its buying power grows. Investors who hold cash during a 50% bear market can double their stock holdings at the bottom by buying back their stocks at half-price. Put options on the leading SPY S&P 500 ETF (SPY) which perfectly mirrors the SPX can also be used to hedge downside risks. But options trading is risky, with 100% losses possible if the timing doesn’t work out. And cash doesn’t appreciate in value. So the best bear-market investment is gold, which tends to rally on surging investment demand as stock markets weaken. Gold investment grows wealth during stock bears.\\n Gold surged 30% higher in essentially the first half of 2016 in a new bull initially sparked by those late-2015 and early-2016 SPX corrections. Investors fled burning stocks and flocked to gold. And the gold miners’ stocks really leveraged those gains, rocketing 151% higher in that same timeframe. The gold stocks are not only wildly undervalued, but just breaking out technically which should accelerate their upside. The bottom line is a young stock bear sure looks to be awakening. Q4’s rolling-over stock-market selling without big fear spikes is ominously classic bear-market behavior. And after such a monster bull, the next bear is long overdue. Unprecedented full-speed Fed QT colliding with bubble-valued US stock markets artificially inflated by long years and trillions of dollars of Fed QE can’t end well. The reckoning is upon us. Major bear markets follow major bull markets, often cutting stock prices in half over a couple years or so. And these inexorable bull-bear cycles are very unforgiving, as it can take over a decade for stock markets to regain bull highs once a bear starts ravaging. Gold is the refuge of choice, seeing investment demand surge as stock markets swoon. Prudent investors deploying in gold can grow their wealth during stock bears.

Company Overview: Vanda Pharmaceuticals (VNDA) is a Washington, D.C. based biopharmaceutical company that was founded in 2002 and came public some five years later. The company is focused on developing and commercializing novel therapies to address high unmet medical needs. Vanda Pharmaceuticals currently has a market cap of approximately $1.3 billion and trades for just under $25.00 a share. The stock has approximately tripled since I first wrote about it just over two and a half years ago. \\n\\n Product Portfolio & Pipeline: The company currently has two approved products, Hetlioz and Fanapt. Hetlioz has been approved for non-24 and is in development for non-24 pediatric, Smith-Magenis syndrome, and jet lag. Fanapt has been approved for schizophrenia in the United States. The company\\'s pipeline also includes tradipitant for atopic dermatitis and gastroparesis, and VTR-297, an early stage asset, for hematologic malignancies. In recent news, on October 22nd, 2018, the company received a warning letter from the FDA in relation to the company\\'s website content for Fanapt and Hetlioz. The letter states that the website contains false and misleading information about the benefits of both therapeutics and omits risk information. Fanapt has a black box warning. On October 23rd, the company modified the content of their webpage. And of their Q3 earnings call of November 7th were still working with the FDA to resolve the issues.\\n \\n\\n Source: Company Presentation \\n\\n Source: Company Presentation Hetlioz: Hetlioz is a melatonin receptor agonist, which has been approved by the FDA in January of 2014 for the treatment of Non-24-hour sleep-wake disorder. Furthermore, Hetlioz was approved by the European Commission in July of 2015 for the treatment of Non-24 in totally blind adults. Non-24 is a chronic, circadian rhythm disorder that affects the body\\'s internal clock, disrupting the sleep-wake cycle. This causes significant distress and/or impairment in all aspects of life. Non-24 affects most totally blind individuals, and it is estimated that approximately 80,000 Americans have the disorder. \\n\\n Source: Company Presentation Net product sales for the third quarter were $29.9 million, which is a quarter-over-quarter increase of 7% and a year-over-year increase of 34%. Turing to development, the enrollment in the company\\'s clinical study of Hetlioz in Smith-Magenis syndrome is complete. The results of the study came out in early December and were mixed as the drug hit one of two primary endpoints in the trial. Also, the company submitted a supplemental New Drug Application to the FDA for Hetlioz in jet lag disorder which was accepted on December 20th.

Company Overview: Vanda Pharmaceuticals (VNDA) is a Washington, D.C. based biopharmaceutical company that was founded in 2002 and came public some five years later. The company is focused on developing and commercializing novel therapies to address high unmet medical needs. Vanda Pharmaceuticals currently has a market cap of approximately $1.3 billion and trades for just under $25.00 a share. The stock has approximately tripled since I first wrote about it just over two and a half years ago. \\n\\n Product Portfolio & Pipeline: The company currently has two approved products, Hetlioz and Fanapt. Hetlioz has been approved for non-24 and is in development for non-24 pediatric, Smith-Magenis syndrome, and jet lag. Fanapt has been approved for schizophrenia in the United States. The company\\'s pipeline also includes tradipitant for atopic dermatitis and gastroparesis, and VTR-297, an early stage asset, for hematologic malignancies. In recent news, on October 22nd, 2018, the company received a warning letter from the FDA in relation to the company\\'s website content for Fanapt and Hetlioz. The letter states that the website contains false and misleading information about the benefits of both therapeutics and omits risk information. Fanapt has a black box warning. On October 23rd, the company modified the content of their webpage. And of their Q3 earnings call of November 7th were still working with the FDA to resolve the issues.\\n \\n\\n Source: Company Presentation \\n\\n Source: Company Presentation Hetlioz: Hetlioz is a melatonin receptor agonist, which has been approved by the FDA in January of 2014 for the treatment of Non-24-hour sleep-wake disorder. Furthermore, Hetlioz was approved by the European Commission in July of 2015 for the treatment of Non-24 in totally blind adults. Non-24 is a chronic, circadian rhythm disorder that affects the body\\'s internal clock, disrupting the sleep-wake cycle. This causes significant distress and/or impairment in all aspects of life. Non-24 affects most totally blind individuals, and it is estimated that approximately 80,000 Americans have the disorder. \\n\\n Source: Company Presentation Net product sales for the third quarter were $29.9 million, which is a quarter-over-quarter increase of 7% and a year-over-year increase of 34%. Turing to development, the enrollment in the company\\'s clinical study of Hetlioz in Smith-Magenis syndrome is complete. The results of the study came out in early December and were mixed as the drug hit one of two primary endpoints in the trial. Also, the company submitted a supplemental New Drug Application to the FDA for Hetlioz in jet lag disorder which was accepted on December 20th. The PDUFA date is scheduled for mid-August of next year. Lastly, in September, the company released data from their driving study that demonstrated no impairment of next day driving performance.\\n \\n\\n Source: Company Presentation Fanapt: Fanapt is a serotonin (5-HT2) receptor and dopamine receptor antagonist, which is approved for the treatment of schizophrenia in adults.

The graph below is showing the yearly distribution. \\n\\n I have estimated that the Royal Dutch Shell activity represents 44.8% of the total backlog of the company ($5.57 billion). These contracts are firm, and if terminated for convenience, Transocean will be compensated by an amount above 80% of the total backlog remaining, making them ultra safe. Note: The Shell backlog has been revised lower starting July 2018 after the company applied a \"day rate reductions on four of the company\\'s newbuild drillships related to cost de-escalations attributable to down-manning.\" These reductions represented an estimated ~$500 million. The Deepwater Conqueror kept its day rate at $583K/d while the others average now $474K/d from $519k/d previously.\\n The graph below is showing the early participation of the Shell backlog compared to the total backlog. \\n\\n Transocean is essentially an ultra-deepwater business with more than 70.3% of the backlog attached to the Ultra-Deepwater portion. However, with the acquisition of Songa Offshore, the semisub segment Harsh-Environment (mainly the North Sea) represents 29.2% of the total backlog as of Dec. 28, 2018. \\n\\n Conclusion and Technical Analysis The fleet analysis is an excellent business indicator that demonstrates the underlying strength of Transocean compared to most of its peers, even if some observers describe the company as \"over specialized\" in the floater business. With a substantial backlog of $12.4 billion the company is likely to keep its dominant position in this volatile and competitive sector as the last contract awarded by Chevron confirm again. It\\'s not the jack-ups\\' segment that will trigger the decisive turnaround that we are waiting. While the recovery in this segment is evident, the day rates and gig duration are too low to make a real difference in the backlog except for this prime long-term, five-year contract with Chevron which comes at the perfect time for Transocean which took me by total surprise. As we all know, the key to survival lies in the floaters\\' segment, especially in the ultra-deepwater part (drillships). It\\'s even more critical for Transocean after the company sold its entire Jack-up fleet to Borr drilling.\\n The floater\\'s segment is the one that needs to get revived, and it\\'s happening at a painfully slow pace. Worse, the recent oil crash starting October has been a real challenge for investors who were waiting for a full recovery in 2019. With oil prices back to the low $40s it\\'s hard to keep optimistic. Despite this good news, I see very few opportunities for the Drillships sector at the moment. The fact is that backlog has been regularly eroding since 2015, and without the recent Songa Offshore acquisition and the Ocean Rig merger, the backlog would have probably sank below $9 billion by now. However, this $830 million of an additional backlog is felt like electro shock in the industry and change the backlog dynamic. However, we need more than good news to believe that the \"train has left the station. \"Therefore, it is evident that the stock price will fluctuate widely depending on future oil prices, and the best investing solution is to trade at least half of your holding using a short-term technical strategy. Technical Analysis \\n\\n RIG has suffered a terrible correction since October and may have reached support just below $6.50 (I recommend buying at this level assuming that oil prices will not test the $30s next year). It\\'s too early to search for any logical upper resistance at the moment, and venturing an honest opinion is not possible without a well defined technical pattern. However, If RIG price continues to creep higher, I will take some profit off my last accumulation around $8 which is a probable first resistance.

This continues the recent streak that we have been seeing of contract awards across the offshore drilling industry. It also shows us that Rowan continues to be the strongest company in the offshore drilling space, at least to my mind. The market though has not been particularly kind to the company as of late, which may partly be a function of the ongoing decline in oil prices that we have been seeing over the past few months. About The Contracts The contracts that were awarded were both for harsh-environment jack-up rigs. This makes some sense as jack-up rigs are Rowan's specialty, despite its attempt to move into the ultra-deepwater space during the drilling boom. The two rigs involved were the Ralph Coffman, which secured a 180-day contract in Trinidad, and the Joe Douglas, which secured a two-well extension of its current contract with BP (BP), also in Trinidad. I wrote about several days ago, the Ralph Coffman is the same rig that secured a contract with CGX Resources (OTCPK:CGXEF) offshore Guyana for next Spring. In that article, I lamented that the contract had no options attached to it and now we know why. The contract that was just signed is for 180 days in Trinidad beginning in April 2019. As a result of this contract, the one with CGX Resources has been moved to commence after this new one, so the rig will likely begin working in Guyana sometime next fall.\\n One thing that this latest development shows us is the willingness of oil companies to have their contract commencement dates moved around in order to work with Rowan while firms like Ensco (ESV) still have a sizable number of unemployed jack-up rigs. This does serve as evidence of the desirability of this company's rigs, which are also among the most modern in operation today. This is certainly something that investors will appreciate as Rowan should clearly be one of the top beneficiaries of any improvement in the offshore drilling industry. The second positive development was the exercise of a two-well option for the Joe Douglas by BP. The Joe Douglas is a harsh-environment rig of the same design as the Ralph Coffman that is currently working in Trinidad and not on the Norwegian Continental Shelf, which is where we would normally expect to find these rigs. The exercise of these two options extends the rig's employment until May 2019, which should boost the company's cash flow over the first two quarters in 2019 compared to where it was prior to the announcement. It also allows Rowan to remain fully contracted for a longer period of time, which is unique among the major drillers. As has been the case with many of the recent contract awards in the offshore drilling space, Rowan did not disclose what the dayrate was on either of these contracts. In addition, the contractor did not state who the contract for the Ralph Coffman was with. This is partly due to the company not wanting to affect the market by disclosing the dayrate. With that said though, IHS Markit puts the current leading new contract dayrate for harsh-environment jack-ups at about $60,000: \\n\\n Source: IHS Markit It is worth noting though that these figures are specifically for harsh-environment rigs operating in Northwest Europe, which is not the case here. Bassoe Offshore estimates about the same level though, so it seems to be a reasonable estimate. The problem with this figure though is that it is barely at cash flow breakeven levels, so we cannot expect Rowan to be generating much in the way of positive cash flow off of these contracts. However, it is still better than the rig being out of work, so the contract award is still a good thing.\\n The same is the case for the Joe Douglas as Rowan's most recent fleet status report shows an undisclosed dayrate for the contract with BP, but we can assume that the options were around the same price as Rowan is receiving now. Although the dayrate is undisclosed, I would not be surprised if it is also around the $60,000 level given the recent trends in dayrates. Thus, the same comments would apply here in that the cash flow from these extensions would likely be negligible, but it is still better than the rig being out of work. Stock Price Performance Rowan's stock price performance over the fourth quarter has been incredibly disappointing. Since peaking at $20.70 on October 7, 2018, Rowan's stock price has fallen 58.41% to $8.61 per share: \\n\\n Source: Fidelity Investments It seems likely that the decline that we have witnessed in oil prices over roughly the same period is at least partly responsible for this. As we see here, oil prices have declined by 40.61% since the beginning of October: \\n\\n Source: Nasdaq The general fear here is that if oil prices remain low, then the world's exploration & production companies will be less interested in drilling for oil offshore should oil prices remain low due to the cost of producing oil offshore. This is really more of a problem in the ultra-deepwater environment than the shallow-water one though as shallow-water production costs are somewhat comparable to onshore costs. The fact that Rowan continues to receive contracts in spite of this price decline is also an indication that companies do continue to be interested in the space. Personally, I think the bigger concern here is that we are unlikely to see any sort of recovery in dayrates over the near- to medium-term.\\n On Thursday, December 27, Piper published a note stating that Rowan shareholders are less likely to approve the merger with Ensco following the recent sell-off. This note caused Ensco shares to decline, but it is uncertain whether or not it had any effect on Rowan's stock price. As I have stated before, I am not fond of this deal since it seems that Ensco benefits much more than Rowan does as Rowan is already very well-positioned to weather the industry weakness and is certainly doing quite well for itself, all things considered. From my perspective, it will be a good thing if Piper is correct and this deal is scuttled. It is quite possible that the possibility of the deal going through is weighing on Rowan's stock price though, considering that Rowan shareholders would receive 2.215 shares of Ensco stock upon consummation of the merger; so, as the value of this consideration goes down, so does Rowan's potential future price. Conclusion In conclusion, these two contracts greatly extend the visibility of Rowan's backlog and show that the company is remaining fundamentally strong in the face of a weakening macroeconomic environment. The stock price has certainly not reflected this though, which is rather disappointing. I do not see a whole lot of investment potential until the merger with Ensco is cancelled though, due to the potential lost value from the consummation of it. The company is certainly worth following though as we may have an opportunity in the stock once the deal fails, if it does.\\nAt Energy Profits in Dividends, we seek to generate a 7%+ income yield by investing in a portfolio of energy stocks while minimizing our risk of principal loss.

Sell GBX into earnings.\"], 'article': [\"\\n\\nMetro Forensics Greenbrier Companies (GBX) reports quarterly earnings January 4, 2019. Analysts expect revenue of $561.32 million. The revenue estimate implies flat growth Y/Y. Investors should focus on the following key items. Revenue Is Likely In The Bag Greenbrier manufactures, repairs, refurbishes, and provides management services for companies that lease railcars. Over 80% of the company's revenue is derived from the manufacture of railcars. The rest comes from leasing and the sale of parts and supplies. \\n\\nIn FQ4, the company had 6,000 railcar deliveries, up from 5,500 deliveries in the year earlier period. The increase in deliveries was 9% Y/Y, which helped drive Manufacturing revenue higher by 12%. The fact that next quarter's revenue growth is expected to be relatively flat implies railcar deliveries could slow. Greenbrier had diversified orders of 9,300 railcars last quarter, valued at over $1.0 billion. Its new railcar backlog was 27,400 units with an estimated value of $2.7 billion. Next quarter's revenue is already included in the backlog. The quarter's actual performance will likely be based on exactly how many orders are delivered from the backlog. The backlog is robust, which is a good thing.\\n Last quarter, the company's gross margin ticked down to 15% from 16% in the year earlier period. The biggest variance was in the Manufacturing sector whose gross margin fell by 200 basis points. It could have been due to an unfavorable mix of business, but if the trend continues, it could impact sentiment for the stock. EBITDA margin was 12%, flat Y/Y. I would have expected some margin expansion given the increase in scale. SG&A expense was $51 million, which gives the company another lever to pull in order to increase margins. Lack Of Visibility Over New Orders Industry railcar orders have been white-hot. Railcar orders for the industry were 24,972 for Q3 2018, up 188% versus the year earlier period. Greenbrier's orders for its FQ4 2018 were 9,300, up 272% Y/Y. On its last earnings call management was ebullient about future railcar orders: Recent railcar orders excluding multi-year deals have been robust with 9,000 units booked in our fourth quarter and 15,000 booked in our second half, a strong trend. Visibility for us remains strong and we remain optimistic. During fiscal 2018 we achieved several key milestones; we delivered 21,000 railcars, our highest total since 2015. And we received railcar orders at our highest level in three years. We ended the year with orders for 21,900 to 22,000 railcars valued at $2.2 billion. We were especially encouraged by the momentum in the second half as I've said. In my opinion, vital signs of the economy do not suggest strong railcar orders will persist. For the week ending December 22nd, rail traffic and intermodal units were up 4.2% compared with the same week last year. Total carloads were up 1.7% for the first 51 weeks of the year. I do not believe rail traffic is robust enough to keep railcar orders at their current pace. Weak industrial production implies there will be less need to ship goods and services by rail. Catalysts that spurred the economy and business fixed investment may have abated. Without quantitative easing and more tax cuts, U.S. economic growth may continue to slow. In that sense, Greenbrier's future railcar orders and deliveries will likely not reflect its recent past.\\n Conclusion GBX is off over 20% Y/Y. Railcar orders and the stock have likely peaked. Sell GBX.\\nDisclosure: I/we have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours. I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions.

But this is a good thing. Why? Because sentiment and positioning is resetting precisely at a time when the long-range weather outlook shows a much better set-up. Now keep in mind that the long-range is not always accurate, but positioning/sentiment wise, if a colder than normal outlook is the set-up by the end of January just as positions get washed out, that may present the bullish trade opportunity we are waiting for.

Morien Resources (OTC:APMCF) (MOX on the TSX Venture Exchange) owns royalties on two mining projects based in Nova Scotia, Canada. The Donkin Coal Mine commenced production in the first quarter of 2017 and the Black Point Aggregate Project was permitted in the second quarter of 2016, and is progressing toward a development decision. The Donkin coal mine is owned by Kameron Collieries, a private company controlled by billionaire Chris Cline. The mine produces and sells thermal and metallurgical coal and has reserves of 483-million tonnes. With two thick seams and high energy content of 14,000 British thermal units per ton, Donkin's coal reserves are easily convertible into high-value coke for steelmaking. The Donkin royalty pays Morien as follows:  Morien gets a 2-percent Net Smelter Return royalty on the first 500,000 tonnes of coal sales per quarter Morien gets a 4-percent Net Smelter Royalty on any tonnage that exceeds 500,000 tonnes per quarter.  Morien is debt free, has no capital expenditures and Donkin royalties generate practically all of its revenue. That means figuring out Morien's free cash flow is pretty simple.\\n Free Cash Flow = (Coal Price x Production) - General and Administrative Costs - Taxes The calculation is so simple, Morien created a calculator on their website so investors could figure out the dividend in different scenarios. The company uses a range of USD $60 to $150 per tonne to project annual royalty payments between $4.0 million and $8.5 million at full production of 2.75-million tonnes per year. A conservative estimate is usually advisable, but the range of coal prices and production estimates used by Morien doesn't reflect global demand and pricing. Setting the floor at a more accurate US$130/tonne Donkin produces mostly metallurgical coal used in steelmaking and is close enough to a deep water port that its low-cost coal can be shipped anywhere in the world. Both the thermal and metallurgical coal from Donkin meet the quality standards to fetch higher-end market prices. Earlier this year S&P Global Platts pegged the price of high-grade met coal at US$186 per tonne, while benchmark seaborne thermal coal prices jumped to US$120.10 per tonne, its highest level since 2012. \\n\\n China's coal production and demand play a crucial role in international prices. On Arch Coal's third-quarter conference call, CEO John Eaves noted steel demand growth has helped spur a nearly 5-percent pickup in seaborne coking coal demand at a time when coking coal supply remains under pressure.  While Chinese imports are lagging last year's levels modestly, Chinese steel and coke producers have consistently returned to the seaborne market, each time coking coal prices have retraced. And in the end demand continues to surge higher with the promise of significantly more growth in the coming decade. As we noted on past calls, investment in new coking coal production have been quite constrained in recent years, both during and in light of the most recent market trough. The upshot has been very fragile supply network that is easily stressed as we've seen in the recent weeks and issues at several mines across the globe that serve to push prices much higher. Layer on to that supply challenges, an equally fragile logistics chain, and you have a recipe for continued strength in the coking coal markets. In addition, steel producers who are seeking to capitalize on the recent steel price strength are wringing out additional volumes at the mills. That tends to favor the higher-quality coking coals that can reduce coking times and facilitate higher utilization levels. \\n Putting aside the noise caused by the Trump tariffs, global demand for high-quality iron, steel and coke, combined with disappointing supply growth, should keep met coal prices near US$200/mt through 2019 at a minimum. Admittedly I don't know the exact breakdown of Donkin's output between thermal and met coal. But an estimated sale price of US$130/tonne is still extremely conservative while more accurately reflecting the reality of the global coal market. Bumping the production floor to 3-million tonnes/year Kameron's original production guidance for Donkin included reaching full production of 2.75 million saleable tonnes over a three-year period. After running into equipment issues and laying off 49 workers late last year, production at Donkin seems to have steadily increased in 2018 with a new mine plan and new mining equipment to carry it out. A company official told local media the mine's growth at the end of 2018 will see production of one million tonnes of coal a year, with approval to mine up to 3.6 million tonnes a year. Given the Cline Group's reputation for operational efficiency and the current production trajectory, my production estimate is 3-million tonnes by the end of 2019. Plugging in the numbers Let's plug in our revised numbers and Morien's cost estimates and see what we come up with as an estimate of 2019 free cash flow.   Donkin Coal Sale Price (USD $/tonne) $130 Revised estimate based on rising met coal prices.   Est. Transportation & Related Deductions (USD $/tonne) ($10) Source: Morien Resources   Net Coal Price (USD $/tonne) $120     USD / CAD Exchange Rate 1.36 Based on the Bank of Canada closing price: 12/26/2018   Donkin Production (mln tonnes/year) 3 Revised estimate based on new mine plan   Donkin Royalty revenue @ 2% (CAD $ mlns) $6.5 2-million tonnes   Donkin Royalty revenue @ 4% (CAD $ mlns) $6.5 1-million tonnes   Black Point Aggregate (CAD $ mlns) $0.1 Morien receives a minimum royalty of $25,000/quarter, credited against future production royalties.   Total Royalty Revenue (CAD $ mlns) $13.1     G&A (CAD $ mlns) (0.7) Source: Morien Resources   Taxes at 31% (CAD $ mlns) ($3.8)     Net After Tax Free Cash Flow (CAD $ mlns) $8.6     Fully diluted shares outstanding (mlns) 58.575     Estimated shares repurchased (mlns) (1.62) Based on 2017-2018 share repurchases. Morien has bought back 15% of its shares since 2015   Estimated fully diluted shares outstanding (mlns) 56.96     Net Cash (mlns) $4     The numbers above, and a share price of CAD $0.44 based on the Christmas Eve closing price in Toronto, give us an Enterprise Value of $21.06-million. That gives us an estimated free cash flow yield (after tax FCF/EV) of 40% based on our conservative coal price estimate and fully ramped up production. Risks Morien is a royalty company, but the usual risks with any mining company investment apply - including falling commodity prices and changes to the regulatory environment. The second risk is that Morien has very few catalysts ahead of it. Kameron Collieries is a private company, so there are no public updates about Donkin's development. The reason I'm making estimates about production and pricing at all is the lack of press releases that a public company would make highlighting favorable drill results, metallurgical test work and other signs that the project is moving forward. Morien investors have to infer this from management presentations, global coal pricing and news from Donkin, which could take 3-4 years to reach full production in a worse case scenario. Finally global trends in coal demand give a good directional indicator, but aren't specific to Donkin. Kameron Collieries has had several customers test out Donkin coal, but so far Nova Scotia Power is the only customer to enter into a long-term purchasing agreement. Conclusion Given the lack of visibility into the quality of coal, uncertainty about pricing and production, general commodity risk if a global recession hits and the fact Morien is a microcap, a free cash flow yield of somewhere between 15-20% is probably more appropriate. That suggests a fair value for Morien shares between CAD $0.75 and $1 in about a year's time. But as a low-risk royalty stream that could last for decades, the reason for the Morien's aggressive share buybacks and management buying stock in the open market becomes obvious: Morien shares are trading at half their fair value.\\nDisclosure: I am/we are long APMCF.

Tesla closed Thursday at $316 and although it traded with the market most of the day, it resisted the last-hour rally that had the Dow climbing 800 points in just over an hour. There are many great deals on the market right now from a valuation basis and if you are looking for a low-risk investment, I can assure you that Tesla is not one of them. Tesla still holds a premium valuation and it must continue to impress investors to sustain or grow that valuation. For Tesla, exceeding expectations mean that it must continue to sustain business growth as well as demand. In a few days, the cost of all Teslas will rise by $3750 as the federal tax credit halves, and in July, it will halve again assuming the Trump Administration hasn\\'t eradicated it by then. Economically speaking, price and demand are directly correlated, so if Tesla is unable to counter the lack of a credit with lower-priced vehicles, then technically speaking demand will fall. Fortunately, the short-term remedy for this is to start shipping cars overseas where customers in Europe have already placed orders on the Model 3 before seeing the car in person. While this means that American demand comes into question, I find that demand remains strong and that there are many strategies that can be used to sustain demand outside of a price reduction.\\n What I learned from visiting a local Tesla Store There are many reports and Seeking Alpha analysis arising over Tesla\\'s ability to meet sales expectations, many being skeptical. Some articles pointed out a few hundred Model 3s parked on Tesla\\'s store lots claiming that supply was outstripping demand. That is quite a lot of cars for a single store. On my way to work last week, I decided to stop by my local Tesla store and learned that they had 90 deliveries scheduled for the weekday. I\\'ve worked for multiple Honda dealers and delivering 10 cars on a weekday was a pretty good day. Delivering 90 over an entire weekend (including Friday) was a great weekend even at a busy dealer here in Southern California. As for inventory in storage, dealerships can have as much as 1,000 cars on their storage lot; smaller dealers selling 200 cars per month can have as much as 500 on hand (that\\'s just interest being paid to the bank by the way). All of a sudden 400 cars on Tesla\\'s lot doesn\\'t sound very big, especially when you compare that story to when Tesla had several thousand Model 3s sitting on lots earlier in July while the company went through \"logistics hell\". It seems that those cars have been delivered. Of course, in the grand scheme of it all, 90 units from a single store in a single day is not enough information to tell the full story, but as someone who\\'s spent a few years at automotive retailers, that discovery was staggering. Depleting backlog does not mean sales will collapse A common argument against Tesla is that it\\'s thriving on a shrinking backlog of Model 3 orders that came over the years. In the auto industry, having a backlog of any amount of orders is unusual and rare, but for Tesla, this has been quite typical. Getting a customer to order a vehicle online and sight-unseen is not something that exists outside of Tesla minus a few exceptions such as new EV start-ups, limited production vehicles, and exotics. I worked at Honda through many great redesigns such as the 2016 Civic, 2017 CR-V, and 2018 Accord and prior to their launch, inquiries about these vehicles were scarce and these are still amongst the top-selling cars on the market. The millions of cars in the US sold each month occur at a physical store without pre-orders or online orders. Tesla is rapidly expanding its store footprint, such as the 11 stores it opened earlier this month, and with more stores, there are more opportunities. In fact, unlike a standard dealership in some locations walking into a Tesla store and asking for a test drive means making an appointment for a later time or date.\\n Sales ban in some states limits demand In a few states such as Texas, the direct-to-consumer sales model has been banned. To counter this, in some areas, Tesla has opened \"Galleries\" that showcase its cars and allow customers to see and experience one in person, but the sales ban is so strict that Tesla isn\\'t even allowed to talk pricing to customers that visit these galleries. Purchasing a Tesla in Texas means ordering one online, registering it in a neighboring state and trucking it over to your home state. Unfortunately, the states that ban direct sales of Teslas are losing millions in tax revenue to neighboring states and as Tesla\\'s sales and production figures rise, the missed tax opportunity becomes more dramatic. This will undoubtedly yield frustration and possibly the reevaluation of the rules against Tesla as it grows into a larger company. In Texas, a state that bans direct sales of Tesla, sales tax is 6.25%. At that rate, for every 1,000 Teslas sold at an average price of $50,000, the state loses over $3 million in sales tax revenue. Dealerships are some of the largest taxpayers and this has provided them with a strong influence over Congress, which has, in turn, led to the ban of Tesla because it skips the middleman. However, the dealer association\\'s argument against Tesla is weak. The purpose of the old franchise law is to protect manufacturers like Toyota (TM) and Honda (HMC) from opening stores across the street of its existing franchises. Tesla has no existing franchise stores, and this is largely why Tesla has found success over the years against what once a very wide ban across the country. Tesla hasn\\'t challenged the laws in many of these states, but where it has, it has found some success whether it being allowed to open a very limited number of stores or a store at all. Such an advantage would allow more customers to freely inquire, test drive, and make purchases of Teslas without the use of loopholes. Other ways Tesla can sustain demand Aside from being able to open an actual store and conduct a sale without prohibition of the law, there are many ways for Tesla to generate demand in the US. Tesla does not spend hundreds of millions like traditional automakers on advertising to sponsor a home run or be in a Super Bowl commercial. It relies on word of mouth, customer referrals, and as long as its demand outstrips supply, it will continue to do so. Tesla still has a lot of people to educate about its product; sales reps often tell me how often customers ask if its cars burn gasoline.\\n Leasing Is Very Important For Luxury Vehicles Another way to secure a large number of sales is via leasing. Leasing has grown in popularity over the years and Tesla\\'s lack of Model 3 leasing options has many buyers including myself waiting for that option. Leasing, especially with premium brands is extremely important. The Model 3 is aiming to be a mass-market vehicle but purchasing one today means having a monthly loan payment of $800 for seven years after putting $5,000 down. With a lease, Tesla could drop this figure substantially and given the high resale value of its cars, it may be comparable to the competition\\'s lease offerings. A Mercedes Benz C300 with an MSRP of $42,500 and leases for $419 per month with $4,100 due at signing and a BMW 3 Series 330i with an MSRP of $42,000 leases for $369 per month with $4,200 due at signing. BMW has far more aggressive incentives than Mercedes, but given Tesla\\'s good resale value, which is what leases are based on, plus a $3,750 federal tax credit, it is likely that a $46,000 Mid-Ranged Model 3 would lease similarly to the Mercedes. Given that the average payment of a leased car is $448 per month this September, being around or under that threshold opens the door to many customers especially those wanting to first try before buying. Conclusion While Tesla scrambles to sell as many cars as it can by the end of the year, it will only be a few days into 2019 where we can see just how many units were delivered. When I walked into that small Tesla store on a weekday, I was very impressed to see that they had 90 deliveries scheduled for the day. I can only imagine that this figure is even greater these last few days of the month and this is just one of dozens of stores here in California. After the tax credit ends, Tesla\\'s goal from serving the US will move into Europe and Asia where there are likely thousands of orders waiting to be fulfilled. In the US, the tax credit has flushed forward a vast amount of sales but to say that sales will drop like a cliff is to say that sales of BMWs and Mercedes will no longer exist. Tesla has been outselling competitive brands very successfully not because of a tax credit, but because of a desirable product. The Model 3 outsells all sedans from BMW and Mercedes, including the much more affordable CLA and 3 Series Models that are thousands of dollars cheaper even without credits.\\n Going forward, Tesla\\'s product expansion becomes very important. Fortunately, Tesla still plans on introducing a $35,000 Model 3 and as economics goes, when you reduce the price of a product demand rises conversely. In terms of product expansion, Tesla intends on moving into the compact SUV market in late 2019 with the Model Y, which will be challenging top-sellers such as the Rav4 and CR-V. Given similar pricing to the Model 3, I believe the Model Y will be even more successful than the 3.\\nDisclosure: I am/we are long AAPL, TSLA.

With just two trading sessions left for 2018, low volatility is alone for posting a year-to-date gain among the major US equity factors, based on a set of ETFs. The iShares Edge MSCI Minimum Volatility USA (BATS:USMV) is up fractionally for the year through yesterday's close (Dec. 27). The fund's 0.6% total return is effectively a flat performance, but even this spare gain compares rather well against the rest of the field, which is under water in varying degrees for 2018. The biggest year-to-date setback for the main US equity factors is in small-cap value stocks: iShares Core S&P Small-Cap (NYSEARCA:IJR) has lost a hefty 13.8% so far this year. The prevalence of red ink across most of the equity factor scorecard is understandable, given the negative tailwind for equity beta generally. Indeed, the US stock market overall is suffering this year, based on the SPDR S&P 500 (NYSEARCA:SPY), which is down 5.3% year to date on a total-return basis. \\n\\n Although nearly every corner of the US stock market is struggling as the year comes to a close, the breadth of the performance gap at the extremes of the factor horse race is striking. All the more so when you consider that small-cap value had been outperforming low volatility this year by a wide margin as recently as late-August. The subsequent reversal of fortune, however, has been swift and deep, providing low vol with a wide 14 percentage-point performance edge over small-cap value in 2018, as of yesterday's close. \\n\\n\\n Despite low vol's relatively strong performance vs. small-cap value and other slices of US equity factors, the technical profile for iShares Edge MSCI Minimum Volatility USA doesn't look particularly encouraging at the moment. A key question for the ETF in early 2019: will the 50-day moving average for USMV succumb to gravity and fall below the 200-day average? So far, that trend indicator has remained bullish, but with the rest of the market under pressure, it's open for debate if USMV can continue to buck the trend in the new year. \\n\\n Meanwhile, investors looking for a contrarian play will be watching IJS in 2019 for hints that the worst has passed. It's not yet obvious that the point of maximum capitulation has arrived, but after months of pummeling, it's a safe bet that small-cap value deserves to be on the short list for a possible rebound on the assumption that reversion to the mean will kick in at some point. \\n\\n\\n\"]}\n",

It\\'s running out of time to prove it.\\' I tend to agree. Ethereum (ETH-USD) has been hailed as a technology innovative enough to usher in a new internet, a new legal system, and new payment systems-all three based on its \\'smart contract\\' platform. And, yet, we\\'ve seen a great deal of speculation behind this, sending ETH prices near $1,500 and then the deflation down below $100 once many realized that technology is not here. And not just that, but the technology that is here has some serious flaws: mining ETH has become unprofitable, and the ETH blockchain is over 1TB. Technological innovations have been promised to meet these problems, but that takes serious time with such a new technology that has no intermediary party to fully \"release\" updates as a company might, and it distracts the developers from the kind of disruption that Ethereum promised. But it\\'s fully needed. As the MIT article explains, thanks to a 2018 Ethereum-based site called CryptoKitties, the world saw: The mad rush to breed them led to a sudden sixfold increase in transaction volume that clogged the network and slowed Ethereum to a halt. It exposed the truth: the technology is immature, incapable of handling the kinds of workloads that big dapps would demand. From there, it went on: The problem Buterin [Ethereum\\'s founder] and a few trusted collaborators have spent years laboring to crack is that the fundamental weaknesses of Ethereum, and the reasons why CryptoKitties was able to bring it crashing down, stem from the very core of how almost all existing cryptocurrencies are built. Constantinople These lingering issues are meant to be addressed in the Constantinople upgrade scheduled for mid-January 2019. It has some bullish potential. Just the announcement of the upgrade\\'s date sent ETH prices up 10% (though the rest of the market went up that day, so it could be a residual effect of a Bitcoin (BTC-USD) price increase).\\n The biggest part of the upgrade is the decreasing of the mining block reward from 3 ETH to 2, which will reduce the incoming and inflating supply of Ethereum. Analysts are calling this bullish, but that has to be long-term thinking. Though it\\'s not completely set (graphed below), the Ethereum blockchain produces about 6,000 blocks per day, so the incoming supply will decrease by that amount per day as it\\'s run throughout 2018. \\n\\n There\\'s already over 100 million ETH in circulating supply, so the difference here will be minimal in any short term. Long term, yes, the Constantinople upgrade can affect the supply and demand economics of Ethereum, and if smart contracts start to utilize ETH and its \"gas\", this will matter. But we\\'re just weeks away from that upgrade, and I - someone who follows Ethereum closely - can\\'t point to a single promising app or site using smart contracts. So, there\\'s going to be a limit to an already large pool that\\'s mostly being underutilized. The End of ICOs The more bullish idea for me for ETH is the end of the ICO craze. New crypto companies are looking less for public raising of funds - mostly done through ETH - and are exploring other methods. This is a net positive for ETH, even if it slows demand for getting coin to get in on ICOs. Why? Because when an entire financial ecosystem of young, unestablished companies is creating or distorting ETH value, you have days where companies that raised $200 million and then dumped 200,000 ETH this month. That dump, along with other high-raising ICOs emptying their treasuries has wreaked havoc on the market this year. Without ICOs, interested ETH investors will hold their ETH in hopes of future value coming. And what will that value look like?\\n Network Usage Here are charts on ETH daily transactions and ETH price. Look similar right? \\n\\n \\n\\n The correlation here is likely trading. As demand raised, so did transactions as daily trading volumes soared. What ETH will need is a dissociation from daily trading and actual network usage outside of price valuation. That means that enterprises are using smart contracts on a consistent basis, and decentralized apps are running as they are meant to. If ETH is merely a tradable commodity, which it looks like it will continue being in Q1 2019, there\\'s no value proposition for holders, and especially none now that ICOs are down. We can see near the end of the graph that transactions are holding while price dips. This could be a good thing - the start of that dissociation. But it will take much more, a return to highs in daily transactions and well beyond that (3-5x I think) for ETH to have the kind of value that benefits holders. Conclusion Constantinople is a net positive for the network, and the long-worked-on Casper will be as well (to be discussed in future articles); but ETH will need more coming in the next months to increase its value as a transactional utility before it returns to the heights - in price and in premise - as the game changing technology that so many have flocked to.\\nBitcoin may have come down from the stratosphere, but there’s still an abundance of opportunities in cryptocurrencies.

Nonetheless, I am optimistic that 2019 will be a much better year for the industrial company, and I believe investor pessimism with respect to GE has seen its low in 2018. General Electric is my top rebound bet for 2019 that could produce high risk-adjusted returns for investors. Though GE could test its most recent lows, the risk/reward remains very attractive as long as General Electric is out-of-favor. A Year In Review It was a devastating year for General Electric: The company continuously disappointed investors throughout 2018 with poor earnings, the announcement of an SEC investigation with respect to the company's insurance reserves, a scrapped dividend, and the appointment of yet another Chief Executive Officer. To top things off, General Electric has so far failed to restructure its ailing power business which is in a prolonged slump. Adding insult to injury, General Electric's stock got booted from the Dow Jones Industrial Average earlier this year, too. On the back of such developments, General Electric's share price slumped 58.3 percent this year, making it the worst performing investment for a lot of investors. Testing New Lows? Market volatility roared back in the fourth quarter with a vengeance. On the back of deteriorating investor appetite and decreasing investor confidence in the U.S. economy, stocks have corrected sharply to the downside since October. General Electric's shares, for instance, dropped to a devastating 52-week and multi-year low @$6.66. Two years ago, GE traded at ~$30.\\n Though GE is now longer oversold, and managed to bounce back up to $8 in December, shares could very well test this year's lows in case investor sentiment takes another hit. Should GE fall through its latest lows, this would point to more downside for GE's stock over the short haul. \\n\\n Source: StockCharts GE In 2019 General Electric will focus on three major businesses going forward: Aviation, Power and Renewables, which will make up GE's new core business. The power business, which brought in ~$35 billion in revenues in 2017, will be the center of investors' attention in 2019. GE took a $22 billion impairment charge in its power division in the third quarter of 2018, and investors will closely monitor management's progress with respect to the restructuring. Should GE's new management be able to turn things around in light of a weak gas turbine market (and in the absence of a U.S. recession), investor sentiment could gradually recover and improve prospects for share price appreciation.  In any case, General Electric will not be the same company in the future that it is now. General Electric will execute on its strategic actions plan in 2019 that calls for a healthcare spinoff and the divestiture of its stake in Baker Hughes, an oil field services company General Electric bought in 2016. Here's GE strategic action plan: \\n\\nSource: General Electric  There are also more asset sales in the cards for 2019. General Electric has loosely guided for $20 billion in asset sales, and the company could step its divestiture game up next year in order to shed underperforming businesses and raise cash. Together with the dividend, General Electric could potentially invest billions of dollars in new growth initiatives in sectors such as aviation, digital and renewable technologies. In 2018, for instance, General Electric sold its rail business to Wabtec in a $11.1 billion deal and agreed to sell its Distributed Power Business to private equity company Advent International for $3.25 billion.\\n Valuation General Electric is dirt cheap, and has a very attractive risk/reward, in my opinion. Though downside risks exist with respect to both the U.S. economy and General Electric's ability to restructure its power business, GE's shares are priced for disaster, selling for less than nine times next year's estimated earnings. \\n\\nGE PE Ratio (Forward 1y) data by YCharts General Electric has widely underperformed its peers in the sector, Honeywell International (HON) and 3M Company (MMM), especially since October. Here's how GE compares against its industrial peers in the sector in terms of forward P/E-ratio. GE's earnings multiple today is about half the earnings multiple of its closest peers. \\n\\nGE PE Ratio (Forward 1y) data by YCharts Risk Factors Investors Need To Consider There are three major risk factors that could affect the investment thesis negatively: 1. General Electric fails to turn around its power division, and, as a result, cash flow and margin problems continue to weigh on GE's financial performance and investor sentiment in 2019; 2. A U.S. recession (should it manifest itself) could hit GE's cyclical industrial businesses, such as aviation and oil & gas, hard; 3. Should GE's stock price fall below the most recent low at $6.66, more downside looms over the short haul. Your Takeaway General Electric is taking massive action right now, and there are reasons to be optimistic and give management time to execute on its turnaround plan. Management is super focused on driving this restructuring home, and will leave no stone unturned to show improved capital efficiency going forward.\\n Honestly, I can't see how things could get much worse from here, and GE's shares are already priced for disaster. So much bad news is already baked into General Electric's valuation that the industrial company can almost only surprise to the upside in 2019. GE remains widely out-of-favor, which points to huge recovery potential next year as investor sentiment could gradually shift if GE's financial performance improves. I am prepared to add to my long position if GE drops below the latest low at $6.66. GE is my top stock pick for 2019. \\nDisclosure: I am/we are long GE.

Trade war and global growth slowdown concerns continue to weigh on the nickel price, despite rapidly-falling LME nickel inventories. Nickel price news As of Dec. 24, the nickel spot price was US$4.90/lb, about the same as US$4.86 last month. The London Metals Exchange (LME) inventory fell yet again for the month (see LME graph below). Nickel spot prices - five-year chart - USD 4.90/lb  \\n\\n  Source: InfoMine.com LME nickel 5 year inventory The chart below shows nickel inventory levels have declined and are now back to 2013 levels when the nickel price was ~USD 6-8/lb.  \\n\\n  Source: InfoMine.com Nickel demand v supply  On Dec. 23 Investing News reported: Nickel outlook 2019: No boom, but batteries loom. Nickel was as hard hit as other base metals in 2018 as investor sentiment bled the markets, leading to lower prices even as demand increased. Analysts predict that nickel prices will stay low through to 2019, barring any significant improvements in the seemingly deteriorating US-China trade rhetoric. In their last commodities forecast report for 2018, analysts at Focus Economics note that increased output from Indonesia and the Philippines has been pushing prices down, and plans to build a new Class 1 nickel-cobalt refinery in Indonesia are ensuring any bullish attitudes to the metal are tempered. China’s Tsingshan (the world’s largest stainless steel maker), announced that the refinery will be producing battery-grade nickel (50ktpa) and cobalt. Stefan Ioannou of Cormark Securities said.... “I think the reality in the case of the battery narrative is that yes, I think nickel at some point will have a place to play there, but it’s a few years out yet in terms of actual consumption of the metal in that space. So I think it may have been a bit premature, and I think the market has recognized that as well. Drawing down on the above thoughts on supply and demand, each analyst predicted either a stable or higher nickel price in 2019 — with the trade war weighing down on prices even if supply and demand push them up. “Should the trade dispute be resolved sooner rather than later and/or China provides a new stimulus package for internal growth, then that would be positive for the price outlook.... Panelists see nickel prices recovering considerably over the next 12 months amid a tight market.”\\n Back in 2017 I wrote in my Norilsk Nickel article on Trend Investing: The nickel boom maybe just starting now, or more likely it will be in the period from 2018-2020, mostly depending upon demand from the stainless steel and construction industry (led by China, and soon India). Increasing adoption of EVs with an increasing nickel share in the Li-ion battery will also help drive demand, again more likely towards 2020 when EV volumes are more significant. The chart below shows nickel is forecast to be in deficit after ~2022 (or at least require new supply to come online). \\n\\n  Source: Wood Mackenzie Note: Some others such as BMI have been forecasting a nickel surplus by 2020 due to increased Indonesian production and reduced Asian demand. \\n\\n Source: Sherritt presentation May 2018 Nickel Market News A recent interview from The Assay from energy metals expert Chris Berry gives his views on nickel: It is a stretch to believe that demand from the electrification theme will be the sole driver of higher nickel prices. Nornickel sees batteries at 15% of nickel demand in 2025, up from 4% in 2017, and clearly battery end uses will compete with the stainless steel market for nickel units going forward. Forecasts for nickel demand from the EV sector are quite broad with a range of between 370,000t to 525,000t by 2025, up from 34,000t today. This is a huge jump, but still only a relatively small part of a much larger nickel market.....To be clear, should the forecasts around more nickel-heavy cathodes be accurate (and I believe they are), we are going to need more nickel to come to market, but the scenario for structurally higher nickel prices is a longer-term phenomenon.\\n Nickel Company News Producers Vale SA (NYSE:VALE) Vale plans a US$1.7B Voisey\\'s Bay expansion plan to boost their nickel production.

Nornickel has terminated its agreement to sell African assets to BCL Group, including a 50 percent stake in the Nkomati joint venture. The notice of termination was submitted to BCL on 20 December 2018. The termination results from BCL Group’s serious breaches of contract. Nornickel’s termination of the agreement means that it will no longer be requiring the BCL Group to purchase Nornickel’s interest in the Nkomati joint venture. Instead, Nornickel will continue to seek damages from BCL for the significant loss it has suffered as a result of BCL’s failure to honour its obligations. The termination of the agreement will also enable Nornickel to pursue its own strategy for the African assets.\\n Investors can read my very recent article \"An Update On Norilsk Nickel.\" BHP Group [ASX:BHP] (NYSE:BHP) In 2017 BHP announced a US$43.3m investment in its Nickel West project to enable conversion to nickel sulphate.

Between now and the 29th of March, Britain’s political and economic climate will hit unprecedented levels of volatility. If you haven’t been following the Brexit turmoil over the past two years, the BBC has a convenient summary page with all the latest developments. The bottom line is that the British public and politicians are divided over whether to leave the EU without a trade deal, sign up for the Prime Minister’s unsatisfactory deal, or have another referendum in order to stay within the EU. It doesn’t matter what happens. For the currency and equity market, the uncertainty has already driven wild swings. This makes the market ideal for traders over the short-term, and excellent for value investors seeking a bargain over the long-term. In my opinion, one of the best opportunities is a company that dominates a stable market, operates in a defensive sector, has extensive exposure to emerging markets, and derives the vast majority of its sales from outside the United Kingdom. Diageo (DEO) fits that bill perfectly. \\n\\nSource: Wallpapercave London-based alcoholic beverages giant Diageo generated £12.2 ($15.44) billion in net sales and £3.7 ($4.68) billion in net profit last year. The vast majority of these sales were completed outside Great Britain. In fact, more than a third of sales came from North America, and 20% originated from Asia Pacific.\\n With over 75 different brands sold across 180 countries, Diageo is one of the most well-diversified beverage companies in the world. This diversification and scale means Diageo’s prospects are more correlated with the global economy than British politics. Brexit-proof \\n\\n Source: Express Diageo management recently said Brexit could cost it tens of millions of pounds if Britain failed to strike a convenient trade deal with the rest of Europe. Nearly 24% of sales originated in Europe (including Turkey). At stake is the company’s Scotch Whiskey, Guinness stout and Baileys liqueur. Scotch alone constitutes 25% of the company’s total volume (it’s their biggest category). A customs border in Northern Ireland will impact the latter two while Scotch exports from Scotland need a favorable trade arrangement. However, tens of millions of pounds are just a drop in the $15 billion revenue bucket. CEO Ivan Menezes admitted as much when he said, “Given our global footprint, and our ability to trade tariff-free in Europe, we can handle Brexit in our stride.” Although there’s no denying the fact that tariffs and trade disruptions will have a direct effect on volumes sold across the region, another facet is the volatility of the pound. Diageo has 80 offices spread across 180 countries. All sale are completed in local currencies, of course, but the cumulative figure is translated to pound sterling for reporting. This means a sudden devaluation of the pound could lead to an inorganic rise in reported sales and profits. In fact, since 34% of sales are generated in North America, Diageo’s bottom-line hinges on the cable (USD:GBP) exchange rate. The currency gains could offset some of the economic damage from a no-deal Brexit.\\n No matter how you look at it, Brexit doesn’t seem like an existential crisis for the company. However, the political drama at Westminster coupled with ongoing global trade tensions has butchered the British stock market. The FTSE 100 is down 13.5% year-to-date. DEO, meanwhile, is down 4.1% over the same period. Maybe it’s time to take a closer look at the company’s valuation. Valuation \\n\\nDEO data by YCharts [object HTMLElement] Although the stock trades at 25x price-to-earnings, Diageo is better value based on its hefty dividend. The stock offers a 3% dividend yield at its current market price and management has already promised a £2 ($2.53) billion buyback programme for the ongoing financial year (called “the F19 Programme”). So far, the company has bought back 46,479,212 shares with another £1.4 billion yet to be deployed. Using the dividend discount model assuming next year’s dividend will grow by 2.5% to $2.1 and the required rate is 3.5%, the intrinsic value works out to $210. That implies a 33% discount to intrinsic value. Final Thoughts Britain faces genuine economic uncertainty with the prospect of a messy Brexit looming over every issue. This makes the London market ideal for bargain hunters. In my opinion, Diageo is a rock-solid dividend paying stock with great prospects, excellent management, and extensive diversification. They own a recognizable, premium alcohol brand in nearly every part of the world. Considering the fact that management is buying back stock, dividends are growing steadily, and Brexit disruptions are likely to have minimal impacts, Diageo is worth a closer look.\\nDisclosure: I/we have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

We conclude with our views on whether MAIN is still an attractive security to own or if it’s time to look elsewhere. \\n\\n The above chart provides perspective on the strong performance of MAIN versus the S&P 500 and a BDC index. Overview: Located in Houston Texas, MAIN has more than $4 billion of investments under its management. The company invests mainly in the debt (and some equity) of middle market companies (i.e. companies with annual revenue between $10 million and $150 million). Its objective is to maximize total returns by generating current income and capital appreciation. Here\\'s a look at some high level metrics to give you a better idea of the diversification of MAIN’s business.\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n Main Street Is Attractive For Multiple Reasons Aside from the growing dividend and significant historical share price appreciation, Main Street has a variety of attractive qualities, as described below. \\n\\n Growing Net Asset Value (“NAV”) As shown in the chart above, MAIN’s NAV per share has been growing, and this is a good thing for investors. It means the company has been growing its book of business, and it also means they’ve not been particularly dilutive to shareholders as they’ve been growing (this also is a good thing). Growing Distributable Net Investment Income (“DNII”) MAIN’s growing distributable net investment income also is a good thing. It means MAIN’s investments are spitting out more income that can be distributed to investors in the form of dividends. Note DNII is higher than the dividend, another good sign in terms of dividend cushion, safety and growth. Low Debt to Equity (Safety and& Buying Power) MAIN’s lower debt to equity, relative to peers, as shown in the following graphic, means the company has more dry powder to survive distress and potentially even be a buyer when distress hits (i.e. they could have the luxury of being able to invest at “fire sale” prices when other s are being forced to sell at low prices).\\n \\n\\n Strong Internal Management In addition to being well run, MAIN is internally managed, unlike most of its peers, which are externally managed. The internal management team helps align investor interests with management, and it helps keep management fees lower and more reasonable. For perspective, inside management also invests in MAIN, as shown in the following table, which is another good sign. \\n\\n Improving Analyst Estimates For more perspective, and for what it\\'s worth, the Wall Street analysts covering Main have been increasing their price targets, and they are recommending “hold” or “buy,” as shown below. \\n\\n Big Risks: In addition to the attractive qualities of MAIN, it\\'s important for investors to NOT fall in love with the security and to instead consider the big risk factors too. We have highlighted a variety of big risks below that investors may want to consider. Price-to-Book Value MAIN has a very high valuation, as measured by its price-to-book value, especially relative to its peers. For example, this next chart shows that MAIN’s price-to-book is significantly higher than other large BDC peers.\\n \\n\\n A couple important things to keep in mind. First, MAIN is considered by many to be a higher quality BDC relative to peers, and for these reasons it deserves a higher valuation. In our view, there\\'s some merit to this argument, based on its attractive qualities as described earlier. For more perspective, this next chart shows the price-to-book values of a universe of BDCs compared to each other and compared to their own historical ranges. \\n\\n While MAIN is more expensive than peers on a price-to-book basis, it’s still near only the middle of its own historical range. Yield Chasers We’d be remiss not to mention the dangers of high-yield chasing, particularly with regards to the BDC industry. Many investors understandably hate market volatility, and thereby prefer the comfort of owning steady big dividend payers to help them sleep well at night. To an extent this is true, but when yields get too high that’s often a sign of distress. For example, if you look under the hood of BDCs, they almost all own mostly high-yield debt. Specifically, they own debt that effectively falls into the “junk” bond category or worse. These are the loans that are too risky for regular banks to own. Now MAIN’s yield is lower than the yield of many BDC peers (see chart above), and that’s a tribute to its conservative (for a BDC) management. But let’s not forget, the industry often sells off very sharply all at once regardless of company specifics, and that\\'s a big risk for MAIN. It’s important for investors to not concentrate all their investments in one sector or asset class (such as high-yield BDCs). And for more perspective on our views about the dangers of “yield chasing” check out our article: The 7 Deadly Sins of Long-Term Investing.\\n Energy Sector Exposure Near the start of this article, we provided graphics showing MAIN’s diversification across sub-industries and geographies. And one risk factor, in particular, to keep on your radar, is the energy sector. MAIN announced earnings about a week ago, but that only included data through Sept. 30, right before energy prices started their steep declines. For example, the following chart shows MAIN shares performed well following the earning announcement, but that only included data through the end of third quarter — right before energy prices began to sell off. \\n\\n While only around 10% of MAIN’s sub-investments are in energy equipment (7%) and oil and gas (3%), 27% of the business is located in Texas and the surrounding areas, a region where the economy has an outsized dependence on the energy industry. Recall also MAIN is based in Houston, Texas. This is a risk factor to keep on your radar as it could add to negative volatility in the coming months, particularly if energy prices remain lower. Also worth mentioning, credit spreads (as we’ll cover in a moment) have a significant correlation with energy prices, and since BDCs are essentially high-yield credit vehicles, an energy sell-off could have a pronounced negative impact on MAIN. Credit Spreads MAIN regularly cites its investment grade credit rating, but if you look at the underlying investments, as we mentioned previously, they are not investment grade — they are essentially “junk.” Here\\'s a look at the historical performance of a BDC index (BDCS) vs. a junk bond index (HYG), and as you can see, BDCs track junk bonds very closely, and not the broader equity market as measured by the S&P 500 (SPY). \\n\\n\\n For more perspective, here\\'s a look at the historical performance of some of the bigger BDC’s vs. credit spreads for low-quality debt. \\n\\n When credit spreads rise (i.e. when investors get nervous about economic strength), BDCs sell off. Importantly, credit spreads currently remain very low by historical standards, but considering the recent bout of market choppiness over the last month, credit spreads could “blow out,” thereby having a very negative impact on BDCs, including MAIN. In our view, if credit spreads widen significantly, that\\'s the biggest risk factor for MAIN considering they own (like most BDCs) mainly very low-quality loans which are most sensitive to economic weakness. For perspective, per the recent quarterly earnings call, MAIN has only five of its many investments in “non-accrual” status: “…we had five investments on non-accrual status, which comprised approximately 1.2% of our total investment portfolio at fair valued, and 3.5% at cost.”: If credit spreads widen, this could quickly turn into a much larger number, and this is a big risk that investors should be aware of, in our view. Conclusion: In the BDC world, MAIN is high quality (relative to peers), it offers a conservative dividend, it uses a conservative amount of leverage (therefore they could actually be fire sale buyers not forced sellers during times of distress — a good thing), and it has much more financial strength than many of its peers. And arguably, its high valuation (price to book) is warranted. As the risk factors described in this article have intensified in recent weeks, Main Street has sold off, and the shares have become increasingly attractive. We recognize that the risks could intensify further, and the shares could continue to slide. However, on a risk vs. reward basis, we believe Main Street is attractive, and we\\'ve ranked it No. 10 in our recent article titled \"The More It Falls: Top 10 Big Yields Worth Considering,\" because of its attractive qualities. Remember, however, that BDC\\'s such as Main Street are not without risk, and for that reason it\\'s important to prudently diversify your portfolio across a variety of investment categories to keep your aggregate risks lower and your chances for success higher.\\n\\nDisclosure: I am/we are long MAIN.

It already started manufacturing its first electric car, the eTron. It goes on sale in Europe in early Q1 2019 and in the U.S. in early Q2 2019. Audi also has stated that it will launch 12 all-electric cars by 2025: The e-tron as starting signal: Audi launches e-offensive. The purpose of this article is to discuss what I know about these twelve cars. It turns out I know more about the first seven of them. As to the remaining five, I will offer a set of reasonable assumptions based on less information. Let’s start from the beginning, with what will be in dealerships imminently. eTron: Early 2019 The Audi eTron started manufacturing in Brussels in September 2018 and was supposed to start deliveries in Europe by December 2018. It got delayed approximately a month because of a change in software, which under European government rules requires a recertification of the vehicle. This recertification has since been completed, and we expect the car to start deliveries in Europe in January 2019. I drove this all-electric SUV, and the experience is mostly one of lacking any drama. If you had not told me that there was a battery-electric powertrain underneath, the experience is so relatively similar to any equivalent Audi premium SUV such as the Q8 that you could pretty much flip a coin.\\n In the U.S., the $75,795 price (net of the $7,500 Federal tax credit) also is within $100 of the price of the Q8, which is Audi’s gasoline-equivalent SUV. It’s up to you whether you prefer the range and refueling time of the gasoline car as opposed to the electric one. In terms of the exterior design, the eTron clearly looks better than the Q8, for whatever that’s worth. The eTron is Audi’s SUV stunner when it comes to exterior design. eTron Sportback: Late 2019 The Sportback is the same car as the eTron under the skin. What differs is the less practical “top hat” which is similar to what the BMW X6 is to the BMW X5. I have absolutely no understanding why anyone would prefer the less roomy “top hat” - but hey, this is why people’s tastes and preferences are apparently different from each other. It’s a styling thing. It will be made in the same Brussels factory as the regular eTron. Production is said to start by the end of Q3 2019 and be in dealerships by the end of Q4. I don’t expect it to sell as well as the “regular” eTron, but it will expand the addressable market for this platform. eTron GT: Early 2021 The Audi eTron GT concept was shown in November 2018 and it's basically the Porsche Taycan with a different body and interior. All the major “hard points” should be the same as the Taycan, so for all practical considerations, it’s the “same car.” The Porsche starts manufacturing in Q3 2019, but the Audi not until Q4 2020. It will be in dealerships in Q1 2021. The concept version looks like this: Audi Newsroom. The final version is going to see only tiny changes from this concept. Basically, one size smaller wheels, plus proper door handles - that’s it. Big and expensive vs. smaller and closer to $35,000 While the initial three Audi models listed above are “expensive” (starting at or above $75,000) and will be sold in the U.S., Audi also will bring to market less expensive EVs that may start around as little as $35,000. Some of these may be sold in the U.S., but several will not, as they are dedicated models for Europe and/or Asia (China, really).\\n Specifically, we are talking about Volkswagen’s MEB platform. Unlike the more expensive Audis, that will charge at either 150 kW or 270 kW (or even more), this less expensive platform will charge at 125 kW. The VW Group has laid out a launch plan that consists of 27 of these MEB cars by the end of 2022. They include models from Volkswagen, Audi, SEAT and Skoda. The first one will be the initial VW model for which manufacturing begins in November 2019. However, among the other 26 models between 2020 and 2022, there also will be four Audi models. The first two will be for Europe and the second two will be for China. The European models will likely be manufactured in Zwickau, Germany. The two Chinese models will likely be made in China. These four European and Chinese MEB-based Audis will likely be launched in 2021 - spread from early 2021 to late 2021, plus or minus a handful of months. What about the other five all-electric Audis? If you counted correctly, you will see that there are seven Audis listed above - on three separate platforms: MLB-Evo (eTron and eTron Sportback), J1 (eTron GT) and the other four on the MEB platform. Subtracting from the 12 models that Audi has approved and signed off upon, that leaves us with five more, about whom we have heard substantially nothing, except two things:  Audi will develop its future high-end cars not on the J1 platform but rather on the PPE platform, which it is a joint development with Porsche. Whether this will arrive in time to be part of this first batch of 12 models is not known, but if they started this development by 2016 or even 2017, it seems reasonable that it will be in production by 2022. Audi has said that it will “fill in” the remaining segments it looks to serve. This primarily means body size/style segments.  Two of those five models seem obvious: The U.S. needs an SUV that's larger than the eTron, and has three rows of seats that can fit at least seven people, perhaps eight. This would be similar to a Volkswagen Atlas in size, which is larger than the Audi Q7. I'm guessing this will arrive no later than 2022, with a smaller possibility for late 2021.\\n The second model that the U.S. needs is a more inexpensive SUV than the eTron. It need not be all that much smaller, but it may dictate that it be built on the MEB platform. It looks like we should expect this not before 2023, however. Will the U.S. need an electric sedan, other than the eTron GT, which is likely going to cost somewhere north of $75,000 - perhaps closer to $85,000 or even $90,000? Perhaps. One could make a case for one that has more interior space and cost perhaps below $50,000. However, it's not clear whether one such model is in Audi’s U.S. plan. I think it is, as a model of that kind is also needed for Europe and Asia, so it makes sense to make one of those to straddle the A4-A6 segment and sell it worldwide. Bottom Line: We now know more about these 12 Audl all-electric cars Audi is best known for its exceptional build quality and great design. The eTron all-electric SUV that I recently drove was top-notch in essentially every aspect, except its range, which seems to be barely above 200 miles. Audi’s products are tested for all climates. The doors open and close every time with precision. The interiors are as stylish as they are ergonomical. It’s small wonder that Audi has had such success, especially in the last half decade. Remember when Audi used to be just about “nothing” - even as little as a decade or two ago, let alone three or four? All of that is strong foundation for the brand to also do well with its first 12 all-electric cars. Audi’s Challenge: Same as all the other automakers The problem with electric cars is economical. Consumers are not asking for them at an unsubsidized price. Without mandates, subsidies or other incentives, adoption rates are around 0.1%, whether you are looking at Russia, Africa, Southern Europe, Middle East, most of Asia, Latin America or for that matter a majority of the U.S. land mass. EVs sell at rates far higher than 0.1% only in areas with mandates, subsidies or other significant incentives: China, California, the other U.S. ZEV states, Norway, and some other limited European geographies. Everywhere else, it’s pretty much a zero. Been in North Dakota or Turkey recently?\\n The problem comes when no more than 0.1% of the population are asking for the product at the unsubsidized price, but the government says you have to sell 10% or even more of your output in the form of EVs. Almost per definition, you will have to sell these cars at loss. Audi and its numerous competitors will bring out literally close to 200 such models by 2022. Will there be demand to buy all or most of these 200 EVs in volumes and at prices that make them profitable? Well, if that demand would be there, we wouldn’t need mandates, subsidies and other government incentives, would we? The challenge for Audi and all the other automakers will be to survive these government-mandated losses. It does not bode well for any automaker.\\nGet More Mileage Out Of Your Auto Investing\\nThe auto industry moves fast, and it can be tough to stay on top of everything that's happening.

It is among the cheapest in its peer group on an EV/NPV basis.The catalysts for this return will be the low decline base Cardium production, strong technical team, inventory of Cardium development locations, and exploratory potential in the East Duvernay region.'], 'article': ['Company Background \\n\\n InPlay Oil Corp. (OTCQX:IPOOF) is a crude oil exploration, development and production company with centralized operations in Alberta. The company’s current focus is on the cardium at Pembina, Willis Green and the emerging East Basin Duvernay plays. InPlay Oil’s goal is to generate profitable per share growth in production, reserves and funds flow by building a large, low decline light oil focused asset base. This is to be achieved by acquiring low decline and high operating netback producing properties with development potential, and enhanced oil recovery potential as well as undeveloped lands with exploration and development potential. Private InPlay was incorporated November 12, 2012 and commenced operations June 2013. Operations were mainly on the exploration and development of prospects in the greater Pembina and East Central Alberta. On November 7, 2016 a merger involving private InPlay and Anderson Energy Inc. (a publicly traded company) was completed via reverse takeover. The combined entity is now called InPlay Oil Corp, which has the same directors and management as private InPlay. As of November 10, 2016 InPlay’s common shares began trading on the TSX under the symbol “IPO” in substitution of the Anderson common shares.\\n Management of IPO has a track record of providing production, cash flow and reserve growth on a per share basis from their time at Vervo Energy. CEO Douglas Bartole has surrounded himself with a technically oriented team focused on adapting to the most proven and up to date technology and drilling techniques. The board is mostly independent and includes 2 members from JOG Capital Inc., who are significant shareholders of IPO through when the company was private. Management and the board collectively own over 45% of shares outstanding, meaning strong alignment of board and shareholder interests. Production as of today is roughly 4,600 boe/d with the oil and liquids weighting at ~72%. About 91% of current production is from the Cardium formation at Pembina and Willis Green. The remainder of production comes from the Belly River and Manville formations. IPO’s base PDP production features a low decline rate of 22%. \\n\\n Source: 2018 Q2 Investor Presentation While there is little production coming from the East Basin Duvernay acreage at this time (65 boe/d), the area represents a major potential catalyst. IPO has 16.25 net sections in the play and unlike the other plays it is much more practical for a company of IPO’s size based on the fact that it is shallower and has a higher light oil weighting (internal estimate of 12-20 mmbbl original oil in place per section). $1 billion has been raised in the last 18 months to develop East Basin Duvernay. IPO boasts an inventory of Cardium development locations that will be utilized to organically grow production by 10-15% per year, while they work to determine the potential of Duvernay. Land Base Overview \\n\\n\\n Source: 2018 Q2 Investor Presentation Bioturbated Cardium: We begin our discussion on IPO’s assets with a quick outline of the bioturbated cardium as this is the main driver of the resurgence that we have seen in the play over the past few years. The bioturbated cardium is situated between the upper and lower portion of the reservoir, and is characterized as having lower porosity than the upper portion, but still with large resources in place. The bioturbated cardium has traditionally not been targeted as technology has not been up to the task of dealing with the lower porosity. With the step changes in completions operators in the Cardium, there is now the ability to exploit these previously unrecoverable reserves situated in the lower, tighter portion of the reservoir. With the old drill path, operators in the Willesden Green area were believed to only be coming into contact with the top 2-4 metres of the reservoir. With the new deeper drill path, and a more intense completion operation, single wells are now coming in contact with a larger portion of the Cardium reservoir (7-14 metres) with each drill. In terms of resource in place, the upper portion of the Cardium in the Willesden Green area is mapped to have ~8.0 MMboe per section, while the lower portion including the bioturbated has ~6.0 MMboe per section. As a result, the new well trajectory and completion technique is believed to be coming in contact with significantly more of the resource (~14.0 MMboe), which is ultimately expected to translate into higher recoveries over time. Greater Pembina: This field is located approximately 75 km’s to the southeast of Edmonton, Alberta, and is one of the largest conventional discoveries in Canada with ~9.4 billion barrels of OOIP, and since the pool was first drilled in 1953 less than 20% has been recovered. The pool is beginning to see a resurgence with the application of horizontal drilling. IPO currently holds a land position of 54,724 (40,108 net) acres. The company has an ownership in area facilities allowing for control of production. In total IPO has an interest in five major oil facilities with water treating and disposal capacity, two batteries tied directly into the Pembina sales line, and firm takeaway of more than 80% of their natural gas volumes. Approximately 60% of IPO’s production in the area is under long term water flood resulting in a base decline in the area of sub 10%. IPO’s average replacement ratio is ~1.0, meaning they are maintaining reservoir pressure which is key to maintaining production levels and achieving recovery rates.\\n Production is currently at 1,500 boe/d (77% liquids), 960 boe/d from the Cardium and 540 from the Belly River. This is down from 2,300 boe/d one year ago. \\n\\n Source: 2018 Q2 Investor Presentation Given the recent results and type curve economics, I expect IPO to focus more on the Willesden Green Cardium versus the greater Pembina area. Willesden Green Cardium: Willesden Green is located just south of Pembina (about 80km north of Red Deer, AB). The Cardium of this region has obtained increased attention as a result of strong rates achieved via horizontals with increased frac intensity in the bioturbated portion of the reservoir. IPO currently has 43,040 acres in the region and produces ~2,700 boe/d, up from ~1,500 only one year ago as the region has an overall liquids weighting of 70%. With a focus on oil rich portions of the reservoir, the liquids weighting should increase going forward. In fact towards the later half of 2017 IPO reallocated capital towards the Willesden Green region. As we can see below the type curve economics of this region are more desirable. \\n\\n \\n\\n Source: 2018 Q2 Investor Presentation\\n Economics in the area are enhanced by ownership in facility including a 10 mmcf/d gas plant which generates 3rd party processing revenue. IPO also has firm service for 100% of their natural gas volumes. East Basin Duvernay Shale: Drilling depths are deep in this region resulting in challenging economics relative to other plays. The lesser known portion known as the East Basin has become very oil prone due to a material ramp up in land scale metrics and improving well results. Although the play is in its infancy, it is a compelling prospect for the following reasons:  Its depth, the zone is much shallower at 2,150 meters versus the Kaybob area in the play at 3,300 meters below surface, resulting in drilling costs off a pad at half the amount (likely in the $5-6MM range). The product mix is weighted 80-90% towards light oil. With a strong infrastructure network in the area based on shallow gas activity combined with a light oil weighting, economics in the area are expected to be strong with operating netbacks of ~$40-$45/bbl at $50/bbl WTI.  It remains unclear as to how many wells will be required to develop the resource, but 4-5 wells per section would not be unreasonable, this would result in an inventory of 65-80 (one mile equivalent) locations. On a one mile equivalent IPO could drill a one off well for ~$5.5MM \\n\\n Source: 2018 Q2 Investor Presentation Focus Areas Production Breakdown and Reserves Bookings \\n\\n\\n Source: 2018 Q2 Investor Presentation Valuation The reserves data set forth below (the \"Reserves Data\") is based upon an evaluation by Sproule with an effective date of December 31, 2017 and is contained in the Sproule Report. The Reserves Data summarizes the crude oil, natural gas liquids and natural gas reserves of InPlay Oil and the net present values of future net revenue for these reserves using forecast prices and costs prior to the provision for interest, debt service charges, general and administrative expenses, the impact of hedging activities, and after deduction of royalties, operating costs, certain estimated well abandonment and reclamation costs and estimated future capital expenditures. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n Source: 2017 Annual Information Form The 10% discount rate is most appropriate since it is the closest to market returns that the Sproule report does.

Conclusion Even if commodity prices increase at very moderate levels over the next 7 years, IPO yields a NAV of $3.80 which is 4.6x its current price at $0.83/share. The reason for this high projected return is the low decline base Cardium production, strong technical team, inventory of Cardium development locations, and exploratory potential in the East Duvernay light oil play. The main risk in buying this stock is time horizon risk since as long as fears about the stability of oil prices persist, there is no telling how soon this return can be realized. Other risks include increases on royalties payable to the Alberta and federal governments of Canada and continued pipeline capacity bottlenecks in Canada.\\n\\nDisclosure: I/we have no positions in any stocks mentioned, but may initiate a long position in IPOOF over the next 72 hours.

Click here to find out more » I recently bought some Visa (NYSE:V) for my portfolio with the market dip. Visa has had a tremendous run starting the year at $114.57 and rising up to $151.56 on October 1, 2018. This represents a 32.29% increase during the year. Additionally, Visa began the year paying a dividend of $0.21 per share per quarter, which has been increased to $0.25 per share per quarter. Last year, Visa rose from $78.76 in January to $114.02 at the end of the year. This represented a 44.77% increase in value. I believe that Visa is poised for continuous growth and outperformance as more customers migrate to mobile payments and financial technology. Visa is a strong company with historically no debt (until recently). Visa also has a large cash piled up in their balance sheet. Given this information, Visa is a great long term buy-and-hold stock for both capital appreciation and dividend income. Visa Share Price Visa's share price has been growing steadily over the last 5 years, rising from the a price of $70 per share up to a high of $150 per share. Visa was able to double its market value while simultaneously raise dividend payouts to their shareholders. This shows how Visa is a company who's very strong, financially. Much of this growth is attributed to the expansion of Visa's global financial services and adoption of mobile payment solutions. In 2018, Visa completed their Europe technology migration that brought new clients into their Visa network. Below is a technical chart of Visa's share price over the last few years.\\n \\n\\n Source: Tradingview.com Comparing Visa against the S&P 500, Visa has outperformed realizing a CAGR of 25.89% versus the S&P's 13.97%. Visa also has higher risk adjusted returns as measured by its 1.52 Sharpe ratio compared to S&P's 1.32. If you had invested $10,000 in Visa in 2013, you'd have $39,053 instead of $21,681 in the market, as shown in Portfolio Visualizer's Back-testing program below: \\n\\n Constructed using PortfolioVisualizer. Portfolio 1 Represents a 100% investment in Visa. On Christmas Eve, the S&P 500 closed at 2,351.10, which represented a 12.39% drop from its opening price level 2,683.73 on January 2nd.

They've steadily increased their dividend payout which ranges from $0.0526 per share to $0.88 per share.   Period Total Dividends Paid Per Share % Change   2008 $0.0526    2009 $0.1102 109.51%   2010 $0.1314 19.24%   2011 $0.1675 27.47%   2012 $0.2475 47.76%   2013 $0.3475 40.40%   2014 $0.4200 20.86%   2015 $0.5000 19.05%   2016 $0.5900 18.00%   2017 $0.7050 19.49%   2018 $0.8800 24.82%    Average 34.66%    Trailing 5-Year Average 20.45%   Source: Visa Inc. - Stock Information - Dividends These dividend increased a total of 1,573% over the past 10 years, an average of 34.66% per year. During the same time period, Visa's stock price went from an adjusted $14.50 per share in August 2008 to $124.26 when it closed today. Additionally, Visa had a 4-1 stock split on March 18, 2015. If we measure Visa's share price alone, the shares gave us a total return of 756.97%.\\n Visa Valuation Metrics To evaluate Visa's company in relation to the rest of the industry, we take a look at its financial ratios. According to Morningstar, Visa's Price/Earnings and Price/Cash Flow ratios are both below its 5-Year average signaling a potential undervalued opportunity. A low Price/Earnings and Price/Cash Flow implies that its earnings and free cash flow are too high in proportion to its stock price. Since the earnings and cash flow in the denominator is larger, the overall ratio gets smaller. \\n\\n Visa's income statement shows strong revenue growth over the last 5 years. Visa averaged an increase in sales of 12.98% per year. \\n\\n Source: Visa 10-K After accounting for expenses, it's operating income has also been increasing over the last 5 years on an average of 13.79% per year.    2014 2015 2016 2017 2018   Sales 12702 13880 15082 18358 20609   % Growth  9.27% 8.66% 21.72% 12.26%   Average Growth % 12.98%       Operating Income 10079 11617 12524 15392 16810   % Growth  15.26% 7.81% 22.90% 9.21%   Average Growth % 13.79%       As a result of increased sales and operating income, Visa's net income has risen over the last 5 years on an average of 18.30% per year. Its most recent year saw an explosive growth of 53.73% in net income. Given that sales only grew 12.26% in the same year, we can attribute this number to a change in expenses and US tax laws.   Net Income 5421 6313 5929 6467 9942   % Growth  16.45% -6.08% 9.07% 53.73%   Average Growth % 18.30%       Tax Laws Digging into Visa's annual report, we found that the effective tax rate for Fiscal 2018 was only 20%. This was a huge drop compared to Fiscal 2017 when the tax rate was 43%. This explained why net income had risen so much in one year. This change in tax rate was a result of a few factors:  The effects of the Tax Act on December 22, 2017 lowered the statutory corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%. Because of this, Visa remeasured their net deferred tax liabilities and resulted in a one-time tax benefit of $1.1 billion. Additionally, Visa received in additional $161 million in tax benefits due to non-recurring audit settlements Visa benefited from a $1.5 billion non-recurring, non-cash income tax provision due to the elimination of a deferred tax balance after Visa integrated into Europe; and Visa received a $71 million one-time tax benefit from treasury stock given to Visa Foundation.  In terms of sales, Visa's volume of transactions against its peers was phenomenal. Visa far surpasses its next biggest rival, MasterCard, in four major areas including volume of payments, total volume in dollars, total transactions, and number of cards. \\n\\n Source: Visa Annual Report Debt In terms of debt, Visa did not carry any long term debt until 2016. In 2016 and 2017, Visa issued fixed-rate senior notes totaling $2.5 billion and $16 billion respectively. The proceeds were used to fund the acquisition of Visa Europe Limited. Its average interest expense was $534 million over the last 3 years. Given its most recent operating income of $16.810 billion, Visa has an interest coverage ratio of 31.48. This basically says that Visa can potentially have enough to cover the next 31 years worth of interest payments. Additionally, given its $8.1 billion balance of cash and cash equivalents, Visa is positioned to weather and major market storms in the near future.\\n \\n\\n Source: Visa Annual Report Conclusion Based on this information, Visa is in a great position to continue growing. As their Europe integration completes, we can expect them to gradually pay off their debt. Visa continues to expand globally and into mobile solutions. As mobile payment picks up, Visa is positioned conduct higher volumes of transactions. Visa currently has a low dividend yield, less than 1%, which is a result of a low payout ratio. This leaves room for large dividend growth in the future while still retaining cash for expansions. This current market dip gives us opportunities to open new positions in Visa or add to current positions as its getting closer to its 52-week low. As such, I believe now is a good time to enter a position in Visa with its current share price at $131. If the shares go below $130, that represents an even more opportunistic time to purchase shares. With the market down recently, there's great opportunity to snatch up some shares of Visa as we enter the new year. Visa is strong enough to withstand any economic downturns with their strong balance sheet and having a stable dividend company will provide income during a period of market instability.\\nDisclosure: I am/we are long V.

Another battle looms, but wars are not always won by battles.'], 'article': ['Friedman And RH Have Won The Battle, And The Prize, And Moved On. When RH (RH) CEO, Gary Friedman defeated the shorts in 2017, he achieved a major objective for himself and RH, which led to achieving other major objectives. The first objective achieved was a reduction in the share count by almost half. This, in turn, led to an immediate near doubling of EPS, which in turn led to an increase in share price. But earnings at the time were not that high. It was the subsequent delivery of a significant increase in earnings that drove the share price that much higher. In 2017, the shorts aided Friedman by keeping the share price down, while he bought up every share he could for RH. Short interest in RH is at high levels going into 2019. But don\\'t expect in 2019 to see a similar short squeeze to that engineered by Friedman in 2017. A similar result to 2017 would be unlikely because there are far fewer shares available to purchase, and almost all the float is held by 7 institutional investors. The reasons for shorting RH in 2019 are almost certainly far more complex than an opportunistic driving down of the share price for gain. Those complexities make it possibly wise for RH to stand back and let the various interests involved go about their business without interference from RH. Finally, RH is projected to again report strong growth in earnings for FY 2018, with ongoing growth in FY 2019. RH does not have any imperative to raise equity capital in the short term, so a low share price is not an immediate issue. Continued earnings growth can be expected to sustain higher share prices in the medium to longer term.\\n RH - Tugging At The Heart Strings \\n\\n Source: RH Baby and Child Homepage Reasons For Shorting RH In 2019 Are Far More Complex Than In 2017 Before addressing the complexities associated with shorting in FY 2019, let us look at the composition of the shareholdings in RH, per TABLEs 1 and 2 below. TABLE 1 \\n\\n TABLE 2 \\n\\n TABLE 1 analysis is from the DEF 14A filing with SEC by RH on June 4, 2018, showing shareholdings at May 24, 2018. TABLE 2 analysis tracks issued and outstanding shares from May 24, 2018, through November 3, 2018. TABLE 2 shows there are ~400,000 fewer shares issued and outstanding at November 3 compared to the 21,633,790 reported at May 24 per TABLE 1. For me, there is a bit of a mystery about the issue of 617,242 shares in Q2-2018 per TABLE 2 above. There is no mention in the 10-Q filed with the SEC. At share prices current in Q2, the market value of those shares would have been well over $70MM at the time, and for RH that is material. I have written to the company seeking clarification, and I await a reply. RH Short Interest And Activity TABLE 3 \\n\\n\\n Source: Yahoo Finance RH Key Statistics | RH Stock - Yahoo Finance Figure 1 \\n\\n Source: ShortVolumes.com TABLE 3 above shows RH had 6.83MM shares short interest at November 30, 2018. That is high compared to issued shares. It raises the question, who could be shorting RH? Who Could Be Interested In Shorting RH In 2018 and 2019? The seven institutional investors All of the seven institutional investors in TABLE 1 could be shorting RH shares as part of their normal investing strategy. Rather than selling shares when the share price was over $150 in the middle of 2018, they could have sold short knowing they had the shares to cover. The same would apply to individual investors holding RH shares if they wished to take this approach. Hedge Contracts Counterparty/Counterparties RH has entered into hedge contracts with third parties in relation to its convertible senior notes. These third parties are required to compensate RH to the extent the share price is in excess of the strike price at the point of conversion of the notes. By shorting to drive the share price below the strike price, these third parties not only avoid compensating RH at a higher share price but also stand to make a tidy profit from the shorting activity. Convertible Note Holders The convertible notes are zero coupon, so the only way for the noteholders to get a return on the notes is to convert to shares and sell at a profit. But sale at a profit is not guaranteed following conversion. With shares trading at over $150 in mid-2018, compared to a strike price of $116.09, it would be a no-brainer for note holders to sell short. On conversion, for every $1,000 of notes, holders receive 8.6143 shares making the strike price equivalent to $116.09 per share. If the share price was below $116.09 at date of maturity of the notes, they could choose not to convert, and receive cash equivalent to $116.09 per share with which to buy shares at the lower price to cover. If the price is above $116.09 at time of conversion, they can choose to convert, and either receive 8.6143 shares per $1,000 of notes, or cash equivalent to 8.6143 shares multiplied by the average share price during the conversion period, allowing them to cover without loss.\\n Parties Without RH Shares Borrowing Shares To Short RH This would seem like a very dangerous game to play. All the other parties discussed above have a fallback position in case the RH share price goes above the price at which they shorted. All the parties above are covered whether the share price goes up or down. Together, this relatively small group control most of the tradeable shares in RH. They will first cover their own positions. They will not be affected by a short-squeeze and are able to create a short-squeeze, just by withholding their shareholdings from sale. It is parties who do not own shares that are extremely vulnerable to a short attack by parties who will have a strong desire to see the share price go higher, once they have covered their own short positions. The Position Of RH In Relation To Shorting Of Its Shares In 2019 As discussed above, the parties most likely shorting RH shares now and into 2019 will likely be covered whether the share price goes up or down from here. It would be fairly pointless for RH to conduct a short-squeeze campaign against parties in that position. Besides, it would likely not be very smart for RH to needlessly attack its major shareholders and its hedge counterparty/counterparties. In the absence of a need to raise capital through an equity issue, a temporarily low RH share price over the next six months is likely not particularly concerning for RH. Notwithstanding that, RH has an approved share repurchase program in place. If its share price is forced down sufficiently by shorting, RH, led by Mr. Friedman, might be unable to resist undertaking further share repurchases. If that is the case, RH will need to be certain it has sufficient cash funding in place to repay its notes maturing on June 15, 2019. Cash To Repay $350MM 2019 Notes Is Of High Importance To RH Availability of cash to repay the $350MM 2019 notes maturing on June 15, 2019, is of high importance:  If the share price is below the strike price of the 2019 notes, shareholders will not apply to convert to shares, and cash will be required to repay the $350MM falling due. Failure to repay on time would constitute a default which in turn could trigger bankruptcy proceedings if not quickly remedied. RH has the right to settle conversion applications in shares, or equivalent cash, or a mix of cash and shares. RH will wish to minimize dilution from additional share issues by settling the whole amount, or as much as possible, in cash. \\n On December 4, 2018, RH announced:   it intends to explore a potential offering of $300 million aggregate principal amount of convertible notes due 2023 in a private offering to qualified institutional buyers.\"  On December 13, 2018, RH announced: it has elected to no longer explore the previously announced opportunistic $300 million convertible notes offering. RH\\'s current capital structure and internally-generated cash flow are more than sufficient to meet future obligations and long-term growth objectives. As such, the purpose of this financing was opportunistic and RH has determined that current market conditions are not conducive to an attractive convertible notes offering at this time.\" The abandonment of the capital raising should not be too concerning. From RH third quarter 2017 10-Q filing: For the nine months ended October 28, 2017, net cash used in financing activities was $553.0 million primarily due to $1.0 billion of share repurchases made under the $300 Million Repurchase Program and $700 Million Repurchase Program. Cash funding for the share repurchase programs was provided by available cash balances, net borrowings under the asset based credit facility of $341.0 million, as well as borrowings under the term loans of $180.0 million, borrowings under loans secured by certain equipment of $20.0 million and borrowings under a promissory note secured by our aircraft of $14.0 million. It may have been expensive, but RH was able to borrow $521MM towards share repurchases in 2017. On that basis, if needed, a borrowing of $350MM in 2019 to repay existing debt should be possible, particularly as RH earnings, and capacity to repay, are much stronger at present than in 2017. RH Fundamentals Will Supplant Financial Engineering In 2019 There are not the same imperatives for RH to defend and grow its share price, by means of share repurchases, as there were in 2017. The reasons for the current large short interest in RH may be mainly due to existing shareholders protecting their individual positions, rather than pure speculative action. If the share price sinks sufficiently low, RH might not be able to resist the temptation to repurchase additional shares. If funds are used for repurchases this will reduce funds available for the potential need to repay the $350MM of maturing notes wholly in cash. RH will need to carefully monitor cash flow from operations over the next several months, to know what, if any, new borrowing will be required to repay the 2019 notes, and whether that funding will be available when needed.\\n\\nFor my Analysts\\' Corner members, a link is provided to allow download of the 1View∞Scenarios™ dashboards to allow them to do their own scenario testing.

After being over $150 as recently as September, the share price closed at $108.46 on December 24.Shares were back up to $118.56 on December 27, only slightly above the $116.09 strike price for the $350MM of convertible senior notes maturing June 15, 2019.If the share price is below $116.09, note holders are unlikely to elect to convert, and cash payments totaling $350MM will be required.In 2017, the shorts were routed in a massive short squeeze battle, engineered by RH CEO, Gary Friedman. Another battle looms, but wars are not always won by battles.'], 'article': ['Friedman And RH Have Won The Battle, And The Prize, And Moved On. When RH (RH) CEO, Gary Friedman defeated the shorts in 2017, he achieved a major objective for himself and RH, which led to achieving other major objectives. The first objective achieved was a reduction in the share count by almost half. This, in turn, led to an immediate near doubling of EPS, which in turn led to an increase in share price. But earnings at the time were not that high. It was the subsequent delivery of a significant increase in earnings that drove the share price that much higher. In 2017, the shorts aided Friedman by keeping the share price down, while he bought up every share he could for RH. Short interest in RH is at high levels going into 2019. But don\\'t expect in 2019 to see a similar short squeeze to that engineered by Friedman in 2017. A similar result to 2017 would be unlikely because there are far fewer shares available to purchase, and almost all the float is held by 7 institutional investors. The reasons for shorting RH in 2019 are almost certainly far more complex than an opportunistic driving down of the share price for gain. Those complexities make it possibly wise for RH to stand back and let the various interests involved go about their business without interference from RH. Finally, RH is projected to again report strong growth in earnings for FY 2018, with ongoing growth in FY 2019. RH does not have any imperative to raise equity capital in the short term, so a low share price is not an immediate issue. Continued earnings growth can be expected to sustain higher share prices in the medium to longer term.\\n RH - Tugging At The Heart Strings \\n\\n Source: RH Baby and Child Homepage Reasons For Shorting RH In 2019 Are Far More Complex Than In 2017 Before addressing the complexities associated with shorting in FY 2019, let us look at the composition of the shareholdings in RH, per TABLEs 1 and 2 below. TABLE 1 \\n\\n TABLE 2 \\n\\n TABLE 1 analysis is from the DEF 14A filing with SEC by RH on June 4, 2018, showing shareholdings at May 24, 2018. TABLE 2 analysis tracks issued and outstanding shares from May 24, 2018, through November 3, 2018. TABLE 2 shows there are ~400,000 fewer shares issued and outstanding at November 3 compared to the 21,633,790 reported at May 24 per TABLE 1. For me, there is a bit of a mystery about the issue of 617,242 shares in Q2-2018 per TABLE 2 above. There is no mention in the 10-Q filed with the SEC. At share prices current in Q2, the market value of those shares would have been well over $70MM at the time, and for RH that is material. I have written to the company seeking clarification, and I await a reply. RH Short Interest And Activity TABLE 3 \\n\\n\\n Source: Yahoo Finance RH Key Statistics | RH Stock - Yahoo Finance Figure 1 \\n\\n Source: ShortVolumes.com TABLE 3 above shows RH had 6.83MM shares short interest at November 30, 2018. That is high compared to issued shares. It raises the question, who could be shorting RH? Who Could Be Interested In Shorting RH In 2018 and 2019? The seven institutional investors All of the seven institutional investors in TABLE 1 could be shorting RH shares as part of their normal investing strategy. Rather than selling shares when the share price was over $150 in the middle of 2018, they could have sold short knowing they had the shares to cover. The same would apply to individual investors holding RH shares if they wished to take this approach. Hedge Contracts Counterparty/Counterparties RH has entered into hedge contracts with third parties in relation to its convertible senior notes. These third parties are required to compensate RH to the extent the share price is in excess of the strike price at the point of conversion of the notes. By shorting to drive the share price below the strike price, these third parties not only avoid compensating RH at a higher share price but also stand to make a tidy profit from the shorting activity. Convertible Note Holders The convertible notes are zero coupon, so the only way for the noteholders to get a return on the notes is to convert to shares and sell at a profit. But sale at a profit is not guaranteed following conversion. With shares trading at over $150 in mid-2018, compared to a strike price of $116.09, it would be a no-brainer for note holders to sell short. On conversion, for every $1,000 of notes, holders receive 8.6143 shares making the strike price equivalent to $116.09 per share. If the share price was below $116.09 at date of maturity of the notes, they could choose not to convert, and receive cash equivalent to $116.09 per share with which to buy shares at the lower price to cover. If the price is above $116.09 at time of conversion, they can choose to convert, and either receive 8.6143 shares per $1,000 of notes, or cash equivalent to 8.6143 shares multiplied by the average share price during the conversion period, allowing them to cover without loss.\\n Parties Without RH Shares Borrowing Shares To Short RH This would seem like a very dangerous game to play. All the other parties discussed above have a fallback position in case the RH share price goes above the price at which they shorted. All the parties above are covered whether the share price goes up or down. Together, this relatively small group control most of the tradeable shares in RH. They will first cover their own positions. They will not be affected by a short-squeeze and are able to create a short-squeeze, just by withholding their shareholdings from sale. It is parties who do not own shares that are extremely vulnerable to a short attack by parties who will have a strong desire to see the share price go higher, once they have covered their own short positions. The Position Of RH In Relation To Shorting Of Its Shares In 2019 As discussed above, the parties most likely shorting RH shares now and into 2019 will likely be covered whether the share price goes up or down from here.

More than a few traders and investors experienced a very uncomfortable Christmas Eve this year when stocks and the price of oil plunged to their lowest level of the year on Monday, December 24 in a holiday-shortened trading session. While cooler heads prevailed the day after the holiday and both stocks and oil posted significant gains, markets could be sending a signal about the coming year with recent price volatility. It is unlikely that we will see a repeat performance of the worst Christmas Eve in the equity and crude oil markets in history on New Year’s Eve. However, with only one shortened trading session left in 2018, we could see lots of fireworks in the New Year when markets open for trading on Wednesday, January 2. So many issues face markets over the coming year all of which have the potential to provide sessions like the one on Christmas Eve. I will be fastening my seatbelts and looking to buy volatility on dips over the coming days and weeks as price variance could be even more of the norm in 2019 than it was over the final three months of 2018 in markets. When it comes to stocks, I have had success trading the iPath S&P 500 VIX Short-Term Futures ETN product (VXX) and will continue to look to buy on dips. VXX is a very short-term product that suffers from time decay, but it is highly liquid and tends to magnify the performance of the stock market during periods of price declines as it acts like a put option on stocks; the price of VXX moves higher when the stock market is moving lower as we witnessed on Christmas Eve. In the world of commodities, I am going into 2019 cautiously. However, the recent price action in the gold and silver markets has been impressive with gold making higher lows and higher highs since mid-August despite a strong dollar and silver breaking above the $15 level this week in a sign of strength. I like the Aberdeen Standard Physical Precious Metals Basket ETF product (GLTR) which holds physical gold, silver, palladium, and platinum. The fund summary states:\\n “The investment objective of the Trust is for the Shares to reflect the performance of the price of physical gold, silver, platinum and palladium in the proportions held by the Trust, less the expenses of the Trusts operations. The Shares are designed for investors who want a cost-effective and convenient way to invest in a basket of Bullion with minimal credit risk.” GLTR has been moving to the upside since mid-August as capital has flowed into the precious metals as a hedge against the wild volatility and uncertainty we face over the coming weeks and months. \\n\\n Source: Barchart As the chart shows, GLTR moved from a low at $56.32 per share in mid-August to $62.78 as of Friday, December 28, an increase of 11.5%. In an environment where the prices of most assets have declined substantially, GLTR has done very well, and I expect that to continue into 2019.

Therefore, we remain focused on the potential \"Long\" candidates which could be a good weekly trades or part of your portfolio for a longer period of time. The fund which I am going to review today is Nuveen Municipal High Income Opportunity Fund (NMZ). Over the past five years, NMZ had one of the highest returns on net asset value. The annualized return on NAV for that period is 7.86%. Additionally, we do have the statistical edge in the face of the Z-score of -2.70 points. The spread between the price and the net asset value is 11.97% which is relatively high to meet my requirements. \\n\\n\\n Source: CEFConnect.com  As usual, let us gather more information about the investment policy of the fund: The Fund\\'s primary investment objective is to provide high current income exempt from regular federal income tax. Its secondary investment objective is to seek attractive total return consistent with its primary objective. The fund invests in municipal securities that are exempt from federal income taxes; the fund uses leverage. By investment policy, up to 75% of its managed assets may be invested in municipal securities rated, at the time of investment, Baa/BBB or lower by at least one nationally recognized statistical rating organization (S&P, Moody\\'s, and Fitch) including below-investment grade securities, or unrated securities judged by the manager to be of comparable quality. No more than 10% of the fund\\'s managed assets may be invested in municipal securities rated below B3/B-, or that are unrated but judged by the manager to be of comparable quality. Over the past week, the price of the fund fell by 3.14%, but the net asset value rose by 0.62%. On the chart below, you can see the widened spread between the two metrics. \\n\\n Source: CEFConnect.com \\n\\nNMZ data by YCharts The current dividend is $0.0565 per common share, and it\\'s paid on a monthly basis. The current yield on net asset value is 5.24%, and the current yield on price is 5.95%. \\n\\n\\n Source: Fund Sponsor Website The below chart aims to show us where NMZ in the universe of national Munis. No doubt, its place proves that we have a very good combination of discount and return on net asset value. \\n\\n Source: VIX Central Earning coverage ratio is another characteristic which most of the investors observe and include in their analysis. In our case, we do have an earning of $0.0602 per share. High enough to cover the distribution rate of $0.0565. \\n\\n Source: Fund Sponsor Website From the rated assets, the investments with a rating of \"BBB\" take 19.80% of the portfolio. Here, the biggest concern is the part with \"Non-rated\" assets. I admit it can be a bit worrying, but until its net asset value remains stable, we can review this fund a good opportunity for a short-term trade and maybe not so much for a long-term investment for some very conservative portfolio. \\n\\n Source: Fund Sponsor Website The assets in the portfolio from issuers located in Illinois are 13.80%, and the ones located in California are 13.40%. \"Tax Obligation/Limited\" and \"Health Care\" are the sectors with the biggest weights.\\n \\n\\n Source: Fund Sponsor Website Here, we are talking about a significant deviation of four standard deviations between the price of the benchmark and the price of Nuveen Municipal High Income Opportunity Fund. As you see on the chart below, the current spread is very widened. \\n\\n Source: Author\\'s software \\n\\n Source: Author\\'s software Conclusion Municipal bond closed-end funds seem beaten up, shaken by dividend cuts - which are a healthy necessity most of the time - and full (or perhaps not as much by now) of investors who are scared of the rising interest rate environment. There is good reason to consider restructuring your portfolio in accordance with the bigger picture. However, in our view, the selling might have gone too far, and there are candidates from this sector for a mean reversion trade at the very least. Based on the data that I have reviewed, NMZ can be a potential \"Long\" addition to your portfolio. Note: This article was originally published on December 23, 2018, and as such, some figures and charts might not be entirely up to date.\\nTrade With Beta\\nAt Trade With Beta we also pay close attention to closed-end funds and are always keeping an eye on them for directional and arbitrage opportunities created by market price deviations. As you can guess, timing is crucial in these kinds of trades; therefore, you are welcome to join us for early access and the discussions accompanying these kinds of trades\\nDisclosure: I/we have no positions in any stocks mentioned, but may initiate a long position in NMZ over the next 72 hours. I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions. I am not receiving compensation for it (other than from Seeking Alpha). I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article.']}\n",

When we think of risk, we tend to think of it based on the type of financial instrument (cash, bond, equity, etc.), but it is important to remember that the risk continues to break down from there because not all bonds or equities are created equal. Generally speaking, the image below offers a generic view of the risk/reward that tends to follow some of the investment options we have the option of using. \\n\\n Source: XTB - Risk vs Return of Investment Types A well-rounded portfolio should have elements of these types of investments like certificates of deposit, bonds, and equities. It is within each of these groups that we can begin to truly assess the risk a specific investment on the portfolio. So, how do we decide how much risk we are willing to accept? This is a difficult question to answer because what might represent a risk to you may not represent a risk to me. Instead of answering this question, I think there is a better question for investors to ask when approaching the construction of their portfolio: What can I do to maintain reasonable returns while at the same time reduce the risk of downside in my investment portfolio?\\n After years of investing and making mistakes, this question is what ultimately compelled me to become a Dividend Growth Investor or a DGI (I will also refer to this as DG). The goal of this article is to explore the idea of being a DGI and why it is an effective method for overcoming risk. I want to also offer readers\\' some easy solutions that will help them assess the risk in their portfolio and what they can do to combat it. Why I Chose Dividend Growth Investing There are many reasons for being a DGI and everyone who subscribes to the model has their own personal convictions for choosing it. Personally, I find the DG model to be so compelling because of the following two reasons:  If you choose to invest in the best dividend-paying companies you will always have a paycheck regardless of market conditions. Historically speaking, companies that consistently grew dividends saw the greatest average returns from the beginning of 1972 to the end of 2017.  Retirees who do not have a pension plan tend to look at their retirement based on the total dollar amount available if they were to liquidate their holdings. The classic rule of 4% is another way I have seen the average person explain their retirement because it is a simple way of understanding what can potentially be a large number. In reality, the 4% rule is unrealistic as large market swings can create major fluctuations in portfolio balances. This method places too much emphasis on the total balance of their portfolio as they expect they will need to draw down the balance of this account over the remaining years of their life. This method is inherently risky based on the fact that we are expecting the market will provide optimal returns during this time frame. A simple analogy for this situation is to think of your retirement fund as a job where the pay comes in the form of a small salary/wage with a bonus that varies drastically based on how the company performs. The DG methodology takes the opposite approach because these investors are more concerned about the consistency of their paycheck which comes in the form of interest, dividends, and distributions. For the DGI, they are rather unconcerned about the total value of the account and are more concerned with making sure they are invested in companies that offer products and services that will keep them in business (through the good times and bad). When thinking about the DGI model it would be comparable to taking a salaried job with an optional/smaller bonus at the end of the year that can vary depending on how the company does.\\n When we begin to view our portfolios from these two paradigms we can begin to understand why the first scenario (small wage and unpredictable small/large bonus) is an extreme risk to a retiree\\'s well-being. The second scenario offers a reasonable level of predictability because of the consistency for the best companies to pay out increasing dividends year-after-year which makes it a more promising choice for the investor who is looking to reduce risk. For those of you who are number people, I want to drive the point home by looking at some hypothetical figures for a DGI named John. John\\'s DGI Portfolio - Example Scenarios In this scenario, I am using John as a hypothetical example of a person who has saved a significant nest egg and running his DGI portfolio through two scenarios spanning the range of 2000-2009 (a poor decade of returns) and 2007-2016 (considered to be a much better decade of returns). Here are the main details of this hypothetical scenario:  John $1,000,000 in retirement funds and are all invested in dividend growth stocks. John subscribes collects all dividends as cash. When the market has a positive return he takes a set bonus of $20,000 (scenario one) and a $40,000 bonus (scenario two). When the market has a negative return he takes no bonus and continues to use his dividends as his sole source of income. John\\'s base wage (remember, the wage represents interest, dividends, and distributions) and starts at $50,000 and increases 5% annually (assumes an average dividend growth rate of 5%).  Now, we also need to make some assumptions about the scenario because it is too difficult to control for every minute detail. In this scenario we are assuming the following:  The growth/decline for the year is the total impact on capital appreciation. The dividend is excluded from this figure since John is collecting it as cash. The dividend is assumed to remain stable and growing (for instance, no cuts in 2008 during a major downturn). All \"bonus\" withdrawals are coming at the very end of the year after the gain on the portfolio has been accounted for. The beginning dividend payments of $50k are based on a 5% yield on $1,000,000. This income stays the same (plus 5% annual growth going forward) regardless of how the market performs (AKA, the new yield for each following year is not based on 5% of the new portfolio balance). Portfolio growth figures are based on the returns of the S&P 500. \\n John\\'s DGI Portfolio - Scenario One I was most interested to see how a DGI portfolio would\\'ve performed from 2000-2009 if we applied the bullet points that dictates John\\'s approach. I consider the 2000-2009 time frame to represent a period with greater risk given the average portfolio growth during that decade was approximately 1.2%. \\n\\n I have used the time period of 2000-2009 because it represents situation where it is extremely difficult to try and build a portfolio that generates solid capital appreciation. Any time we use a historical period where the starting years are represented by losses (in this case, the first three years represent major losses) it will always create a significant setback to the example at hand. In John\\'s case, these years of setback only had an impact on his bonus because the stocks he bought into continued to pay increasing dividends during those three years (for any naysayers out there, there were plenty of companies that did this). Once the market recovered, John was able to continue enjoying his growing dividends while simultaneously drawing a bonus check of $20,000/year during the \"good times\". Even in this poor return scenario, John\\'s DGI portfolio produced the following results:  An average wage income of approximately $62,900/year. An average bonus income of approximately $12,000/year. An average total income of approximately $74,900/year.  Not too bad for a decade with average capital appreciation of 1.2%, right? Had we continued with this scenario into the years of second phase in the next section, we would have seen John\\'s account make a significant recovery that would have eventually exceeded his $1,000,000 starting position even after accounting for his $20k annual bonuses.\\n John\\'s DGI Portfolio - Scenario Two In the second scenario, I explored the following questions:  What happens when a DGI portfolio goes through a period of solid returns? Will a DGI portfolio offer enough growth for a DGI\\'s taste? Since times are so good, what if the bonus in this scenario increases from $20,000/year to $40,000/year?  This time frame runs from 2007-2016 and uses the same assumptions as the first scenario (with the exception of an increased bonus). \\n\\n During this time frame, the average annualized portfolio growth was approximately 8.8% (I consider this to represent a strong decade of growth) and there was only one year (2008) where John did not receive his $40,000 bonus on top of his normal \"wage\". Although this decade produced strong results it is not an overly optimistic time frame because it takes into account the -37% loss in 2008 (and remember, the earlier the hit the harder it is to recover. John\\'s portfolio would\\'ve produced the following results:  An average wage income of approximately $62,900/year. An average bonus income of approximately $36,000/year. An average total income of approximately $98,800/year.  It\\'s also interesting when we consider that John\\'s income increases at the same pace as it did in the first scenario Investor Takeaway From John\\'s Scenarios The purpose of a DGI portfolio is to remove risk regardless of whether the market is declining or rallying (as shown in the two scenarios above) by providing a steady stream of income that is necessary for a retiree to feel stable. By adopting this method, we are reducing the chance that we will need to time the market by having to sell equities when we need the income. Timing the market when building an investment portfolio is difficult (if not impossible) but it is even worse to have spent your life accumulating wealth only to bet that the market will continue to have \"good years\" as the main source of certainty in retirement. Needless to say, betting on capital appreciation and positive stock gains represents a significant risk to the long-term balance of an investment portfolio.\\n \\n\\n^DJI data by YCharts Consider this observation about the above chart regarding an investor who dependent on their bonus as a major source of retirement income and who is waiting to withdraw their \"bonus\" until the end of the year:  If the portfolio is primarily composed of stocks in the DJIA the investors would be losing -$.142 for every dollar they withdraw from their investment portfolio. (Compared to having sold stocks and withdrawn funds on October 1st, 2018). If the portfolio is primarily composed of stocks in the S&P 500 the investors would be losing -$.156 for every dollar they withdraw from their investment portfolio. (Compared to having sold stocks and withdrawn funds on October 1st, 2018). If the portfolio is primarily composed of stocks in the NASDAQ Composite the investors would be losing -$.188 for every dollar they withdraw from their investment portfolio. (Compared to having sold stocks and withdrawn funds on October 1st, 2018).  Here is another way to think about the information above: \\n\\n First of all, I won\\'t try and pretend that the losses from October 1st to December 21st were avoidable (we can\\'t avoid this drop in value assuming the portfolio composition is the same in both scenarios). However, what we can acknowledge is that the highlighted column represents the amount that is costing the investor because they are withdrawing money that has since been devalued. With these figures in mind, who in the normal work-world would ever consider a job with almost no regular wage but the potential for a large bonus at the end of the year. Sure, some may agree to a plan like this if they are working for a startup but that validates our premise that a person who signs up for that plan is agreeing to the risk because they see the potential reward. For a retiree, this risk is unacceptable because there is no do-over button that is offered to us when we reach retirement. A DGI portfolio represents an easy method for maintaining a balance between \"wages\" and \"bonuses\" (which again) helps reduce risk tremendously.\\n Defining What Risk Means To You When I am looking at my clients\\' retirement portfolios I\\'m constantly considering the various risks (existing and potential) that could have a real impact on their retirement portfolio. I tend to think of risk as something that can derail my clients\\' from achieving their goals which is why it is important to understand that only can you determine the risks if you know what the clients\\' hopes, dreams, and goals are. Here is an example of a simple goal but viewed through three different perspectives:  Client A - Wants to buy a home in Arizona and pay for it entirely with cash upfront (no payments). Client B - Wants to buy a home in Arizona and is open to paying a combination of cash upfront and financing the rest. Client C - Want to rent a home in Arizona and has no intention of buying.  Although all three clients\\' want to have a home in Arizona, all three of them have a different perspective as to how they would like to achieve that goal. Ironically, I believe that client A\\'s request represents the most risk because they have decided that payments are something they don\\'t want and will need the cash upfront. Therefore, we will need to make sure that we will need to set aside these funds in the safest possible investment (like a CD) since any major market fluctuations could have a significant impact on the overall value of their portfolio. In other words, it doesn\\'t take much for a $250,000 home to cost $300,000 because the funds being used to purchase it has declined in value due to unfavorable market conditions. As such, these types of scenarios will impact how much cash flow the client will need in order to sustain the lifestyle they want to live. It is important to reiterate that there is no scenario were absolutely no risk exists and so DGIs must be realistic in their expectations. After all, if Client A is unwilling to budge on their desire for no payments then they must also be willing to accept that their monthly \"wage\" will be lower since funds for this home in Arizona will likely be placed in a short-term CD with no capital appreciation and a minimal dividend/interest paid.\\n Measuring Risk In My Clients\\' Taxable Portfolio We have established so far that investments carry risk but what about the risk of composition in a portfolio? I am not referring to the mixture of investment types (bonds, stocks, etc.) as much as I am looking at each specific investment type and the number of individual positions that results in 100% of the total market value associated with each specific investment type. The type of risk in a portfolio comes in two forms:  The size of a position relative to the total value of the portfolio. The amount of income relative to the total income of the portfolio.  It can be a major risk to have too much exposure to a single company regardless of the size of your portfolio. The size of a position and the amount of income it generates can have dire consequences on a DGI\\'s portfolio in the event that the dividend is cut, eliminated, or the company folds. Unfortunately, many investors who have not saved enough to adequately meet their retirement needs end up relying on these types of investments to provide a significant portion of the income they need. While high-yield investments can be helpful to boost income, investors should make sure that their total exposure to any single high-yield investment remains limited. Since it is the end of the year, I wanted to take a look at my clients\\' John and Jane\\'s Taxable portfolio to see if there are any positions that are responsible for too much of the total portfolio\\'s value or income. Disclaimer: The figures shown below represent a real portfolio that I manage for my clients. This article is not intended to serve as advice and is for informational purposes only. It is important that you do your own research and create a portfolio that meets your investment needs! For clarification, some of the information in the table below is derived from my Taxable Account Tracker that is used in my John & Jane series. \\n\\n\\n The table above is color-coded to show the following:  Green = % of income or % of total market value between 0%-3% Yellow = % of income or % of total market value between 3.01%-5% Red = % of income or % of total market value 5% or greater.  The purpose of these colors is to help the investor identify whether or not a specific position makes up too much of their total portfolio (in this case, I use market value) and if the income generated by that position represents too much of the total portfolio income. Here are some general observations that I found interesting:  Only one position exceeds my 5% market value limitation and it is Eaton Vance Floating-Rate Advantage Fund A (EAFAX) which isn\\'t a major problem because it is composed of primarily senior secured bank loans. These loans are typically below investment grade and have floating rate tied to LIBOR. As such, interest payments received should continue to increase although the risk of a loan going bad is also increased. Positions with a total market value of 3.01%-5% are primarily composed of large companies that are well-known and who have entrenched business models. Some examples of this include Verizon (VZ), Simon Property Group (SPG), Altria (MO), Clorox (CLX), and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL). ORI currently shows that it was responsible for 6.36% of the income generated in the 2018 Taxable Portfolio. This is largely due to the special dividend of $1.00/share that was paid in January of 2018 and more than doubled its effective dividend yield. If we remove this special payment then we see ORI is right in line with where we would expect it to be, based on its current dividend of $.195/share per quarter. The high-quality positions that tend to make up a large amount of the total market value typically generate a low-to-modest amount of total income. Small positions with higher yields are used sparingly to boost yield. A good example of equities like this from the list that fit this description includes Energy Transfer (ET) and Arbor Realty (ABR). \\n Conclusion When I look at the portfolio using the income generated from 2018 I can say that I am comfortable with the current standing of their equity positions. Most of the market value exposure is rooted in companies with strong business models and have a reason to exist. At the same time, we have included small positions in some equities that I would consider slightly risky because they increase the income generated significantly even though they represent only a small amount of the total market value. I believe that John and Jane\\'s portfolio composition (market value and income) looks solid from a 2018 perspective. In the near future, I will be using the same analysis to determine how the portfolio looks based on 2019 dividend estimates. One of the problems with looking backward is that a number of companies that were added in the last 2-3 months of 2018 did not generate a meaningful amount of income. This includes:  Legget & Platt (LEG) Phillips 66 Partners (PSXP) Schlumberger (SLB) United Technologies (UTX)  My 2019 analysis will be based on FY-2019 dividend estimates that will provide a more accurate assessment of how the portfolio is positioned and the market value/income risk in 2019. Given the recent turbulence in the market, we have been focusing on adding high-quality equities to John and Jane\\'s Taxable Portfolio because there are stocks offering dividend yields that haven\\'t been available for more than a year. At this point, John and Jane\\'s portfolio has enough risk associated with it and we are not attempting to boost the yield more than we already have. In this sense, we have found the \"sweet spot\" concerning the % of total market value and % of total income. In John and Jane\\'s Taxable account, they are currently long the following mentioned in this article: Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL), Arbor Realty (ABR), Archer Daniels Midland (ADM), Apple REIT (APLE), BP (BP), Buckeye Partners (BPL), Cardinal Health (CAH), Clorox (CLX), Cummins (CMI), Eaton Vance Floating-Rate Advantage Fund A (EAFAX), Emerson Electric (EMR), EPR Properties (EPR), Energy Transfer (ET), General Mills (GIS), Helmerich & Payne (HP), Hormel (HRL), Iron Mountain (IRM), Johnson Controls (JCI), LTC Properties (LTC), Leggett & Platt (LEG), Macquarie Infrastructure (MIC), Altria (MO), Mesabi Trust (MSB), New Residential (NRZ), Realty Income (O), Old Republic International (ORI), Phillips 66 Partners (PSXP), Spectra Energy Partners (SEP), J.M.

Then I will discuss the exciting initiatives that we are implementing to position us to leverage the new opportunities that we are seeing emerge in the telecommunications market.\\nAs you may have seen from our recent press releases, we are affecting major changes in all areas of our business, most significantly divesting the Cable TV segment; implementing strategically forms at both Nave and Triton to improve efficiencies in our Telco segment; and we’re acquiring a new wireless infrastructure services business, further diversifying our Telco offering and allowing us to target new customers in the wireless market. These initiatives are expected to transform the company’s prospects and to drive shareholder value.\\nRevenues for fiscal 2018 declined 3% year-over-year. This decline was driven by ongoing trends in the Cable TV market that have impacted top line revenues over the past decade. These declines resulted primarily from the consolidation of cable television operators and major Cable TV OEMs, as well as an overall decrease in bandwidth upgrades by the cable operators.\\nThese industry-wide trends led to a 13% decline in Cable TV segment revenues year-over-year, caused in part by losing a large repair business customer in the first quarter of 2018. This impacted all subsequent quarterly results. This reduction in top line revenues forced us to close three of our repair facilities and downsize headcount at our remaining repair locations.\\nWe have talked at length about the challenges facing the Cable segment on previous earnings calls, and we have talked about our plan to adapt to these changing market conditions by focusing our growth strategy on the Telco segment, where we believe there are significant opportunity to expand the breadth of our services and the size of our customer base. The Cable TV underperformance this year once again, validated this strategic direction.\\nAs mentioned on our last earnings call, after being appointed CEO in ADDvantage Technologies in July of this year, we initiated a comprehensive operational review of our existing business units to analyze our company fundamentals and establish a framework for growth.\\nAs a result of this review, we now have a clear plan of action to divest the Cable TV segment operations and to focus our resources in the Telco segment, both by improving its existing operations and by entering complementary verticals within the telecom market. We have already made material progress towards these objectives.\\nOn December 26, we entered into an agreement to sell the Cable TV segment for $10.3 million to a company controlled by Dave Chymiak, who is our Chief Technology Officer, Director and a substantial shareholder. This sale is subject to shareholder approval, which we anticipate occurring in our third fiscal quarter of 2019.\\nDave is the original Founder of Tulsat, and we believe that this sale will allow Dave the flexibility to rejuvenate the cable business, as he sees fit and to provide a fresh start for the dedicated employees within the Cable segment that have been with him for over 25 years. Dave will no longer be an employee of ADDvantage, but will continue as a member of our Board of Directors.\\nIn November, we closed on the sale of the Cable TV segment Broken Arrow, Oklahoma facility for $5 million in cash, also to a company controlled by Dave Chymiak. We will lease the facility from Dave’s company, which will allow us to continue to carry out our Cable TV operations until such time that we complete the sale of the Cable TV segment.\\nThe sale of Cable TV, combined with the recent sale of the Broken Arrow facility, will inject over $15 million into our business. When finalized, our transition out of the Cable TV segment will allow us to redirect our resources into the telecommunications market, where we see significantly – significant opportunity for growth.\\n\\nThe insights derived from our operational review have already helped to identify opportunities to grow and diversify our revenue streams within Telco. Don Kinison, VP of Sales; Scott Francis, our CFO; and myself spent the month of July, visiting our Telco locations in Miami and Baltimore, as well as with Telco telecom in Huntsville, Alabama.\\nWe met with our management teams, observed operations, asked questions and more importantly, listened to the people in the field explain how they could reduce cost, improve efficiency and grow their business. We have put in place several initiatives that are intended to build on our existing Telco offering and drive improved financial performance in both the near and the long-term.\\nAs a reminder, our existing operations in the telecom market consist of our Nave Communications and Triton Datacom businesses. Nave Communications is a provider of quality used telecommunications networking equipment to telecommunication carriers and brokers, primarily in the U.S. Triton Datacom provides new and refurbished enterprise networking products, including desktop phones, enterprise switches and wireless routers to brokers and end users across the U.S.\\nIn fiscal 2018, we reported a 6% increase in Telco segment sales, driven by a solid performance at both Triton Datacom and Nave Communications, which both reported slightly improved results year-over-year. Nave’s improved results were a result of the new strategy and restructuring initiatives implemented earlier in the fiscal year, which strengthened its business model and drove sales growth.\\nWhile we are encouraged by this progress, we believe there is room to improve the running of this business and are taking steps to further optimize operational efficiencies and maximize its revenue potential.\\nIn September of 2018, we moved Nave’s operations from Baltimore, Maryland to a world-class third-party reverse logistics partner, Palco Telecom, located at Huntsville, Alabama. This move will allow Nave to begin serving a much wider geographic customer base, opening up additional sales and revenue opportunities.\\nThe movement of inventory and order fulfillment operations will also streamline operations and improve shipping times across the U.S., which will contribute to lower operating costs. Over the years, Nave has built up a diverse long-term customer base and sells well-known trusted products from top OEMs, including Cisco, Adtran, Lucent, Ciena and Fujitsu.\\nWe’re building on this background to reposition Nave as a high-quality option for used telecom equipment, in response to an increase customer and industry demand for higher-quality products. This path forward combines the best attributes of Nave’s operation with Telco’s experience and dedication to quality.\\nTo advance this goal, we are improving our testing and certification capabilities to ensure the highest-quality products will be delivered to our customers. Further more, with the move to Telco and our increased investment in testing equipment made plans to begin offering customers repair services in late 2019. We believe that by offering a broader suite of solutions and better quality products to our customers, we will generate increased top line revenue and profitability for Nave.\\nNow moving on to Triton, which reported a $0.3 million increase in 2018 sales compared with the prior year. While this performance was in line with our expectations, we have been focused on identifying ways in which we can strengthen Triton’s operating performance.\\nAs a result of our internal operation review, we determined that our current facility was hindering our ability to perform efficiently. This prompted our decision to relocate our Triton operation to a new facility just down the road that will allow us to refurbish more customer-prem units per person and also will expand our models that we refurbish by focusing on additional manufacturers that our customers are requesting.\\n\\nIn addition, we identified new product lines that we plan to stock in order to reach a broader customer base and open more sales opportunities. As a result, we are investing in additional new and refurbished inventory, but with a commitment to buy what we know we can sell.\\nWe believe that together, the move of our facility in 2019 and investing in additional inventory product lines across multiple manufacturers, will provide the platform for us to grow Triton’s top line revenues and improve its overall bottom line results.\\nBefore turning the call over to Scott to discuss the financial results, I’m going to now talk about one of our most exciting initiatives for 2019. We recently announced our decision to enter into the wireless infrastructure services market. This comes when all major U.S. carriers are planning to roll out 5G in the wireless space over the next five to 10 years.\\nTo accelerate this strategy, yesterday, we announced that we entered into an asset purchase agreement to acquire the assets of both Fulton Technologies and Mill City Communications for a purchase price of $1.7 million. These two wireless infrastructure services companies have strong reputations in the wireless services industry and maintain solid contractual relationships with the four major U.S. wireless carriers, the national integrators and original equipment manufacturers that support the wireless carriers.\\nWe anticipate that the purchase price plus integration costs would be similar to the costs we could have incurred to launch these services platform from scratch, while providing the additional benefit of an experienced operational team, great crews and a preexisting revenue stream from the major customers in the industry.\\nOnce we finalize the acquisition and integrate these two companies into our business, it should increase our total addressable market significantly, which should diversify our revenue streams and drive long-term sustainable growth. Most importantly, it gives us a wireless services platform in the Midwest and Southwest that we can scale with the growth of the emerging 5G market opportunity.\\nWe look forward to providing more updates on subsequent earnings calls, as we move forward with these strategic initiatives.\\nWith that, I will now turn the call over to Scott Francis, our CFO, to take you through the financial results for the year. Scott, please go ahead.\\nScott Francis\\nThank you, Joe. For the fiscal fourth quarter of 2018, our total sales decreased 12% to $10.9 million from $12.3 million for the same period of last year. Our sales for the Cable TV segment decreased $600,000 to $4.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2018 from $5.2 million for the same period of last year.\\nThe decrease in sales was due to a decrease in repair service revenues and in refurbished equipment sales of $600,000 and $200,000 respectfully, partially offset by an increase in new equipment revenue of $200,000. The decrease in repair service revenue was due primarily to the loss of a large repair business customer in the first fiscal quarter of 2018, as Joe referenced earlier.\\nSales to the Telco segment decreased $800,000 to $6.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2018 from $7.1 million for the same period of last year. The decrease in sales for the Telco segment was due to a decrease in equipment sales and recycling revenue of $700,000 and $100,000, respectfully.\\nThe decrease in Telco equipment sales was due primarily to Nave due in part to disruptions caused by the move of the Nave inventory, warehousing and fulfillment operations to Palco Telecom. The decrease in our recycling revenues due primarily to timing of recycling shipments for the quarter.\\nOur consolidated gross profit decreased $1.9 million, or 57% to $1.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2018 from $3.3 million for the same period of last year. The decrease in gross profit was in the Cable TV segment and Telco segment of $1.7 million and $200,000, respectfully.\\n\\nThe Cable TV segment’s gross profit was negatively impacted by an increase in our reserve for excess and obsolete inventory of $1.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2018, as compared to $150,000 for the same period of last year. Consolidated operating and general administrative expenses remained relatively flat at $3.6 million for both years.\\nWe recorded a restructuring charge of $900,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2018, in connection with our decision to move Nave’s inventory management and order fulfillment operations to Palco. As a result, we incurred the following charges at Nave.\\nFirst, we recorded an intangible impairment charge of $400,000 related to inventory tracking software that will no longer be utilized; secondly, we’ve incurred moving expenses of $400,000 to transfer Nave’s inventory from a facility in Baltimore, Maryland to Palco’s facility in Huntsville, Alabama; and thirdly, we incurred severance expenses of $100,000 for Nave’s operations employees.\\nOur provision for income taxes for the three months ended September 30, 2018 was $1.7 million. We recorded provision for income taxes for the quarter, although, we had pre-tax losses due primarily to a valuation allowance that we provided of $2.6 million that was recorded against our deferred tax assets.\\nNet loss for the three months ended September 30, 2018 was $4.8 million, or a loss of $0.47 per share, compared with a net loss of $300,000, or $0.03 per share for the same period last year. Our adjusted EBITDA for the three months ended September 30, 2018 was a loss of $1.8 million, compared with income of $100,000 for the same period ended September 30, 2017.\\nNow moving on to the 12 months results. For the 12 months ended September 30, 2018, our total sales were $47.4 million, down from $48.7 million for the 12 months ended September 30, 2017. Sales of the Cable TV segment decreased $2.9 million to $19.9 million for the 12 months ended September 30, 2018 from $22.8 for the same period of last year.\\nThe decrease in sales was due primarily to a decrease of $2.8 million and $1.3 million in repair services revenues and refurbished equipment sales, respectfully, partially offset by an increase of $1.2 million in equipment sales. The decrease in repair service revenues due primarily to the loss of a large repair business customer in the first fiscal quarter of 2018.\\nAs a result of this loss, in 2018, the company closed three of its repair facilities and reduced personnel at its remaining repair facilities. The decrease in the refurbished equipment sales was due primarily to an overall decrease in demand for the year ended September 30, 2018, as compared to the prior year.\\nSales for the Telco segment increased $1.5 million to $27.5 million for the 12 months ended September 30, 2018, from $25.9 million for the same period of last year. The increase in sales resulted from an increase in equipment sales of $1.6 million, partially offset by a decrease in recycling revenue of $100,000.\\nThe increase in Telco equipment sales was due primarily to increased sales in Nave Communications and Triton Datacom of $1.2 million and $300,000, respectfully. The increase in equipment sales at Nave can be attributed in part to the company addressing the lower equipment sales that have been experiencing over the past several quarters by restructuring its sales force and implementing a new sales strategy, as Joe referenced earlier.\\nConsolidated gross profit decreased $3.6 million, or 24% to $11.2 million for 2018, from $14.8 million for 2017. The decrease in gross profit was due to a decrease in the Cable TV segment of $3.9 million, partially offset by an increase in the Telco segment of $300,000.\\nThe Cable TV segment’s gross profit was negatively impacted by an increase in our reserve for excess and obsolete inventory of $1.8 million for the year ended September 30, 2018, as compared to $600,000 for the same period of last year. Also, as discussed earlier, we recorded a restructuring charge of $900,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2018, in connection with our decision to move Nave’s inventory management and order fulfillment operations to Palco.\\n\\nWe recorded a goodwill impairment charge of $1.2 million for the year ended September 30, 2018, which represented the carrying value of goodwill for the Cable TV segment. Since there were indicators of possible impairment in the Cable TV segment, we performed a goodwill impairment analysis in our third quarter of 2018.\\nThese indicators included lower operating results from the Cable TV segment, compared to the same quarters in the prior year, lower projected results and management discussions surrounding various strategic alternatives, given the lower operating performance. This analysis resulted us in reporting a goodwill impairment charge.\\nOther income and expense, primarily consists of activity related to our investment in YKTG Solutions, including equity earnings and losses. Equity losses for the year ended September 30, 2018 were $300,000 and zero for the year ended September 30, 2017. The equity losses for September 30, 2018 consisted primarily of a legal settlement with our subcontractor on the YKTG Solutions wireless cell tower decommissioning project and its associated legal expenses.\\nOur provision for income taxes for the year ended September 30, 2018 was $1.6 million. We recorded a provision for income taxes for the quarter, although, we had pre-tax losses due primarily to a valuation allowance we provided at $2.6 million that was recorded against our deferred tax assets.\\nOur net loss for the 12-month period ended September 30, 2018 was $7.3 million, or a loss of $0.71 per share. Adjusted EBITDA for the 12 months ended September 30, 2018 was a loss of $1.5 million, compared with income of $1.9 million for the same period ended last year. Cash and cash equivalents were $3.1 million as of September 30, 2018, compared with $4 million as of September 30, 2017.\\nNow I would like to discuss in more detail some of the major transactions that have occurred subsequent to September 30, 2018 for which many of these Joe has already discussed.\\nIn December 2018, we entered into an agreement with the company controlled by Dave Chymiak to sell our Cable TV segment for $10.3 million. This sale is subject to shareholder approval, which we anticipate occurring in our third fiscal quarter of 2019. The purchase price will consist of $3.9 million of cash and $6.4 million promissory note to be paid in semi-annual installments over five years, with an interest rate of 6%. We estimate that this sale will result in a pre-tax loss of approximately $2.8 million.\\nIn November 18, we closed on an agreement with a company controlled by Dave Chymiak to sell our Broken Arrow facility for $5 million in cash. This facility contains our operations of one of our Cable TV segment subsidiaries, Tulsat, and our company’s headquarters. This transaction resulted in a pre-tax gain of $1.4 million.\\nIn connection with the sale of this facility, Tulsat entered into a 10-year lease with Mr. Chymiak, for a monthly rent of $44,000, or $528,000 per year. As a result of this leaseback transaction, the pre-tax gain of $1.4 million resulting from the sale will be deferred over the lease period.\\nIn October/November 2018, we used internal funds and cash provided by the sale of our Broken Arrow facility to payoff our outstanding term loans and line of credit with our primary financial lender totaling $2.6 million. Therefore, we are now no longer under our forbearance agreement with the Bank of Oklahoma.\\nThen in December 2018, we entered into another credit agreement with a different financial lender. This credit agreement contains a $2.5 million revolving line of credit facility and matures on December 17th of 2019.\\nThis concludes the financial overview section of our remarks right now. I will now turn the call over to the operator for questions.\\n\\nQuestion-and-Answer Session\\nOperator\\nThank you. [Operator Instructions] We’ll take our first question from Michael Hess with Hess Investments.\\nMichael Hess\\nThank you very much. I’m – first of all, just wanted to understand when we sell the Cable TV business? And when we sold our facility and, for example, the Cable TV business, vis-à-vis, we lose $2.8 million. Is that already in the September 30th numbers, or that will be in the December numbers, or when will those hit?\\nJoseph Hart\\nYes. This is Joe Hart. Scott, you want to answer that?\\nScott Francis\\nYes, I will. Thank you, Michael. So these transactions were all subsequent to September 30. So these actual gains and losses resulting from the cable transactions, you referenced, will occur in December. And then later, it’s a little complicated, because the gain on the building sale actually because of the nature of the transaction minus sales leaseback will actually occur over the 10-year lease. And then the loss on the sale of the cable transaction will actually not occur until shareholder approval, which we anticipate in our third quarter. So you won’t actually see that until that point in time.\\nNow with that said, once that occurs, which we believe it will, then the actual gain and resulting from that building transaction will actually get rolled into that – will actually get rolled into the loss on the cable transaction, because now Cable won’t be part of this. So it’ll be a net approximate $1.4 million is what we’re thinking at the end of the day, that will get recorded. But that again, won’t be until the third quarter.\\nMichael Hess\\nThank you. And how does the Cable TV sale work? I know we’re selling it, I guess, for less than inventory. Are we selling off inventory between now in the third quarter, or certain liabilities being sent over to the buyers? How does the sale work?\\nJoseph Hart\\nYes. Scott, you might as well stay with it.\\nScott Francis\\nI will do that. Okay. So, Michael, again, with that, we are actually selling the stock of the – of those companies of all the different cable companies that comprise that segment. There’s five of them. So it is the entire net asset position of the business itself. So it’s not just except for cash.\\nSo really what happens there is, it’s not just inventory, it’s AR/AP, all the liabilities associated with it. And so that’s just the way it’s all turning out as it all – subject to the $2.8 million loss after you remove the facility for – the Broken Arrow facility, it’s a net – it’s effectively a net asset sale, net of the $2.8 million loss. That’s how…\\nMichael Hess\\nAnd will you be able to sell off inventory between now and the third quarter? Does that go to them, or is it like a working capital adjustment, like how does that work?\\nJoseph Hart\\nThere’s a traditional working capital adjustment as in every deal. But yes, the company will operate as is where it is until such point as a shareholder approval in the third quarter. So it is still ADDvantage’s business, profits, everything still come to ADDvantage in that period of time, right, until that shareholder approval takes place. So it’s still our company to operate.\\nMichael Hess\\nThank you very much.\\nJoseph Hart\\nYou’re very welcome.\\nOperator\\nAnd we’ll take our next question from [George Gaspar] [ph].\\nUnidentified Analyst\\nYes. Thank you. Good morning. Just an ongoing question regarding the previous question. How do you handle the sale and the rental cost? Can you identify if the facilities, because much of the facility there was handled for the cable operation and its inventory. How does that all gets cranked up in terms of your future rental costs post – past the execution of this agreement to sell the cable operation?\\nJoseph Hart\\nYes. Thank you, George. I’m just going to ask Scott to stay with it. These are all in the same vein. So, Scott, take it away.\\n\\nScott Francis\\nOkay. So, George, I may need you to kind of – I kind of lost where your – what your real question was there. So can you help me on what – on – I kind of lost where you were going. You’re asking about how – what – how the rental expense is going to affect ADDvantage in terms of what?\\nUnidentified Analyst\\nWell, here you’ve made a deal to sell. You’ve already got a transaction selling the facilities, which you’re now renting. But the rent, I assume that the rent covers the operation of the cable operation within the facilities. When the sale is affected selling the cable operation, you will no longer be utilizing a significant part of those facilities.\\nScott Francis\\nRight.\\nUnidentified Analyst\\nWill that change the rent cost structure associated with the continuing company ADDvantage Technologies?\\nScott Francis\\nOkay. Now I’m following where we’re going now. So what will happen is, we sold our Broken Arrow facility, which held Tulsat and our headquarters. What’ll happen is, upon the sale, summation in the third quarter, we will move our headquarters, people, which is less than 20 folks to a different facility. That’s why we – and have some rent expense, but it’ll be a nominal expense there on a month-over-month basis. We’ll go into an office space here.\\nThat’s one reason why we affected the lease being at Tulsat, not at ADDvantage. So that way, when the sale takes place, Dave will – and as a company, we’ll effectively get the 10-year lease of the facility, right? Does that make sense and/or does that answer your question?\\nUnidentified Analyst\\nSo I assume that there’s going to be some accounting adjustments here in terms of the cost structure related to the parent company versus netting out after the sale of Tulsat is completed?\\nScott Francis\\nSo…\\nUnidentified Analyst\\nThe cable operation, excuse me?\\nScott Francis\\nWell, there’ll be – yes, there’ll be all sorts of adjustments that we’ll be going through more likely than not. I don’t want to speak completely out of term, but this will be – have to be going through a restatement process for discontinued operations and so forth. So…\\nUnidentified Analyst\\nGotcha.\\nScott Francis\\n…this will be a complete rework in terms of the financials that what you’ll be seeing retro and post, right?\\nUnidentified Analyst\\nRight.\\nScott Francis\\nSo that way you can see everything.\\nUnidentified Analyst\\nOkay. And then in summation on this, it sounds like ultimately, you could move the ADDvantage Technologies’ headquarter elsewhere from its previous location?\\nScott Francis\\nYes. Well, ADDvantage headquarters is basically a back-office, personnel, so it’s HR, IT, accounting folks and we can move them into an office space relatively easily. We’re not dealing with 10 floors of people or anything like that. It won’t be a hard move for us.\\nUnidentified Analyst\\nGreat. And if I could ask an additional question on the 5G concept. How long do you see it taking to get operational in that area…\\nJoseph Hart\\nThis is Joe. Thanks, George.\\nUnidentified Analyst\\n… beyond what you’re acquiring? Yes.\\nJoseph Hart\\nWell, we are going to be taking over existing operations teams. So…\\nUnidentified Analyst\\nOkay.\\nJoseph Hart\\n…the Fulton and Mill City companies, they have standing operations in Dallas, Chicago and Minneapolis.\\nUnidentified Analyst\\nI see.\\nJoseph Hart\\nAnd they have existing management teams and existing tower crews and small cell construction crews. So this – these are entities that have been operating for more than 20 years and are well-known to the wireless community and have a book of business that they bring with them. And it’s a platform that we think we can really scale-up nicely, as the business starts to emerge for the 5G growth pattern.\\nUnidentified Analyst\\nOkay. And can you tell us this. What’s the initial revenue stream that could come along with the acquisition that you’re making – that you made?\\n\\nJoseph Hart\\nYes. The current – yes, well, I would just say that the current business for them for the – for calendar year 2018, it’s about approximately $20 million in revenue.\\nUnidentified Analyst\\nI see.\\nJoseph Hart\\nAnd we expect that we’ll launch some additional growth initiatives, which will build that up in calendar 2019.\\nUnidentified Analyst\\nI see. Well, that’s good. That sounds very perspective. Thank you, kindly.\\nJoseph Hart\\nYou’re welcome. Thanks, George.\\nOperator\\nWe’ll take our next question from Sam Rebotsky with SER Asset Management.\\nSam Rebotsky\\nYes. Good afternoon, gentlemen. Could you sort of continuing on the sale of the transaction, it states we estimate the sale will result in a pre-tax loss of approximately $2.8 million. Does that take into consideration any goodwill you’re carrying on the books that hasn’t been written off? And does that take into consideration till the time of the sale, the losses that will occur up until that timeframe?\\nJoseph Hart\\nYes. Thanks for your question, Sam. I’m just going to deflect that one to Scott, since he’s on a role here.\\nScott Francis\\nYes. Thanks, Joe. So, Sam, good question. In the third quarter of this year, we had already written off all of the goodwill related to the Cable segment. So that the goodwill values there on the Cable segment have – are zero now, so there is nothing left there.\\nAs far as the loss that we have anticipated, the $2.8 million, it does not try to project in any gain – income or loss that the Cable segment maybe having over the next several months right until the sale is taking place. That is as of – that’s as of the date of the – entered into the agreement a couple of days ago, right?\\nSam Rebotsky\\nOkay. So the loss of $2.8 million is as of the 20 – December 26?\\nScott Francis\\nYes. It’s an estimate as of that date, but yes.\\nSam Rebotsky\\nSo to the extent it closes, you expect the third quarter to get approval. So you’re talking about six-month timeframe. And the fact that we lost $2.6 million –about $2.6 million for the Cable for the year ending September 30, 2018, that sort of gives you the – as much losses as you might expect for the period that till the closing?\\nScott Francis\\nI’m not – I don’t know really how Cable is going to perform. So here’s what I would tell you is to the extent that cables, performance continues on the same trajectory that it has any net income or losses that Cable has, ADDvantage will absorb, because it is still our entity as part of our net income.\\nAnd as I was mentioning to George earlier, ultimately, we will be restating our financials as discontinued operations and then ADDvantage will then show the continuing of the Telco segment with also now the new wireless infrastructure business and then the Cable segments will be collapsed into the discontinued operations segment.\\nSam Rebotsky\\nOkay.\\nScott Francis\\nAnd so – but answer your question, yes, but it will be absorbed into ADDvantage, not as the gain/loss on the transaction. I just want to make sure we’re – that’s clear.\\nSam Rebotsky\\nOkay. I just trying to sort of make some kind of rationale based on the numbers you’ve shown in the loss you project in, and that seems logical. Now, let me look at the year-end, the Cable TV showed that $2,570 million loss and the Telco showed $2,623 million. And you’re carrying the substantial goodwill. How do we substantiate and sort of with these losses on the Telco sort of maintain the goodwill that we have?\\nScott Francis\\nJoe, you may go ahead and take that.\\nJoseph Hart\\nYes. Sorry, Scott.\\nScott Francis\\nThat’s fine. So, Sam, we do our analysis on goodwill each year. So Telco – Cables, we happen to do earlier in the year because of some indicators that were there. So – and that’s why we did the write-off in the third quarter. With the Telco because of initiatives that we have in place right now, we have shown our projections and done our analysis that would suggest that we can sustain the goodwill that’s there.\\n\\nNow admittedly, if for whatever reason, these are initiatives and strategies that for whatever reason, they don’t work like we expect them to, then we will have to go in and remodify and redo. And then we, obviously every year, we go through that analysis. And if they don’t pan out the way we were thinking, then yes, we could have the impairment charges that would result. But that’s the analysis we went through. If we’re successful in these initiatives for which we think we will be, then the goodwill will be justified based on the results that we’ll see. So it’s not based….\\nSam Rebotsky\\nYes.\\nScott Francis\\n…on – certainly on past, but based on the future projections, right?\\nSam Rebotsky\\nYes. How much do you have to grow sales to eliminate this loss?\\nScott Francis\\nEliminate the loss on.\\nSam Rebotsky\\nOn the Telco?\\nScott Francis\\nWhat we – we don’t traditionally provide future guidance there, Sam. So we can’t – we’re not prepared to be able to provide that information to you. What I could tell you is that, you could take the margins that we have been generating at the Telco segment and extrapolate it out, and you can do that calculation, not trying to deflect, but we just don’t typically provide the guidance there to show that.\\nSam Rebotsky\\nAre our sales – how – what percentage are our sales increasing?\\nScott Francis\\nAgain, I’ll have to say the same thing. I can’t give forward guidance on that. We don’t traditionally do that. So…\\nSam Rebotsky\\nOkay. Say, the September quarter, what did the sales do over the prior September quarter – in the June quarter?\\nScott Francis\\nOkay. So as I said in our three months information, the Telco actually did slightly go down for the three months, and a lot of that was due to the disruption caused by our Palco move and at the Nave operation. So this last quarter was a probably a fair quarter to assess, and a lot of these initiatives we’re putting into place will be effective more in – probably more like in January, February, March timeframe forward.\\nSo that’s – it’s not on a historical basis. So that’s what we’re trying to do these various initiatives that Joe was discussing to then effectively be able to increase our top line revenue. But it will be a similar – many of these will be a similar margin and in terms of sales. To the extent, we get into new businesses like the repair, that could have different margins, but those are brand-new.\\nSam Rebotsky\\nDo we have any backlog that we can talk of?\\nScott Francis\\nJoe or Don, if you want to address that, you can.\\nJoseph Hart\\nYes. I mean, I would say that the Nave and Triton businesses aren’t so much about backlog. I mean, it’s based somewhat on inventory sales, as well as new product sales. But really, it’s a function of fulfilling orders that come in every day, every week of each quarter and not really a backlog like environment. Don, maybe you can add something there.\\nDon Kinison\\nNo, I think you’re correct. I mean, our month-over-month and quarter-over-quarter numbers as we forecast them are relative to what the business is doing at the current time. So in terms of having a funnel of expected deals that are coming in, we have a little bit of that, but that’s not necessarily how the business functions.\\nAs Scott spoke earlier and Joe focuses on continuing to grow the business and grow the relationships with our customers, while reducing operational efficiencies, overall helping the bottom line. And so far, we’re on track to do that and feel very comfortable in where we’re at in both of those businesses.\\nJoseph Hart\\nYes. And I would say that moving the Nave inventory and order fulfillment down to Palco really allows us to gain some major operational efficiency, reduce our operating costs and expand into some additional services like the test and repair, circuit boards and products that were previously manufactured by the OEMs.\\n\\nIn the case of Triton, it’s investing in some additional inventory, moving them out of cramped facilities that they’ve been in for their formative years into a facility that where we can add product lines and additional refurbishment services. So that’s what’s going on with those two operations.\\nIn the case of backlog, as we evolve into the wireless services here with the acquisition of Fulton and Mill City, that business has a better kind of backlog to it typically with sell-side services and infrastructure. Typically, your – what your backlogs running out about two months on average, sometimes three months of backlog, where you have orders that have been assigned to you and you’re just going to schedule them in over the coming eight to 12-week period. So it’s not typically large massive infrastructure or multi-year projects, it’s an ongoing business that matches up to the resources you have available.\\nOperator\\nWe’ll move to our next question follow-up from Michael Hess.\\nMichael Hess\\nThank you. I’ve got the line to ask a follow-up question. I’m not sure if you can answer this, given what you guys have just said. But I was wondering what color you could give on how the calendar fourth quarter has gone?\\nJoseph Hart\\nNo, it would be a combination of probably Scott and Don. So, Scott, do you want to go first?\\nScott Francis\\nWell – and I think, Michael, I think, again, we really don’t provide guidance. So we really can’t provide a lot of color there in terms of actual physical numbers. So just rest assured, we are trying to put these initiatives in the place. There’s a lot of moving parts right now and trying to make this growth initiative that we’re trying to put into place. But we just don’t – we don’t provide the forward looking at this point in time.\\nMichael Hess\\nOkay. Well, congratulations on the transaction, Scott.\\nScott Francis\\nI appreciate it very much, Michael.\\nJoseph Hart\\nThank you.\\nOperator\\nAnd that concludes today’s question-and-answer session. I’d like to turn the conference back to Joe Hart for any additional or closing remarks.\\nJoseph Hart\\nThank you, operator, and thank you to everyone who joined for the call today, and we really do appreciate your questions. We learn from them every time we get some. So thanks for that.\\nWe’re entering a transitional time here in the company’s development, as we executed against the growth strategy that we have in place. And we’re trying to further diversify the company into new verticals within the telecom industry. But we also are trying to reduce our operating costs and improve the way we do our business week in, week out and really build up our Telco operations.\\nWe’re encouraged by the progress we’ve made so far. We think we have a solid plan in place to drive forward our development over the next several months and in the coming year. And we think we can drive, both top line and bottom line growth, which is important to U.S. investors.\\nWe expect these plans together with our strategy to divest Cable TV and grow our Telco operations and to add the new wireless services will really allow us to take advantage of the coming market opportunity. So thanks for your participation in the call.\\nAnd with that, I’ll turn this back to the operator to close the session.\\nOperator\\nThank you. This concludes today’s call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.']}\n"

During this 10-year bull market, many investors have forgotten that investing only in equities can be quite risky. It has been too simple to just buy the SPY S&P 500 ETF and profit from rising valuations. This year-end 20% correction makes many investors reconsider safe haven assets like Gold and Treasuries. At Logical-Invest.com all of our core investment strategies are hedged. We experienced first hand the 50% drop in equities of 2008 and we like to protect our money from such large corrections. Applying a Hedge Strategy to Reduce Drawdown With this paper I want to show how a hedged strategy is constructed. We will use the Logical-Invest U.S. Market Strategy as an example. The U.S. Market Strategy is composed of a U.S. Market sub-strategy and a Hedge sub-strategy. The allocation between the two is updated monthly based on an algorithm, which finds the best allocation for a given lookback period. This allocation is then used for the coming month. A normal allocation would be for example 50% Equities and 50% Hedge. The maximum allocation to either the Hedge or Equity is 80%. The U.S. Market Sub-strategy  Instead of investing only in the SPY (S&P 500) or a similar ETF we designed a simple U.S. Market sub-strategy. The sub-strategy switches between SPY (S&P500), QQQ (Nasdaq 100), DIA (Dow 30) and SPLV (S&P 500 low volatility) ETFs depending on market conditions. All of these ETFs are liquid and have very small bid/ask spreads so switching between them is easy and cost efficient. In our backtests, the sub-strategy performed substantially better than a simple SPY investment. The average annual performance for the last 10 years was 18.4% compared to 12.7% for the SPY ETF. Switching to the defensive SPLV in times of increased market volatility has worked very well in the past.The chart below shows the 10-year performance, labeled as \"Strategy\", as compared with the SPY ETF. The colored columns on top show how the strategy switches between the four component ETFs.\\n \\n\\n The next chart shows the 2018 performance of the U.S. Market sub-strategy. The strategy invested in the low volatility S&P 500 ETF (SPLV) for extended periods of time, indicated by the red columns in the chart. You can see that in times of market trouble SPLV performs substantially better than SPY. \\n\\n However, as you can also see in the chart, even SPLV will drop in a market correction like the one in December. The best way to further minimize the impact of a correction is to add a hedge to the strategy. The Hedge Sub-strategy The Hedge sub-strategy is a very important part of all of our strategies. It switches between a Treasury Strategy and a GLD-USD Strategy depending on which one is performing better (using a 42 trading day lookback period). The following chart shows how the Hedge switches between the Treasury Strategy (NASDAQ:BLUE) and the GLD-USD Strategy (red). The combined performance of Hedge sub-strategy is represented by the black line labeled \"Strategy\". \\n\\n With an average performance of 12.5% per year, the strategy has been a good performer by itself. More importantly, it has no, or even negative, correlation to equity strategies. This makes it a good safe-haven for difficult market periods. In fact, you could use this strategy on its own, without adding any equity to it.\\n The strategy does not switch directly between GLD (Gold ETF) and TLT (Treasuries ETF) as it would not be able to exceed a 6% annual performance for a 10-year backtest. The reason is, that there have been long periods, where equity was performing really well and both Gold and Treasuries were under-performing. Adding a hedging strategy with poor performance can be quite a drag to the overall return of a strategy. We experienced this ourselves with an earlier strategy that used only TLT as a hedge. It is important to have alternative investments available to the hedging strategy beyond just GLD or TLT. For TLT we had already developed the Treasury strategy in the past which switches between TLT (iShares 20+ Year Treasury Bond ETF) and the inflation protected TIP (iShares TIPS Bond ETF).The chart below shows the return of the Treasury Hedge Strategy compared to TLT. With an annual performance of 6%, this strategy performs about twice as well as just the TLT with a 3% annual return. \\n\\n In the Gold Strategy we switch between GLD and UUP (US Dollar Index ETF). These two ETFs have a negative correlation to each other and also a very low correlation to equities. Looking back at the market corrections of the last 20 years, UUP often acted as a safe-haven ETF. At every correction, at least one of these two ETFs gained in value. The chart below shows the performance of the Gold Strategy in black in the bottom half. As you see in the allocation section above it, about half of the time this strategy was invested in the U.S. Dollar index (UUP) and was able to avoid most of Gold’s post 2011 decline. \\n\\n\\n Switching between these two sub-strategies (Gold and Treasury) resulted in quite a solid performance of the Hedge sub-strategy. Combining the U.S. Market and Hedge sub-strategies  Our QuantTrader software is used to allocate between the U.S. Market and Hedge sub-strategies with a maximum allocation 80% to either one. In the 11-year backtest chart below, you can see the 2008 correction on the left where the new strategy allocated the maximum 80% in the Hedge sub-strategy (red). Notice how most of the time the combined strategy maintains a substantial allocation in Hedge. It is rare for it to go “all-in” and allocate the max of 80% to equities, showing the benefit of hedging to building long term wealth. To determine the allocation to the two sub-strategies, we first calculate the Modified Sharpe Ratio for the past 172 days for every combination of the sub-strategies from 20%/80% to 80%/20%, then choose the best combination to use for the next month\\'s allocation. By using Modified Sharpe Ratio we favor low volatility over performance. In the 11-year chart below, you can see the allocation of Hedge (red) and U.S. Market (blue) on top half and the new combined strategy\\'s performance in the bottom half in black. The strategy did quite well during both the 2008 correction and this year\\'s correction. \\n\\n For December 2018, the strategy is 70% allocated in the Hedge sub-strategy and 30% in U.S. Market sub-strategy. As Hedge is currently invested in TLT and U.S. Market in SPLV we have had a very safe position through this correction. The 1-year chart below shows the combined strategy\\'s performance in black in the bottom half and its allocations to the sub-strategies in the upper half. \\n\\n\\n The combined strategy\\'s performance for the 11-year backtest is show below on the line labeled \"Strategy\". It is interesting to see that the Hedge sub-strategy outperformed the U.S. Market sub-strategy over this period. That is partly because it includes the 2008 market correction which was particularly hard on equities. \\n\\n The Hedged U.S. Market Strategy returns did quite well in the past, but just as important, its maximum drawdown was only 9.6% compared with 53% for the U.S. market in 2008. Finally, below is the 20-year backtest. The top section shows the performance of the two sub-strategies. The middle section shows the allocations to the combined strategy and the bottom graph shows the performance of the new Hedged U.S. Market strategy, labeled simply as \"Strategy\". \\n\\n The strategy worked well for the last 20 years and the hedge allocation was always increased early enough to prevent big drawdowns during all major market corrections. This gives the strategy a high probability that it should also work in the future. A daily updated chart with more metrics and details on the hedging allocations of this strategy can be found here USMarket Strategy Chart: \\n\\n\\n Frank GrossmannDecember 27, 2018\\nDisclosure: I am/we are long GLD, TLT, SPLV.

Safestyle was a really cheap stock that almost tripled in just three months after publication (see the article here). It is early to judge if the outcome was just pure luck or a very successful decision in terms of risk-reward. But, maybe it highlights the fact that AIM and the small cap space in the UK contains some mispriced securities that may present great opportunities. This time, I am writing about Laura Ashley (OTC:LARAF) as I am really impressed by the unbelievably low valuation, despite the enormous “hidden” value it holds as an iconic British designer and retailer of clothing and home furnishings. A first sign that shows how cheap the company is priced is the fact that the market capitalization of £24 million is just 0.09x times its revenue of £257 million. To be honest, most firms that have such a low price-to-sales ratio are occasionally risky, loss-making or without prospects. Typically, they are non-investable and don’t present investment opportunities. With Laura Ashley, there are indeed a lot of quantitative and qualitative factors that make the investment seem ugly, which causes investors to believe that the company belongs to the category described above.For example, the book value of the company is just £36.4 million. Then, the debt is high (£31.5 million) relative to book value, leading to a debt-to-equity ratio of 0.87x, a sign of a high leveraged company. Combining those with the fact that the balance sheet value is very small compared to the size of the operations, we come across a situation that negative net income margins could rapidly wipe out equity. That seems really frightening if we consider how sensitive the retail sector is and Laura Ashley’s FY 2018 negative statutory net margin of -0.5%. In addition, Laura Ashley has experienced stagnant growth in sales during the previous few years, and maybe it is perceived as a dying old brand. To top it all off, its stock is lately collapsing like those companies that finally go bankrupt.\\n However, in my all investing decisions, I try to take a step back, looking to discover the essentials and draw the big picture for the company. As a first step, I will make a short description of Laura Ashley’s profile and its stock market history, then highlight the enormous value not presented in the balance sheet. Next, I will describe different scenarios to approach a fair value for the stock. Then, I will comment more on the possible factors that make the stock so cheap and why the market may be wrong. Profile & History Laura Ashley PLC is an international lifestyle brand retailing furniture, home accessories, decorating and fashion products.The group has 161 retail stores in the UK, Ireland and France, franchise operations in 29 other countries and a number of licensing partners manufacturing products like kitchens, carpets, etc. The company until recently owned a hotel in the UK as well — the Laura Ashley The Manor Hotel. \\n\\n Laura Ashley’s style is characterized by Romantic English designs. (Source: Company’s FY 2018 Annual Report) The company went public two months after the tragic death of Laura Ashley in 1985, when she fell down the stairs of her daughter's home. \\n\\n Laura Ashley (Source: WalesOnline) During the IPO, 19.6 million shares were offered to public for 135p per share. The total number of shares after the transaction reached 200 million, valuing the company at around £270 million. According to UK CPI, this is equivalent to approximately 3x the amount in 2018 pounds.\\n \\n\\nThe enthusiasm during the 1985 IPO(Source: FY 2016 Annual Report) During and after the IPO, there was positive momentum because of Laura Ashley’s death. This helped keep the business successful for several years. However, the capital from the IPO and the enthusiasm fueled overexpansion that led to problems during the ’90s, especially for the North American operations. Different management teams with different strategies attempted to address the issues, and Laura Ashley was rescued in two periods (1991, 1999-2003) through the injection of new capital that diluted shareholders:  In 1991, the Japanese retailer Jusco (since rebranded as Aeon) invested £30 million and took a 15% stake by the issuance of 35 million shares at 85p per share. In 1998, MUI Group, controlled by the Malaysian businessman Khoo Kay Peng, invested £45 million for 159 million shares at 28p per share. Laura Ashley still needed more capital. In 1999, 199 million new shares were issued at 13p per share, and in 2003, 149 million more new shares at 6p per share.  Shareholders saw a large dilution in their holdings. The company had 200 million shares outstanding after its IPO in 1985 and has 728 million shares today. Every new issuance took place at lower and lower prices, and the company in total raised £109 million, excluding the £26 million from the IPO. Currently, Khoo Kay Peng and MUI collectively control 61% of Laura Ashley. They successfully rescued the company. Since FY 2004, that the company clearly turned around, it has produced earnings of 20.7p per share and returned 19.75p per share as dividends. Until lately, during most of 2017, it traded around 30p. \\n\\nLaura Ashley stock during the previous 5 years.(Source: londonstockexchange.com)\\n The Value of the Company The true value hiding behind Laura Ashley is its brand, which may be perceived by many as an old-fashioned and dying one. However, the fact is that despite its shrinking trend, it continues producing annually revenue of around £250 million for the company. This figure corresponds to even bigger “true” sales, as a large proportion of sales is franchise revenue. The company does not provide a like-for-like figure. We can have a rough estimation by assuming per-store revenue similar to the UK average. In this case, the brand power seems to be close to £500 million. Just online sales came in at £60 million in FY 2018. Also, it is very interesting that there is good diversification for the revenue, both geographically and in terms of different categories of products. \\n\\n Source: Company’s FY 2018 Annual Report Laura Ashley, despite its brand representing an engine capable of producing about half a billion pounds worth of sales, does not record this value in the balance sheet, and the company does have minimal intangible assets of £1.4 million. In addition, as classic a brand as Laura Ashley is, while it may be slowly fading, it is not like a trendy new brand that risks rapidly and completely going out of fashion. In fact, Laura Ashley could even see the opposite take place — a return to being an “in” fashion. This explains why MUI poured millions of pounds to save the company 20 years ago, when it was in worse shape than today, with £39 million of debt in FY 1998. The issuance of stock during the 1998-2003 period cost new investors about £80 million. Those shares represent about a 70% stake in the company today. It shows that during a very troubled period for the company, investors found that it was worth paying an amount that corresponds to about a £35 million value for the 30% stake of the former shareholders. This is a guide for the value that current shareholders could realize, even if Laura Ashley needed to be rescued again.\\n After its turnaround, since FY 2004, Laura Ashley has produced an accumulated net income of £142 million, which is approximately equal to its distributed dividends. During FY 2011-2016, the yearly net income was between £13 million and £19.3 million. Keeping in mind the above, it really is shocking that the market capitalization of the company is just £24 million. The 3 Valuation Scenarios The good scenario: The company survives as it is, without the need of raising new capital, and continues to produce a net margin comparable to what it has achieved during the previous 15 years. Applying this net margin (3.4%) to current sales of £257 million, the earning power of the company comes in at £8.8 million, and by assuming a 12.5x earning multiple, the corresponding value of the company comes in at £110 million. In this scenario, the resulting value above is commensurate with a broad range of possible positive outcomes, and it is like an average of those.I assume the positive scenario as the most probable outcome and give it a probability of 50%. The bad scenario: The company realizes losses and accumulates debt, finally leading to a bailout similar to what we saw about 20 years ago. Having in mind the huge value of the brand and the past MUI rescue, I assume that in such a hypothetical event, current shareholders would be able to save a value of around £35 million.To be conservative, I assume a quite large possibility — 30% — for this scenario The “black swan” scenario: I really can't imagine any scenario where no investor or other acquirer will appreciate Laura Ashley’s brand and its half-billion revenue power and let the company disappear. However, there might be factors and risks beyond my understanding that could lead the company to bankruptcy in a way that leaves nothing for current shareholders. Again, to be very cautious, I assign a 20% possibility to a scenario that seems very unlikely. The EMV (Expected Monetary Value) for the three scenarios is calculated at £64 million, or 8.8p per share, giving an upside potential of 167% for the stock. Under my assumptions, there is a huge upside potential (359%) under the good scenario, more than value protection under a bad scenario — 25% upside — and a limited probability of permanent loss under the “black swan” scenario.\\n The true value of the company may be even higher, but I prefer to be very conservative with my assumptions. The goal for a value investor is not to find an accurate value, but to assure that there is much to gain and little to lose after applying very conservative estimations. Possible Reasons for Undervaluation While we have to be brave and ready to challenge market beliefs, it adds to our confidence and to our chances of being right by discovering what the market misunderstands or why it overreacts. We have to be independent thinkers but also respectful to other people beliefs. So, it always pays to examine those factors. Low book value The company has a very low book value of £36 million. But as previously explained, this is very misleading as it does not include the brand value, something intangible but with innate power to lead sales and earnings, as well as add to the liquidation value of the company. It is not an easy and safe process to estimate a value for the brand, but with what we saw in the valuation sections, we can derive that the brand value is far above the other items that are calculated in the balance sheet. This low book value drastically affects figures like those three below, making them seem ugly and leading investors to erroneously think the undervaluation is justified.  The book value is very low compared to sales and future possible losses. It is very low compared to the debt, which according to the FY 2018 annual report was £31.5 million. The book value is not much lower than the market capitalization. So, price-to-book is 0.66x, not impressively cheap for a troubled firm.  A mechanical process through a screener based on the above multiples would show a risky company and would not highlight it as one that trades at an extreme discount. However, if we adjusted the book value by adding the brand value, the above metrics would show how discounted the stock price truly is. The Singapore property Laura Ashley lately sold its Singapore property for £30.3 million and has already registered an impairment charge of £4.7 million in FY 2018 results, because the carrying value of the property was higher on the balance sheet. The company bought the property in 2015, and in hindsight, many may question the scope and reasoning of this move, reasoning that it just financially harmed the company. It is awkward for a fashion company to accumulate debt to invest so heavily to real estate.\\n However, in the end, Laura Ashley made the right decision because selling the property leads to a safer balance sheet. The fantastic news here is that the company must be already net debt free, and by the new financial year it won’t have to pay interest of about £1.3 million. Investors that do not closely follow the company will see the debt-free balance sheet after the announcement of the FY 2019 half-year results on February. As I explained earlier, investors may overestimate the size and significance of the debt by comparing it with the misleading equity value. Now, anyway, the debt is gone! Furthermore, just a few days ago, the company announced the sale of its Laura Ashley Hotel on 31 January 2019. It will continue to expand into the hospitality sector, but under license and franchise. Hopefully, these two moves mean it is moving away from real estate investments. The loss FY 2018 ended in a loss of -£1.4 million, compared to a net profit of £4.0 million in FY 2017. The market can harshly punish a loss-making firm because if it does not manage to turn around the situation, losses lead to equity hemorrhage that occasionally ends in bankruptcy. In addition, the absence of profits hide the potential value and its cheapness. For example, if the company had a low profit of just £4.0 million, like in FY 2017, with the current market capitalization of £24 million, the P/E ratio would be just 6.0x! Again, I believe the market overreacts to the losses. The loss of FY 2018 is the result of exceptional items totaling £5.6 million — £4.7 million of which is related to the Singapore property impairment. The profit before tax and exceptional items is positive at £5.6 million, showing that the underlying performance is not so bad. According the analyst consensus, the estimated forward EPS for FY 2019 is 0.70p. If it comes true, it leads to a P/E ratio of 4.7x. Suspension of dividend The company paid dividends of 2.5p per share during FY 2016 and just 0.5p per share during FY 2017. But, during FY 2018, it did not pay any dividend, and it did not recommend any payment during this FY. Some traditional long-term investors give too much importance to the dividend. They can afford their stock going south if they still receive cash, but they panic if they see that their investment has nothing to offer them anymore.\\n It is important indeed for a firm to distribute cash to the shareholders; however, investors should not care only about what is happening on the surface. Sometimes, it is wise for a company that faces difficulties to suspend its dividend and focus on survival. Laura Ashley may re-initiate a dividend when profits stabilize. Just a 0.5p dividend per share would lead to a dividend yield of 15%. For me, a dividend suspension is one of the best reasons for a stock to stay undervalued. The absence of a dividend does not help a quick price recovery towards a stock’s intrinsic value, but it explains why the short-sighted market doesn’t recognize this value and punishes the stock. This is what a patient long-term value investor should search for: Value hidden under the surface. UK, Brexit, Pound and Retail Industry problems Brexit is an ongoing story that has already started affecting the British economy, consumer confidence, the currency and investors’ moods. In addition, the retail sector is globally facing the e-commerce disruption that has led a lot of brick-and-mortar firms to losses and bankruptcy. By putting those two together, we come to a very difficult period for the UK retail sector. Many UK retailers made announcements regarding poor store sales during Black Friday and the beginning of the Christmas period. The weakening pound is a force that boosts export-driven companies and hurts firms like Laura Ashley, which imports two-thirds of its products from the Far East and Europe. A 1% depreciation of the sterling against the euro and US dollar can reduce profits by about £1.1 million. What I like, however, is that the difficulties derive from an overall systemic (Brexit, retail) and not a company-specific problem. Those kind of situations more commonly reverse themselves than company-specific problems that usually lead to bankruptcy. Great returns can come by buying industries or economies in trouble. UK retail combines both. I would like to explain a little more about the retail industry. I agree that e-commerce and Amazon will continue growing at the expense of brick-and-mortar stores. A lot of firms will go bankrupt or see their sales shrink. However, physical stores won’t disappear and will still be valuable in an omni-channel environment. The smaller “physical pie” will be shared by fewer firms and stores in a way that they can survive by getting larger shares. The turnaround of the sector could be triggered by more and more weak players exiting the industry. That would mean less competition, lower rents (due to retail real estate crisis) and lower costs on other inputs. Similarly, the success of online sales would result in more expensive digital ads and other channels of online sales. Sooner or later, there will be an equilibrium that allows the strongest to survive and return to strong profitability.\\n In my opinion, there are three basic factors that can judge the survivors: The financial, for firms with higher margins and stronger balance sheets; the online penetration, for firms with a high percentage of online sales; and a moat, in most cases for firms that own a valuable brand. For Laura Ashley, the balance sheet is strong, especially after the sale of the Singapore property, and the underlying profit margin is still positive. Then, FY 2018 online sales of £60 million represent 25% of the retail revenue. It is impressive that online sales alone are 2.5x times the market capitalization of the firm. Finally, I believe that the new digital era favors brands like Laura Ashley, because it limits the importance of the intermediaries. The firm can have a direct relationship with its customer base with a minimal structure that helps costs. The Malaysian Management and Ownership Investors can be very suspicious when management comes from a country where the corporate governance is not so developed. Fair or not, investors tend to fear a possible feud or a lack of respect for the minority shareholders. They would feel safer with “domestic” management that is more familiar to them. However, management under Khoo Kay Peng has proved its ability to turn around the company. Also, as we saw earlier, it produced massive amounts of earnings that all were distributed as dividends to the shareholders. The lack of confidence with the current ownership and management may be unfair. Finally, there is some speculation that the very low valuation could be linked to the divorce battle between Khoo Kay Peng and his former wife, Miss Malaysia 1969. The court ruled that she should walk away with a £64 million financial package, based on the marital asset kitty of £160 million. The less the value of Laura Ashley, the less he should pay to his ex-wife. There is no evidence that Khoo Kay Peng orchestrated the collapse of the stock. For example, somebody might suspect that he might have done that by using the Singapore property impairment charge.\\n Closing stores and the “dying brand” It is true that the brand is not as powerful as it used to be some decades ago. Also, it is targeting a generation and a consumer age group that will continue to reduce. In addition, due to the retail sector’s problems that we discussed above, the firm is closing stores. It recently announced that it will close 40 of its 160 stores in the UK, while its Australian franchisee with 18 stores enters administration. Those realities and the related negative news circulating draw a very bleak picture around Laura Ashley’s name. They can affect the psychology of the investors, but they do not change the facts about the undervaluation of the stock, as was showcased earlier in the valuation. Also, I reiterate my reasoning that a classic brand like Laura Ashley is unlikely to go rapidly out of fashion. For me it is positive that we have one more factor — the “dying brand” — that makes this investing story so “ugly.” Throwing bad after good money and the “falling knife” The company raised capital during the IPO and the two rescue attempts. The new stock was issued every time at lower and lower prices. The last issuance was at 6p per share in 2003, from 135p per share during the IPO in 1985. Currently, the stock trades even lower at 3.31p, hinting that Laura Ashley’s stock issuances have always been a case of throwing good money after bad. However, this is not true if we calculate the dividends of 19.75p that the company has distributed to shareholders since FY 2004. Then anyway, investors have the bad habit to judge their investment decision according to how the market prices their stocks. So, they tend to believe that they were wrong whenever a stock is collapsing, thinking that its value is less than they thought. Similarly, the stock is down 91% from its 2015 peak of 35p, indicating a “falling knife.” Most investors are very fearful to deal with such stocks. However, I think that this is a very good reason for the stock to be cheap and I believe that value investors must be able to deal with these situations. One of our jobs is to catch the “falling knives” that the short-sighted investors can’t.\\n Catalyst I can think of many potential events that could act as catalysts for the stock to return closer to its fair value. A few examples include a tender offer from MUI or another company, the return to profitability, or the re-initiation of a dividend. Each might have a huge impact on the stock, but these are potential events. What I consider as a catalyst is the publishing of the FY 2019 half-year results in February 2019. The company is expected to be net debt free, so it is going to appear on more mechanical screens that demand low debt. It is going to receive more attention from value investors who follow a mechanical process. From a quantitative prospective, the balance sheet will go from leveraged to very safe. This can change a lot for a stock that has been badly hit. The effect can be even more strong if the company does not disappoint in terms of profitability. Conclusion The true value hiding behind Laura Ashley is its brand, capable of producing about half a billion pounds in sales. At current market capitalization of just £24 million, the stock seems to offer a great upside potential with a low downside risk. This does not mean that the stock can not go further south, but it means that, according my assumptions, it is not likely to be worth much less. So, for long-term investors, there is a limited risk of permanent loss, while the EMV of the three scenarios — calculated at £64 million or 8.8p per share — offers a great upside potential of 167% for the stock. There are many reasons that explain why the market is punishing this stock so heavily: The misleading equity value, the impairment of the Singapore property, the FY 2018 loss, the suspension of the dividend, the weakening sterling and the Brexit fears, the retail sector crisis, the foreign management and ownership, the “dying brand,” the closing stores and the “falling knife” effect. All of these factors combine to create so ugly a story that many might ask, “Who is gonna buy such a stock?” The fantastic news is that all those factors have been taken into consideration in making the scenarios and calculation of the EMV, and the stock is still offered at an unbelievable discount. In addition, the announcement of the FY 2019 half year results in February may act as a catalyst for a quick appreciation of the stock.\\n Laura Ashley at 3.31p is like a piece of gold fully covered by mud. Those who care about how it looks, they can sell it for just £24 million of capitalization. I care about its true value and I will be a buyer, hoping that I am not wrong with my assumptions.

Unlike many competitors, this company manages to sell its production in far more profitable markets than the AECO spot market. The company also has exceptionally low production costs even by Canadian standards. Yet Mr. Market could care less and has trashed the stock price along with the rest of the Canadian energy producing industry. That market attitude though has created a buying opportunity that seldom has existed in the past for this quality Canadian issue. \\n\\n Source: Seeking Alpha Website December 27, 2018 As shown above, this stock has taken a very steep dive off the proverbial cliff. An observer would be expecting large losses and a dividend cut from price action like this. Yet nothing could be further from reality than that perception. ARC Resources is one of the healthier Canadian gas producers. Currently, cash flow appears to be exceeding long term debt. (Canadian Dollars Unless Otherwise Stated) \\n\\n \\n\\n\\n Source: ARC Resources Third Quarter, 2018, Earnings Report Net debt as defined by the company currently totals in excess of C$650 million. However, cash flow is projected at more than C$800 million for the year. Funds flow from operations appears to be well on its way to growing about 20% from the previous fiscal year despite all the well published Canadian obstacles. The margins shown above are generous for a gas producer. Not many companies report that two-thirds of the selling price gets to the operating netback even with help from the commodity gains. The margin has increased nicely from the previous fiscal year. The result is one of the better balance sheets in the industry. \\n\\n Source: ARC Resources December, 2018, Investor Presentation Much of the financial progress is due to the exceptional returns delivered by the various leasing areas in the company portfolio. The rates of return generally allow for a very fast cash build. The result is that the stock value of the company generally resides in the C$2.5 billion range. When the roughly C$850 million of long term debt is added to that stock value, the enterprise value appears to be about C$3.4 billion. That enterprise value is only about 4 times projected cash flow for the current fiscal year. The stock is even cheaper if the net debt figure above is used. Arc Resources management plans to grow production about 10% per year, so that enterprise value-to-cash flow from operations ratio will contract in the future if the current stock price levels persist. When that growth is combined with a dividend that currently exceeds 7%, this potential investment offers that rare return of a generous distribution as well as capital gains potential.\\n An annual return of at least 16% appears assured even if the stock price never recovers to previous levels. The low break-even levels given above for the various projects assure this company a growth pattern during times of extreme and sustained industry downturns. The agility of management necessary to assure access to continued strong pricing markets is another key management trait constantly exhibited. Additionally, management announced a preliminary 2019 budget of C$775 million. That budget predicts additional production growth. Management did sell some non-core properties this fiscal year. That could potentially make positive comparisons remote until an investor adjusts for the non-core sales. Management intends to grow production about 10% per fiscal year. Oil production is expected to decrease next year due to the absence of the sold Redwater properties. Conclusion The company has made good cash flow progress despite selling non-core assets over the past several quarters. Funds from operations per share have so far tracked about 20% above the previous fiscal year. Second quarter will usually be sequentially down because of the Canadian spring breakup. The plan to grow about 10% per fiscal year appears easily within reach. This company has overcome many current Canadian obstacles. \\n\\n Source: ARC Resources Third Quarter, 2018, Earnings Report Capital expenditures have not slowed due to the takeaway constraints in Canada. Even as the stock price has declined as the news has sighted one industry headache after another, this company has continued to move ahead. Finances are in great shape with a credit line in excess of C$1 billion unused. As competitors succumb to the current low Canadian pricing, this company will be very able to probably manage a distressed purchase or two for cash. This gives the company an advantage over the many consolidators that pay for mergers with company stock.\\n Light crude and certain condensate pricing has remained strong in Canada even with the transportation issues. Many of the headlines have disproportionately affected heavy oil producers and gas producers relying upon the spot pricing of AECO (which really has been awful). This company has managed to avoid both of those key issues. One could never tell that accomplishment from the stock price action. Well run companies like ARC Resources often become takeover targets if they remain cheap for too long. No matter how depressed the Canadian market gets, this company is very cheap compared to many competitors. In fact, the stock price could probably double from current levels and remain cheap when compared to the growing cash flow. \\n\\n Source: ARC Resources November, 2018, Budget Press Release The company has been selling non-core properties for the last few years. This has enabled management to trim some key costs. Operating costs, for example, could drop as much as 20% next year. On the other hand, the key oil production will drop due to the sale of non-core production. Condensate production should rise in the fourth quarter as some new production comes online. The largest component, the gas production is targeted to grow 10% per year for the foreseeable future. That is some excellent news for shareholders. A company that can profitably grow production during challenging Canadian industry conditions (like the present) is a company worth investigating thoroughly. ARC Resources has a lot of good solid characteristics. Cash flow is very strong for the amount of assets employed and production should grow for the next five years at least. The low breakeven of many of its leasing areas assure the company of reasonable cash flow even during times of oil and gas pricing downturns.\\n The key investment theme is that Mr. Market put the stock in the doghouse without regard to all the financial progress this company made this year. Sooner or later the market will re-evaluate this stock far more favorably or the company will receive a takeover offer. Either way a current position in the stock should reward shareholders.

In fact, there's a chance that after kicking the can, its management grows more relaxed about the company's performance.\"], 'article': ['Shareholders of Frontier Communications (FTR) have had a harrowing past year and a half. The telecom stalwart has been losing subscribers at an alarming pace and the company as a whole is yet to start showing signs of a turnaround. With its shares down by about 70% in value over the past 7 months, down to about the $2-mark on a per share basis due to their deteriorating financials, there is reason to believe that Frontier\\'s board would push for a yet another reverse stock split over the next quarter or two. \\n\\n (Source: Bigstockphoto, Image license purchased by author) Why Is It Coming? Let me start by saying that this wouldn\\'t be the first time that Frontier Communications would undergo a reverse stock split. The telecom stalwart actually executed a 1-for-15 reverse stock split only last year. The whole idea of this activity is to reduce a company\\'s share count by a predetermined factor, which artificially boosts the share price by the same proportion along the way. One might ask what\\'s the benefit in artificially boosting the share price in the first place? Well, there are a few reasons actually. First, stock exchanges tend to have their own set of listing requirements which includes a minimum daily share price. Frontier Communications is listed on Nasdaq, which too, has its own set of listing and delisting related criteria. For instance, it requires a minimum bid price to be above $1 per share.\\n If a company trades for 30 consecutive business days below the $1.00 minimum closing bid price requirement, Nasdaq will send a deficiency notice to the company, advising that it has been afforded a \"compliance period\" of 180 calendar days to regain compliance with the applicable requirements... In order to regain compliance with the minimum bid price requirement, a security must have a closing bid price of $1.00 or more for 10 consecutive business days. The problem here is that Frontier\\'s shares are hovering near the $2-mark which isn\\'t too far away from the dreaded $1-mark. The company doesn\\'t have to wait for its shares to hit $1 to kickstart the reverse split procedure. To put things in perspective, when Frontier Communications originally proposed its 1-for-15 reverse stock split in March 2017, its shares were trading around the $2.5-mark on a pre-split basis. \\n\\nFTR data by YCharts Proposing and executing a reverse stock split can take several months to materialize. Not to mention, the whole split can be derailed if its shareholders vote against it. So, it makes sense to proactively propose the split than to wait for its shares to hit $1, or to wait for Nasdaq to serve a delisting notice. Besides, healthy companies try to avoid earning the reputation of penny stocks as this category tends to attract a lot of speculative trading volume. This brings in a lot of unwanted volatility in the stocks of relatively stable companies, which is a trigger for conservative investors (retail or institutional) to sell out and look elsewhere for stocks that have relatively lower betas. Not to mention, brokerages and rating agencies tend to stop covering companies falling in this category as due to the heightened volatility. Frontier\\'s management actually used this rationale in their reverse stock split proposal, pitched to its investors last year. From the document:\\n ...the Board of Directors believes that some institutional investors and investment funds may be reluctant to invest, and in some cases may be prohibited by their investing guidelines from investing in lower priced stocks, and that brokerage firms may be reluctant to recommend lower-priced stocks to their retail clients. The reverse stock split could increase our trading price to a level that would be viewed more favorably by potential investors. Further, brokerage commissions, as a percentage of the total transaction, tend to be higher for lower-priced stocks. As a result, certain investors may also be dissuaded from purchasing lower-priced stock. A higher stock price after the reverse stock split may reduce this concern. As Frontier\\'s shares are hovering close to the $2-mark, I believe that its board will propose another reverse stock split over the next 3 to 6 months to avoid the above-mentioned repercussions and risk-factors. But then the question arises: What does it mean for Frontier\\'s shareholders and how will it impact its share price? The Impact On the surface, a reverse stock split only artificially boosts a company\\'s stock price once its existing shares are retired by a predetermined ratio. Also, it doesn\\'t have any impact on the company\\'s operating or financial performance whatsoever, and it wouldn\\'t single-handedly arrest the decline in its shares. Actually, it may appear as a no-news if you look at it from a 10,000-foot view. So, what\\'s all this for? For starters, it would make Frontier Communications compliant with Nasdaq\\'s listing requirements, avoid its shares falling in the penny stock category, and prevent it from being dropped by brokerages, institutions, and research firms. So, while the reverse stock split won\\'t solve any of Frontier\\'s problems, it would delay them, which is something like kicking the can down the road. That would essentially give its management more time to rebuild or destroy their business, depending on how you feel about their top-brass.\\n As far as I\\'m concerned, I\\'ve discussed time and again in my past articles how Frontier\\'s management has a lax attitude and how they keep missing their own guidance. So, I\\'m of the opinion that undergoing a reverse stock split would make Frontier\\'s management even more negligent, something that can potentially lead to continued destruction of the company\\'s subscriber base in addition to its sales figures. \\n\\n (Source: BQ\\'s Broadband Tracker) Just to rehash a bit here, I had noted in one of my past articles when Frontier carried out its 1-for-15 reverse stock split last year: \"...the reverse stock split would take away some of Frontier\\'s short-term problems (NASDAQ compliance, maintain liquidity in stock etc.). However, it doesn\\'t change the fact that Frontier needs to address its operational issues that have been causing its subscribers to abandon ship. I see this reverse stock split as a negative development and based on the empirical evidence that we\\'ve gathered, I\\'m of the opinion that Frontier shares haven\\'t bottomed out yet.\" Frontier\\'s shares have plunged by about 86% since I wrote that report. But this wasn\\'t unexpected. I studied the stock performance of over 550 companies that underwent stock splits between 1998 and 2017-end. About 60% of the companies saw their share prices decline exactly 1 year after their reverse stock splits; I\\'ve attached a chart below to illustrate the results of my findings. Going by this statistical evidence, it\\'s more likely that Frontier\\'s shares would trend lower if it carried out another reverse stock split. \\n\\n\\n (Data from MarketXLS, compiled by Author) Investors Takeaway Given how Frontier\\'s shares are trending downwards and gradually approaching the $1-mark on a per share basis, I believe the company would propose to carry out a yet another reverse stock split over the coming few months. It\\'ll make Frontier compliant with Nasdaq\\'s listing norms, prevent it from falling in the penny stock category, and partly ensure that brokerages, research firms, and rating agencies don\\'t drop their coverage on the name. However, it won\\'t solve any of Frontier\\'s operational or financial problems - such as subscriber base erosion or missing guidance time and again - and its shares could continue to head downwards during 2019, at least until the company starts showing signs of turning things around.\\nDisclosure: I/we have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

Major shareholders are going to hold management accountable for the share price no matter what.The discount to NAV is now pretty clear and concrete. Executives are going to get pushed to unlock value via asset sale or buybacks.'], 'article': ['Front Yard Residential (RESI) shareholders have been left scratching their heads over the recent price action, especially as management execution has been right in line with expectations this year. After all, we\\'ve seen solid execution on many fronts: the steady march towards funds from operations covering the dividend, refinancing to save significant capital, raising debt through the Freddie Mac pilot program, amending property management agreements, and of course the purchase of HavenBrook to add 3,200 properties to the balance sheet while also internalizing property management. So why the sell-off? I\\'ll get into that, as well as the obstacles management faces against a very vocal and active shareholder base that has grown increasingly frustrated. As a (relatively) smaller shareholder, I don\\'t need to pick a side between the likely upcoming showdown between management and major holders of the common stock. Neither do most readers. In fact, I view this conflict as a \"heads I win, tails I win\" scenario. I\\'ve been behind CEO George Ellison since day one when I bought my first lot of shares in this REIT. I want to see this management team succeed. Winding the clock forward a couple of years, I think the share price will be materially higher than here as those aspirations come to fruition. With that said, other shareholders might not have the patience to get there. With the share price currently well below true net asset value, I think it is highly likely we see shareholder activism or multiple bids for these assets. While that could impair the long-term story of Front Yard Residential, an asset sale or buyback is likely to drive share prices materially higher. Even with the lull in the housing market, single-family residential real estate remains a hot asset class. There are numerous potential buyers, making this one of my top ideas for 2019 on the long side.\\n What Drove The Sell-Off Putnam, through its Putnam Capital Spectrum Fund (PVSAX), was a major mutual fund holder that owned 5.3mm shares. This was no small stake and represented nearly 10% of the float outstanding. Managed by Jacquelyne Cavanaugh, the fund has had an awful year, down 14.4% to date. Assets under management (\"AUM\") declines have been enormous, collapsing 30%, or more than $500mm this year, as investors have pulled out capital in response to weak performance. As a result of redemptions from mutual fund holders, Putnam liquidated its entire stake in Front Yard Residential in the month of October after quarterly 13-F filings were submitted, off-loading those shares in blocks to investment bank broker dealers. Market makers have been working through that inventory, with selling now mostly done in my opinion. So why choose Front Yard Residential to liquidate if the story is so great? Putnam Capital Spectrum is a highly concentrated fund: its top three holdings (Dish Network (DISH), Jazz Pharmaceuticals (JAZZ), and EchoStar (SATS)) comprised 65% of the managed portfolio. See the below that was as of the last filing data: \\n\\n *Source: Mutualfunds.com based on quarterly fund SEC filings These three positions are, for a variety of reasons, massive bets that the manager just did not want to unwind. All of us have conviction bets that we like more than others - Front Yard Residential, by comparison, was a small stake (3.5% of AUM) that this mutual fund either felt that it did not have as much opportunity as its other holdings or it would just reflect poorly on management to capitulate on its big stakes. This is forced capitulation from a major holder in a name with relatively low liquidity. Front Yard Residential trades 750,000 shares daily; a non-inconsequential amount of volume over the past forty-five days has been from this constant barrage of selling, likely further pushed down by traders capitalizing on the negative momentum. The timing is unfortunate for longs, but it represents massive opportunity or small investors to benefit from a supply/demand imbalance caused by major institutional holders.\\n Net Asset Valuation I just want to reinforce how concrete the net asset valuation aspect here is because it is incredibly important to this story. It has been a pain point for me in public discussions with other researchers on this firm that, quite frankly, just do not seem to get the underlying macro in the markets Front Yard Residential serves, going as far to call out management as putting out bogus numbers from an \"unnamed\" third party. During the Q3 conference call, CFO Robin Lowe put a name on that firm: Duff and Phelps, a well-known advisor on valuation and mergers and acquisitions on Wall Street. Regardless of third-party valuation, I also want to use Front Yard Residential\\'s own data to back into the NAV story. In Q3, the company provided both its net investment in real estate (purchase price plus renovation costs) and the levels of home price appreciation. The home price appreciation data is pulled directly from the Federal Housing Finance Agency from their quarterly, non-seasonally-adjusted transactions index. This is government data. Investors can find this on Slide 19 and Slide 20 in the company\\'s most recent earnings presentation (Source). Using both datasets, investors can back into the return on each dollar invested in the metro assuming properties are broadly representative of the underlying property pool. Those figures back into the below: \\n\\n That is a heck of a lot of numbers, but the takeaway point is that overall asset value points to $2,813mm before backing out sustaining capital expenditures. I used 2.5% annual as a baseline, backing into $104mm. This brings overall liquidation value to $2,709mm of the property pool. The company held $163mm in other assets at the end of Q3 (cash, accounts receivable, prepaid expenses, NPLs), bringing total assets to $2,872mm. Less $1,697mm in repurchase and loan agreements and $87mm in other liabilities, total net asset value stands at $1,088mm or $19.96/share. Bolstering this outlook, JP Morgan recently reiterated the firm as their Top Idea following Q3 2018 earnings, in part based on their own net asset value calculation using 5.3% cap rates and an assumed 65% NOI margin.\\n \\n\\n *Source: November 2018 JP Morgan Research Report There are some caveats to the JP Morgan valuation model that investors might point out. One, this assumes 100% occupancy which I imagine is an orange flag for some: mid 90% occupancy is much more a reflection of reality (94% stabilized rental in Q3, targeting 96% next year). However, understand that the thought process here because just because a property is vacant does not mean it should be excluded (implies worthlessness of the asset). 65% NOI margin also appears to be another lofty target given Front Yard Residential reported 62.8% NOI margin in Q3. This represents expansion (albeit returns to recent normalized levels). However, management laid out some goals for 2019 that should drive NOI higher and what might make this NOI margin too low of an estimate. Due to the internalization of property management, more operating leverage, the company handling repair and maintenance and property turnover, and stricter vendor and supply management, management targeted \"about\" 66% NOI margin on its 2019 guidance (Source: Front Yard Residential Q3 2018 Earnings Presentation, Slide 7). While this is above the peer group (American Homes 4 Rent (AMH), Invitation Homes (INVH)) this comes down to the lower turnover in tenants, relatively less HOA properties, and generally more favorable terms on real estate taxes. An even more cautious take - 5.3% cap rate on existing properties generating $124mm in fiscal 2019 NOI adjusted for capex - points to $2,339mm in asset valuation (before REOs and NPLs), which drives a valuation of $16.00/share. This has been my predominant operating conclusion and is the one I\\'ve been using for quite some time in establishing a very conservative $16.00/share price target on Front Yard Residential. So in summary on net asset value, we have:\\n  Duff and Phelps stating NAV is between $16-20.00/share based on a variety of cap rate assumptions. Investment banks (JPMorgan above but I\\'ve also seen Credit Suisse research) pointing to NA between $18-21.00/share. FHFA Data combined with quarterly capital allocations (not based on cap rate) points to $20.00/share in NAV. A very cautious take based on just realized NOI next year pointing to $16.00/share in NAV.  In my opinion, whether stated NAV is valid should not be a real discussion anymore given the property price appreciation trends across most company markets. This is cut and dry. What isn\\'t is what management will do to realize that value and an honest discussion on why FFO per share metrics are so low from an efficiency perspective. Shareholder Activism? With strong evidence of a discount to NAV existing, the market will likely force that closed. Some sort of deal-making activity just becomes more alluring for outsiders as the company continues to clean up its structure, hopefully culminating with the elimination of the AAMC management fee - something management has stated is a major discussion point heading into next year. While the company could sell homes and buy back shares - something most major shareholders are also pushing management on - Front Yard Residential could end up receiving takeover offers. There are a variety of potential buyers out there:   Pretium Partners raised $1,000mm in July; it already owns north of 26,000 homes. It is the third largest single-family landlord behind publicly-traded companies Invitation Homes and American Homes 4 Rent. Both of the above publicly-traded peers trade at a less steep discount to net asset value; the sell-side estimates ~15%. I think both parties could raise a mix of cash and stock and fund a buyout of Front Yard Residential accretively.  Amherst has recently raised capital for a single-family fund for more purchases; it too owns more than 20,000 homes. The Teacher Retirement System of Texas and Singapore\\'s GIC announced a joint venture with Tricon Capital to purchase up to 12,000 homes, each pledging $250mm. \\n Given the drop in the share price, particularly after strong Q2 and Q3 earnings releases, management is under intense pressure to show results next year. I think sell-side expectations are reasonable, are not priced into the stock currently, and the share price is likely to move materially higher on its own. However, many shareholders want a quick fix: that means selling homes to buy back stock (improving NAV per share) or just outright selling the assets. I can say with solid certainty that the team heading Front Yard Residential has absolutely no interest in buying back stock. In their view, this would reduce operating scale and leverage just as the firm was bordering on the edge of really being able to take advantage of scale. In fact, I\\'d say the goal is the opposite: selling higher valued properties or assets in non-core markets in order to rotate capital into lower priced homes within their top 10 MSAs. The Q3 stated goal was to exit next year with north of 16,000 homes, good enough to get the core FFO number into the $1.00/share run-rate range. The number one weakness to point towards with Front Yard Residential has always been the high FFO multiple versus peers (due to inefficiencies between generating FFO per dollar of NAV) and the lack of coverage on the dividend keeping value investors away. Hitting that 2019 exit guidance solves all of those problems and eliminates the last issues bears can hang their hats on. Takeaway I\\'d be shocked to see management not have to deal with shareholder frustration in a more public fashion next year. That could range from public press releases to pressure on the Board to even more concentration of shares in the top hands involved. I\\'d also be shocked to not see some bidding rumors begin to swirl. It\\'s a tough situation to be in, particularly since both approaches have their pros and cons. However, in either case, the value is pretty clearly there. By the end of 2019, Front Yard Residential will exit the year on a 9x FFO multiple if all goes to plan; peers trade at 16-17x. If the value of the common equity does not move, it will continue to trade at half the rate that a private party would have to pay to build equivalent assets despite the fact that comps like Silver Bay were purchased at a premium to NAV and more than 23x FFO. That\\'s a big opportunity for a buyout. If activism succeeds, then the company will be selling homes and buying back stock at pennies on the dollar - or perhaps sold outright in the mid to high teens per share. In any of these cases, buyers of the common stock today come out well ahead.\\n\\nNote: Members of the Industrial Insights community receive access to actionable research ideas like this often.

AMPYRA generated ~$153M in sales during Q3, but with generics grabbing the lion\\'s share of the market, we can expect dismal AMPYRA sales in the upcoming quarters. However, the company just had a last minute victory with an FDA approval for their Parkinson\\'s disease \"PD\" product INBRIJA. The company believes INBRIJA could eventually generate up to $800 million in peak sales. Unfortunately, many analysts are not as optimistic as the company and are issuing price cuts left and right. Although I do see INBRIJA becoming a strong product for the company, the initial sales will not offset the expected loss in revenue from AMPYRA. In addition, I expect competition to eventually cut into INBRIJA\\'s peak sales. In light of that, I have opted to sit on the sidelines for the near term, but I am bullish on the long-term outlook for the company. I expect 2019 to provide a great entry point for the stock as AMPYRA sales fall, but INBRIJA begins to rise. Even though INBRIJA could provide meaningful sales for the company, my interest is the company\\'s ARCUS Technology, and other potential deals to arise from this asset. \\n\\n\\n Source Company Overview Acorda Therapeutics “Acorda” goal is to develop therapies that improve function and the lives of patients with neurological disorders. This will be accomplished by developing therapies that address the future for patients with neurological diseases, but also attempting improve their current function for a better today. By focusing on developing new medications that provide relief and repair damage to neurological disorders, Acorda is able to address the unmet needs of these acute patient populations. These therapies include the recently approved INBRIJA for intermittent treatment of OFF episodes in patients with Parkinson’s disease treated with carbidopa/levodopa. INBRIJA is a levodopa drug/device combo that employs Acorda’s pioneering ARCUS pulmonary delivery system that delivers the medication through inhalation. In addition, Acorda markets AMPYRA (dalfampridine extended release) for multiple sclerosis patients with a walking impairment. On top of the company’s marketed products, Acorda has a promising pipeline filled with neurological candidates that take on migraines, multiple sclerosis, and primary sclerosing cholangitis. ARCUS Platform The ARCUS Technology Platform allows systemic delivery of medication via inhalation, by converting molecules into a light dry powder. This permits supply of considerably higher doses of medication than can be transported by means of conventional dry powder technologies. ARCUS has the potential to be implemented in the development of an assortment of inhaled medicines. Acorda acquired the ARCUS technology platform in their 2014 acquisition of Civitas Therapeutics. INBRIJA Parkinson’s is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder brought about by the continuing loss of certain neurons in the brain. These neurons are in control of generating dopamine, and that loss produces an assortment of symptoms comprising of impaired movement, muscle stiffness and tremors. As the disease advances, patients are more likely to exhibit “OFF” periods, which are categorized by the reoccurrence of their Parkinson’s symptoms regardless of their levodopa therapy. It is estimated that one million people in the United States are diagnosed with Parkinson’s; and of that population, it is estimated that roughly 40% of those patients experience OFF periods.\\n \\n\\n Source INBRIJA is the first and only inhaled levodopa to treat these patients with OFF episodes from levodopa therapy. INBRIJA uses Acorda’s innovative ARCUS platform for inhaled therapeutics to provide a rapid relief therapy to their symptoms; which I like to relate it to a fast acting inhaler for asthmatics. This allows Parkinson’s patients who are on levodopa therapy to address their symptoms upon their onset with minimal disruption to their day’s activities. The company has planned to launch INBRIJA in the United States in Q1 of 2019. The company has plans to market INBRIJA to the 1.2M Parkinson’s patients in Europe. Back in March, Acorda submitted a Marketing Authorization Application  \"MAA\" for INBRIJA to the European Medicines Agency \"EMA\" and was subsequently validated on May 29th. The EMA review of the MAA, and an opinion from the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use \"CHMP\" is projected to be within 210 days. Once the CHMP provides their opinion on INBRIJA, a final judgement on the subject of the MAA is decided by the European Commission. Unless there is any additional questions or amendments, that would put their target date to be around the end of December or beginning of January. AMPYRA AMPYRA is an extended-release formula of that is FDA approved to help improve walking speed in adult patients with MS. \\n\\n Sources AMPYRA is the only branded prescription MS therapy FDA approved MS-Walking. It is estimated that more than 400,000 MS patients in the United States have impaired walking due to the disease. These difficulties often lead to difficulty keeping up with family and friends, or simply attempting to catch a bus.\\n Unfortunately, for Acorda, the company has recently lost market exclusivity due to the recent court ruling that 4 of their patents are invalid. The United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit voted 2-1 against Acorda and defended a preceding ruling from a lower court. This ruling allows generics to enter the market and are currently eroding Acorda’s market share. However, Acorda is not giving up and has already filed for en banc appeal on the last ruling. Perhaps with all the court’s judges ruling, the outcome could go in Acorda’s favor. Pipeline The company’s goal is to be the leading neurological biopharmaceutical company through the development and commercialization of their in-house pipeline products and from in-licensing products. \\n\\n Figure 1: Acorda Pipeline (Source Acorda) BTT1023 (timolumab) After INBRIJA’s approval, the next pipeline candidate is BTT1023 (timolumab), an investigational compound for Primary Sclerosing Cholangitis \"PCS\". Acorda ultimately acquired the global development and commercialization rights to BTT1023 via the acquisition of Biotie Therapies in 2016. BTT1023 is a fully human monoclonal antibody that targets vascular adhesion protein-1 \"VAP-1\". Biotie piloted several preclinical and clinical studies suggesting VAP-1 may play a role in multiple inflammatory and fibrotic diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, inflammatory bowel disease and psoriasis. Acorda has decided to go on the fibrotic disease route and go after PSC, a rare, chronic disease that in the long run harms the bile ducts. Eventually, the bile ducts come to be blocked attributable to inflammation and fibrosis. Bile then accumulates in the liver, where it progressively damages liver cells and in time causes the liver to fail. With no approved drug therapies for PSC, liver transplant is the only reliable treatment option.\\n BTT1023 is presently in Phase II development and is funded through the Efficacy and Mechanism Evaluation \"EME\" program in the United Kingdom. The FDA and EMA have designated BTT1023 as an orphan drug for PSC. Acorda is attempting to find strategic partners to further develop this therapy. The company has been expecting an update on this program since 2017; perhaps investors will get an update on phase II now that INBRIJA is approved. CVT-427 The next pipeline product to come from the ARCUS platform is CVT-427. The company has plans to develop CVT-427 as an inhaled zolmitriptan product for “acute treatment of migraine.” Migraines are characterized as very painful headaches that may be along with nausea, vomiting or sensitivity to light. It is estimated that about 36M people in the United States, and over 40M people in Europe, experience migraines. At this time, there are no approved inhaled migraine therapies. Obviously, a quicker relief to migraines would be favored by migraine sufferers. Unfortunately, most orally administered drugs are often a slower onset of action vs. IV, intranasal, or inhaled routes. Due to Zolmitriptan being an inhaled product, it is able to bypass the digestive system and is able to be rapidly absorbed through the lungs. In 2016, the company presented the pharmacokinetic \"PK\" data from the Phase I trial which displayed increased bioavailability and quicker absorption in relation to oral and nasal administration of the same active ingredient in healthy adults. The data exhibited that CVT-427 had a median Tmax of approximately 12 minutes for all dose levels compared to 1.5 hours for the oral tablet and 3.0 hours for the nasal spray. Acorda reported that there were no serious adverse events \"AEs\", dose-limiting toxicities, an indication of bronchoconstriction or terminations due to adverse events conveyed in this study. The most frequently reported treatment-emergent AEs were a cough, chest discomfort, headache, and feeling hot. Besides a cough, CVT-427 tolerability was in general consistent with the recognized safety profile of zolmitriptan.\\n In December 2016, they finished a special population study to gauge the safety of CVT-427 in asthmatics and in smokers. Some subjects exhibited evidence of acute, reversible bronchoconstriction, post-inhalation. The company plans to accelerate their work on reformulating the product and progressing the program now that INBRIJA has been approved. rHIgM22 rHIgM22 is Acorda’s remyelinating antibody intended for the treatment of MS. Preclinical studies have found that rHIgM22 promoted remyelination by stimulating oligodendrocytes to repair areas of demyelination. Preclinical studies with rHIgM22 also resulted in sustained improvements in motor activity. Back in April 2015, Acorda presented safety data from a Phase I clinical trial of rHIgM22. The data provided evidence that rHIgM22 was well-tolerated in each of the five tested doses. Furthermore, testing identified rHIgM22 in cerebrospinal fluid, demonstrating the drug’s contact with the central nervous system. However, a second Phase I trial using one of two doses of rHIgM22 in patients with an acute relapse showed “no difference between the treatment groups.” The company is deciding on the future steps for rHIgM22. Pipeline Focus Ultimately, Acorda’s R&D efforts are expected to advance CVT-427 as a potential acute treatment for a migraine. In addition, the company is looking to move forward with rHIgM22, but we are still waiting on some results for BTT1023 to see where that road takes the company. In the company’s last presentation, CEO Ron Cohen eluded to potentially out-licensing some of the pipeline’s non-neurology products, while potentially in-licensing some other neurology products. I expect the company to potential out-license BTT1023 while pushing forward with CVT-427 and adding another ARCUS based product. INBRIJA’s approval was a massive step forward for the company and future ARCUS products. Hopefully, the company can capitalize on this by developing both neurological and non-neurological products using ARCUS technology. This would allow the company to expand their own neurology pipeline, while out-licensing or partnering for non-neurological products.\\n Whatever the upcoming strategy is for the company, they are a long way from having another product on the market. Once a company becomes commercialized, I like to see a new product on the market every 18 months. Even if CVT-427 was to get every expedited designation possible, we would still be years off from a potential PDUFA for it. INBRIJA Launch Although INBRIJA’s PDUFA date was anticipated to be extended by a few months, the company prepared for their new flagship’s launch. While I don’t believe Ron smashed a champagne bottle over an INBRIJA device, I do imagine the company was relieved the approval was in hand before year-end. Acorda hosted a conference call to go over the details of INBRIJA and answer analyst questions about INBRIJA’s launch. One of the more important topics of discussion was the INBRIJA’s label. CEO Ron Cohen was pleased with the label, noting that there was no restriction on the label. However, there is a warning for asthma/COPD patients due to INBRIJA being an inhaled product and limited trial data in those populations. \\n\\n Source ACOR Acorda initial strategy is very similar to Adamas Pharmaceuticals\\' (ADMS) with their PD product GOCOVRI… get to the movement disorder centers and begin to educate the movement specialists on INBRIJA. Ultimately, the company intends to target 6,000 prescribers and focus on the top 3,800 who are responsible for half of the PD prescriptions. This strategy should get INBRIJA in the hands of the PD patients who are very likely to need INBRIJA consistently. In terms of payer coverage, Ron Cohen mention he was personally engaging in these affairs and discussion are “very constructive.” In addition, he believes that payers understand the need for INBRIJA for the PD population, and he is working hard with the payers to get a “win-win” for both parties.\\n \\n\\n Source: ACOR Analysts tried their best to extract pricing, sales/script projections, and payer forecasts from the CEO, but Ron was able to stick to his guns on remaining silent on those topics. With INBRIJA being a novel product, we cannot expect any accurate number for projected numbers. I was surprised I did not hear any analyst mention Sunovion’s APL-130277 product and its upcoming PDUFA in January 2019 for PD with motor fluctuations (OFF episodes). APL-130277 is an apomorphine sublingual film for the on-demand treatment of all types of motor OFF episodes. \\n\\n Source: Sunovion Although a CEO typically avoids announcing specific numbers for launch and pricing in a post-approval conference call, I have to expect Acorda’s numbers for INBRIJA are dependent on APL-130277’s approval. If approved, pricing, payer coverage, formulary, and timing of launch dates will be worth watching for. I believe APL-130277’s approval will have a hand in determining all of the above. Analyst Updates In addition to the continued biotech sell-off and overall market conditions, analyst updates have had negative impact on the share price. Most notably was the Goldman Sachs analyst Salveen Richter downgrade to a $10 price target. He cited an assumed annual pricing of $4,800, which will render to about $550M in U.S. peak sales, which is lower than the company\\'s estimated $800M. In addition, Raymond James analyst Laura Chico maintained an underperform rating on ACOR with a price target of $9 per share. With the share price hovering around $14-15 a share, investors should be moderately concerned with these sentiments considering the 30-40% downside projections.\\n Are the Analysts Correct? Usually, I find a point or two that I disagree with when professional analysts update or initiate their coverage on a biotech stock. I often disagree with their extensive use of fundamentals and potential market outlook to determine their price targets. Biotech stocks are typically high beta and often attract short-term and swing traders during binary events. In their defense, their job is to provide a fundamental outlook on the company and the competitive landscape. In the case of ACOR, I have to concede that company’s fundamentals are going to have a major hand in dictating the share price through 2019. The company has lost patent protection to AMPYRA and within 6-8 months launching INBRIJA. I anticipate the first half of 2019 to be rough for ACOR, especially around earnings reports. The stock should draw the attention of short sellers with the large percentage reduction in revenues. What do the charts point to? Well, the charts are not looking too strong for ACOR. Looking at the weekly chart ( Figure 2), we can see a long downtrend established in late 2015 has kept a lid on the share price, with only one good pop to $36.35 in June of this year. However, the stock has been finding some support around $14, which is close to a previous low in June 2017. \\n\\n Figure 2: ACOR Weekly (Source Trendspider)  The daily (Figure 3) is showing a mix of signals but does provide some hope a technical bounce if the stock can rise above $17.50. If not, I expect the stock to continue its current trajectory to the lower teens by the end of January. \\n\\n\\n Figure 3: ACOR Daily (Source Trendspider) Admittedly, I have previously traded ACOR with the intention of holding some for the long haul. Each time I enter, I always attempt to leave some because I believe in the company and their specialized market potential. However, this stock loves/hates the Relative Strength Index (RSI); it bounces up when oversold and sells-off when overbought. When attempting to add or initiate a position, I suggest investors should be paying attention to the RSI and other technicals with this stock. The hourly (Figure 4) displays the stock\\'s reaction to the RSI levels and moves acutely once it approaches or crosses an oversold/overbought area. \\n\\n Figure 4: ACOR Hourly (Source Trendspider)  If you decide to enter ACOR, please take a look at the charts before pressing the buy button. Is ACOR a Buy? Eventually, yes, but I foresee a continued downtrend going deep into 2019. The company has more on its near-term downside list than near-term upside list. The upcoming earnings reports should reveal diminished AMPYRA revenue with little help from INBRIJA. Other near-term downside comes from APL-130277’s potential approval, which could become a long-term issue if prescribers and/or payers favor over INBRIJA. Although the pipeline has potential winners, they are still early in development and are more of a risk than benefit at the moment. I suspect these downside events will eventually provide investors with an opportunity to buy into an established specialized biotech company. Acorda has a strong cash position of $400M; management believes the $400M will keep the company running till INBRIJA brings them cash flow positive. In addition, the company is expecting regulatory action from the EMA about INBRIJA. Cohen has mentioned they have been in talks with potential European partners but has not provided any actionable details for investors. If Acorda receives a positive ruling in Europe, this would deliver an opportunity for INBRIJA to produce another source of revenue and generate a positive change in the company’s long-term outlook. In addition, the company could pull a “Hail Mary” with AMPYRA’s court appeal and possibly regain patent protection. I don’t have too much confidence in that occurring, but it is still in play.\\n Eventually, ACOR will be a buy in 2019 and could be a long-term hold with the potential to be acquired if they are able to regain AMPYRA’s patent protection. The company has proven their ARCUS technology is able to deliver an FDA approved product, with the potential to bring a variety of other drug/device combinations to market. My game plan is to wait for the majority of the downside events to pass and see a trend in INBRIJA’s U.S. sales, then I will initiate a long position with the help of technical indicators.\\nDisclosure: I am/we are long ADMS.

Provisional worldwide shipment data from CEVA\\'s Internal Data & Strategy Analytics team reports that the company\\'s DSPs for handsets accounted for approximately 36% of the worldwide shipment volume in 2017, one in three handsets sold worldwide is powered by CEVA. The world\\'s giant smartphone and semiconductor companies incorporate CEVA\\'s DSPs. Equipped with a comprehensive product suite of signal processors and AI suite for 5G, the 5G arena will strengthen the firm\\'s operations and enhance both revenues and profit margins. The 5G factor is a critical driver behind my buy rating on CEVA. But CEVA\\'s capacity is not confined to smartphones only. Manufacturers of automotive ADAS, drones, surveillance cameras, wearables, industrial IoT and a variety of Bluetooth and Wi-Fi and medical products use CEVA\\'s DSPs and AI processors. The contribution is smaller in relation to cellphones, but explosion of these products and the IoT revolution in general makes me think that this will rapidly become a large revenue segment for CEVA. External research sources indicate that IOT services, voice-aided operations are set for significant boost in coming years. From a technological viewpoint, the anticipated proliferation makes sense.\\n My financial analysis shows that CEVA has been rapidly growing in last five years and the performance was excellent. Currently, the company has a leverage-free balance sheet. When I compared revenue growth and profit margins, and price to book value for CEVA\\'s rivals, I found that CEVA is currently undervalued. The most critical business risk I discovered is that CEVA competes with many internal teams from large semiconductor and smartphone companies. This is a point that is at the very core of the company\\'s competitive environment. Because the firm has demonstrated high potential for a long time, including excellent financial performance and market hold, CEVA is on top quartile of people\\'s watch list. Based on my research on its market positioning and valuation, CEVA shows strong potential for growth-oriented investors. Investment Drivers One of the key drivers for CEVA\\'s revenues is baseband for mobile manufacturers, which is one of the largest spaces in semiconductor industry. World\\'s renowned chip manufacturers incorporate CEVA\\'s IP into application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs) and application-specific standard products (ASSPs) that they manufacture, market and sell to wireless, consumer, automotive and IoT companies. The firm\\'s state-of-the-art technology has enabled it to ship more than 9 billion chips to date for a wide range of end markets. CEVA\\'s worldwide market share of handset baseband chips was approximately 36% of the worldwide shipment volume in 2017. Now that 5G is starting to gain some momentum, CEVA is capitalizing the new opportunities with its 5G enabled DSP platforms. Nokia\\'s 5G supplies for AT&T is powered by CEVA\\'s DSPs. ZTE has achieved successful test results from the third phase (3rd phase is seen as the last step before ZTE can proceed with its 5G commercialization plans) of national testing using CEVA\\'s technology, and there are more. \"Together with our 5G end-to-end offering, we are a one-stop shop for any newcomer or incumbent for wireless technologies.\"- Gideon Wertheizer, CEO, CEVA\\n Deloitte forecasts that by the end of 2023, more than 90% of adults in developed countries are expected to have a smartphone, with ownership among 55-75 year-olds reaching 85 percent. Deloitte Global predicts that owners will interact with their phones on average 65 times per day in 2023, a 20 percent in 2018. CEVA\\'s current market positioning places it in an optimum situation to continue growing its sales as smartphone market grows rapidly for next five years. \"The strength of our technology portfolio led to another quarter of sustained licensing revenue with 13 agreements executed across multiple end markets including in the two strategic ADAS space.\" Richard Kingston, Investor and Public Relations, CEVA \\n\\n Forecast by Counterpointresearch But the firm\\'s capability is not limited to handsets only. During 2017, it concluded 45 licensing deals, 43 of which are for non-cellular baseband applications. These non-cellular applications include automotive ADAS, drones, surveillance cameras, wearables, industrial IoT and a variety of Bluetooth and Wi-Fi connected consumer and medical products. In fact, as of its last fiscal year, its royalty revenues derived from non-cellular baseband products approximately doubled year over year, contributing to more than $8 million of royalty revenues. IoT market is definitely one of the rapidly growing markets worldwide, especially in developed countries, and I expect CEVA to have increasing sales contribution from this segment. \\n\\n\\n Data from Ernst & Young CEVA\\'s specialization and competitive edge in signal processing platforms for next generation long and short range wireless such as 5G, NB-IoT, 802.11ac and 802.11ax Wi-Fi technologies, and the inherent low cost, power and performance balance of its designs places in a strong position to simultaneously capitalize on mass market adoption of such technologies and address multiple markets and product sectors, including handsets, fixed wireless access, macro base stations, remote radio heads, cellular backhaul, small cells, Wi-Fi routers and a variety of machine type communications such as connected cars, smart cities and industrial markets. Together with its presence in the handset baseband market, Bluetooth and Wi-Fi IPs enables it to expand further into IoT applications and substantially increase its overall addressable market. Here CEVA\\'s addressable market size is expected to be 35 billion devices by 2020, as showed by data from ABI Research. Currently the shipments of products incorporating its Bluetooth IP are sizeable, with more than 200 million CEVA-powered Bluetooth chips shipped in 2017, up 45% from 138 million units in 2016. According to the latest Ericsson Mobility report, short range connected devices are expected to increase from six billion in 2017 to 17 billion in 2023 and long range IoT from 0.6 billion to 2.4 billion, a total installed base of 20 billion by 2023. To address a growing market potential for voice assisted devices (as voice is becoming the primary user interface for IoT applications, including mobile, automotive and consumer devices), the firm recently introduced ClearVox, a new voice input software and algorithm, that is offered in conjunction with its audio/voice DSPs. ClearVox, plus shows a proven track record in audio/voice processing, with more than 6 billion audio chips shipped to date, positions it in a strong position to power audio and voice roadmaps across this new range of addressable end markets. \\n\\n\\n Awareness and usage of applications featuring machine learning, Deloitte Report Financial Analysis CEVA has never posted a decline in revenue in last five years. Profit margins have been steadily growing since 2014, while there is a cyclical nature in FCF margins due to volatility in capital deployment. The 10k file reveals that substantial portion of its revenue comes from baseband DSP products for handsets, followed by non-baseband (audio, imaging and vision) DSP products and connectivity products. Although CEVA\\'s success in non-cellular DSP is commendable, it is evident that smartphone will keep powering a significant portion of its revenue forward. \\n\\n Data from 10k More than 70% of its revenues came from Asia Pacific, which makes sense because China and South Korea are the world\\'s largest smartphone manufacturers. U.S. accounts for 16-17% of its total revenue while Europe and Middle East accounts for roughly 12%. CEVA has a debt free balance sheet and has no off-balance sheet items. But there are operating lease obligations, which amount to roughly $2.07 million as of its last fiscal year. As of September 30, 2018, CEVA\\'s cash and cash equivalent balances, marketable securities and bank deposits were approximately $167 million. In its Q3, the company repurchased about 216,000 shares for approximately $6.3 million, which also gives the firm a technical cushion to its stock price. Valuation Because of the inherent bottom line volatility among technology firms that are similar to CEVA, price to book value serves as a better multiple for valuation purposes compared to price to earnings multiple. In fact, as of the most recent quarter, CEVA\\'s total asset reflected only 18% in goodwill and intangible asset, enhancing the importance of its high proportion of book value in total asset mix and making price to book value a reasonable indicator for valuation purposes on a relative basis.\\n   Ticker Company Name Market Cap Price/Book Revenue 3YR Earnings 3YR   (CEVA) CEVA, Inc. $460.16M 1.88 19.89% 9.30%   (DSPG) DSP Group, Inc. $238.61M 1.69 -4.36% -283.64%   (CDNS) Cadence Design Systems, Inc. $11.73B 9.33 7.12% 47.74%   (MPWR) Monolithic Power Systems, Inc. $4.78B 7.84 18.58% 13.85%   (DIOD) Diodes Incorporated $1.55B 1.66 6.06% 93.32%   (ATTU) Attunity Ltd $398.79M 5.93 20.73% 29.01%     Average   4.72 11.34% -15.07%   Data from Seeking Alpha The table above indicates that CEVA has generated positive results in some very turbulent times. Revenue was and earnings were substantially high than rivals, but valuation hasn\\'t appreciated as it supposed to be - creating a great opportunity for growth lovers. A further examination of its price to book value time-series shows that it is trading at record low levels. \\n\\n Chart from Seeking Alpha Risk Factors One of the key risk factors for CEVA is that it competes against internal engineering teams at companies like MediaTek, Qualcomm (QCOM), Samsung (OTC:SSNLF), Huawei and NXP (NXPI). Because these internal teams have direct access to their that product design and information, it gives them an extra advantage for designing their own DSPs. These teams design programmable DSP core products and signal processing cores in-house and therefore not license CEVA\\'s technologies. Yes, it has traditional face-to-face competitors, but these internal teams make it hard. Internal teams are often assigned by CEVA\\'s customers to find the \"best solution\" because they have a greater access to product information, needs and other specifics, and if these internal teams demonstrate greater strength then CEVA\\'s topline will face increasing pressure and may even have to cut pricing to retain market share.\\n The company\\'s quarterly operating results show fluctuations from quarter to quarter due to its lengthy sales cycle, so the volatility is sort of inherent. The implication of lengthy sales cycle is crucial, because a company is stuck with large inventory during which technological factors can materially change. Long sales cycles may also hold back CEVA to effectively organize its new innovation projects because firms often want to clear its existing inventory and phase them out first before moving on to newer products, endangering their pace with innovation. The third key risk I consider is its currency risk due to globally exposed revenue stream. Moreover, the majority of its expenses are denominated in foreign currencies, mainly New Israeli Shekel and the EURO, which exposes to the risks of foreign currency fluctuations. One good thing is that CEVA has a debt-free capital structure which gives it a strong balance sheet. However, all the other factors discussed are critical and may materially harm the firm from continuing with such high market shares and solid financial performance. Conclusion CEVA has placed itself distinctively in smartphone and related technological sectors that has various DSP requirements. The company has demonstrated stellar results with cellular technology but also has a strong footing in industries such as WiFi, voice-directed services and other communication services. Financial performance was excellent with strengthening market share. The end markets that it serves are set for high growth and the firm is already in an optimum position to leverage its existing relationship with renowned manufacturers of technological products. Based on my understanding and analysis of CEVA and its end markets, the stock is a strong buy for growth oriented investors. If you have a comparatively greater risk tolerance and would rather invest in firms with high growth potential, then CEVA is for you.\\nDisclosure: I/we have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

The stock reached a 52-week high of $18.50 in the third quarter just prior to Q3 earnings. The peak was at least three times higher than its 52-week low established early in the year. Endo's top line has been in decline due to a run-off in sales of pain-related drugs like Opana, Voltaren, and Percocet. The government continues to tamp down on the sale of pain-related drugs as the opioid epidemic has amplified the number of drug-related deaths in the U.S.    Drug overdoses represent the largest cause of accidental deaths in the United States; they recently surpassed car accidents. Many believe the rise in drug overdoses has been driven by the use of prescription opioids. According to the National Institute on Drug Abuse, in 2016, the number of drug overdoses were 64,000, up 23% Y/Y and more than twice the 23,518 reported in 2002. In 2002, opioid prescription drug overdoses were 32% of total drug overdoses. That figure increased to 43% in 2015, and 59% in 2016. Opioid prescription overdoses continue to hit record highs even after the government's concerted efforts to reduce them. The rise in prescription opioids has also drawn the attention of lawmakers. Opioid prescriptions were 219 million in 2011; this was nearly triple the number reported 20 years earlier despite the fact the level of pain felt by Americans may not have increased proportionately. Others believe opioid manufacturers might have aggressively marketed these drugs to doctors without properly describing the risks. \\n Total Q3 revenue of $745 million was down 5% Y/Y. This followed a double-digit decline in Q2. Revenue from Sterile Injectables rose 17% Y/Y while every other segment fell. Sterile Injectables is Endo's second-largest product segment at 32% of total revenue. Generics (35% of revenue) experienced a 12% decline. Sterile Injectables could be a strong moat going forward. Xiaflex, currently indicated to treat Dupuytren's contracture (hand disorder) and Peyronie's disease (erectile dysfunction), could be another catalyst. Endo acquired the product in 2015 when it bought Auxilium Pharmaceuticals for $2.6 billion. The company is attempting to get Xiaflex approved to treat cellulite, which has a market size of over $3 billion. Xiaflex could become the first non-surgical treatment for cellulite. This sounds exciting. In November, the company announced results of Phase III clinical trials, which indicated Xiaflex showed statistically significant improvement for subjects with cellulite. However, the market was not impressed with the results, and the stock sold off hard. ENDP is off over 50% after reporting remarkable Q3 results. Some of the sell-off was company-specific, as the market was unimpressed with Xiaflex's market potential. I interpreted the immediate sell-off as profit-taking. However, ENDP continues to decline as broader markets enter correction territory. How To Play The Sell-Off I bought a small amount of puts in case ENDP continues to fall. I expect broader markets to decline further as the Fed removes the punch bowl. This could take ENDP down with it. I have also been cognizant of short interest in ENDP. There were 26 million shares sold short just prior to earnings. \\n\\n Source: Shock Exchange\\n I assumed positive earnings, and a potential short squeeze would send ENDP to the moon. Unfortunately, the shorts have won out. Selling pressure post-earnings and overall market volatility have spurred even more selling pressure. Short interest has fallen from 26 million shares prior to earnings to about 18 million shares on December 14, 2018. I expect shorts to continue to create more selling pressure heading into Q4 earnings in February. By that time, the bad news should be fully priced in. Another solid earnings report - modest declines in the top line and stable EBITDA margins - could cause ENDP to spike higher. Moreover, in the first half of 2019, Endo expects to gather information on how Xiaflex will be priced. Management will seek FDA approval likely in the second half of 2019 in advance of a potential 2020 product launch. I expect either Q4 earnings or chatter about Xiaflex's true market potential will drive ENDP higher. Any major news could cause shorts to cover. We could be looking at another 52-week high in the second half of 2019. Conclusion I expect to accumulate more shares just before Q4 earnings are announced. Drug companies are facing loss of exclusivity and are having their own shares pounded amid the market rout. Next year, Endo could be viewed as one of the few pharmaceutical companies capable of delivering revenue and earnings growth from its R&D pipeline. ENDP remains a buy.\\nDisclosure: I am/we are long ENDP. I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions. I am not receiving compensation for it (other than from Seeking Alpha).

My investment thesis was bullish on the stock in the summer back at $160 and the stock has only hit new lows in this market correction. The activists that seemed unwelcome in June might actually be warranted at this point as the market loses confidence in management based on the current absurd valuation. \\n\\nImage Source: Allergan website Earnings Cuts Despite Q3 results besting estimates, analysts have uniformly cut 2019 and 2020 EPS estimates. The numbers still remain absurdly high for a stock trading at only $133, but the downward direction of estimates typically impedes a stock rally. \\n\\nAGN EPS Estimates for Current Fiscal Year data by YCharts Note that the Q3 numbers were impacted by $0.16 due to the Ozurdex recall in Europe and foreign exchange translation. The numbers could've actually smashed estimates so the potential exists from a boost to EPS. Regardless of the upside potential, the more important issue is that Wall Street is losing confidence with management with the suggestion that 2019 estimates don't actually top 2017 numbers as long projected by Allergan. Analysts now forecast 2019 dipping below the strong 2018 numbers, yet management had this to say back heading into 2018 per CEO Brent Saunders on the Q3'17 earnings call.\\n Regardless of the scenario, I want to make it clear that 2019 non-GAAP performance net income per share will be higher than in 2017, even though 2017 includes a full year of sales of RESTASIS and the other products potentially facing loss of exclusivity. Despite the revenue and earnings headwinds from LOEs, we think this is both realistic and achievable. The company wasn't even willing to discuss 2019 numbers on the Oct. 30 earnings call. The market has perceived this shift away from 2019 numbers in a negative light. The perception always appears worse than the reality with Allergan, but the current execution problems aren't helping. Execution Issues Anybody digging into the quarterly numbers that include solid EPS trends can probably make a strong case for buying the stock at this price. Allergan now trades at only 8x '19 EPS estimates. \\n\\nAGN data by YCharts The problems facing the stock are lost confidence in the execution ability of management. With Restasis facing generic competitors, the market already was on high alert and recent recalls aren't helping despite the minimal impacts to financials. What the market saw was Allergan report a 3% revenue decline in Q3 due to a recall with Ozurdex and the ongoing declines in revenues from Restasis. The fears mount that the biopharma is facing a decade of declines. The reality is that the core business that accounts for the majority of the business grew at a 7.4% currency-neutral rate and 5.9% when including the currency impact. \\n\\nSource: Allergan Q3'18 presentation\\n So despite some hiccups in the business, the core business is growing. Ozurdex will rebound next year and the Coolsculpting revenue slowdown is a business model shift toward discounting the machines in order to derive more revenues from consumables. \\n\\nSource: Allergan Q3'18 presentation The additional textured breast implant issue hasn't helped the market confidence issues. Some concerns that the breast implants have a link to anaplastic large-cell lymphoma caused French regulators to request a recall of the product, forcing Allergan to remove the product from the market in Europe. The key here is that the product line that also includes smooth breast implants not recalled only accounted for $94 million in Q3 revenues and the impacted international revenues were only $36 million. Of course, any financial risk of an association to breast cancer would be a problem for the stock. The actual financial impact of the removal of this product line within Europe is minimal when the product remains still available in the largest market in the US. Capital Returns While the market is sweating some of the quarter-to-quarter hits with production recalls and LOEs, the biopharma continues to return cash to shareholders while repaying debt. In Q3 alone, Allergan returned $695 million to shareholders while repaying $1.75 billion in debt. \\n\\nSource: Allergan Q3'18 presentation The capital return plan is suddenly meaningful when the market cap is down to only $45 billion. Not only is the dividend up to 2.2%, but also the buyback yield would've hit 4.0% on an annual rate. All while the company spent what could've amounted to an additional 4% buyback by paying down debt.\\n The biggest issue with the large buybacks in 2017 was the reduced flexibility to buy shares on further weakness. Takeaway The key investor takeaway is that investors might actually start to welcome bigger participation of activists like Appaloosa LP and Senator Investment Group LP. The company appears to have to many moving parts to effectively manage with constant issues with product recalls and execution problems while facing LOE headaches. In addition, the company spent too aggressively on stock buybacks at much higher prices. The recommendation is to not get too negative on the stock here as the core business grows and some activist moves could boost Allergan.

The former move was due to oil prices having recovered back to the $70/bbl range. The latter move came after the oil price collapse in the fall (aided by Saudi Arabia increasing production). The previous monthly record for U.S. crude oil production - 10.044 million BPD set in November 1970 - was broken earlier in the year. That number rose throughout 2018, reaching 11.475 million BPD by September. Oil prices were up and down in 2018, with West Texas Intermediate (WTI) and Brent crude starting the year at $60/bbl and a little under $67/bbl, respectively. By October, WTI was near $80/bbl and Brent had made it above $86/bbl. With just a few days remaining in 2018, WTI has dipped to $45/bbl while Brent crude is around $54/bbl. Natural gas saw a sudden resurgence in the fall of this year, experiencing a monthly average above $4/MMBtu for the first time in several years. The Permian Basin saw a rapidly rising production rate in 2018, and appears set to gain additional momentum in 2019. Ethanol producers got a boost this year after the resignation of Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Scott Pruitt, who was rather hostile toward the industry, and the ending of restrictions on the year-round sale of fuel blends containing 15% ethanol (E15). China\\'s solar sector took a hit in 2018, in part due to a 30% tariff imposed by the U.S. on imported solar equipment for at least the next four years. This, in turn, led to a decline in the global growth rate of solar power. \\n We\\'d love to get your thoughts on the above items or anything else you found noteworthy this year. What\\'s your opinion on what 2019 holds for the energy sector? Where do you think the price of oil is headed in the coming year? What about natural gas prices in the new year? Please leave us your comments below. As we close out the year, we want to reiterate that we greatly appreciate the contributions from all of our readers, so please keep them coming.

We provide a reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to our GAAP financial measures in our earnings release. You can obtain a copy of our earnings release by visiting our website.\\nI would now like to turn the call over to Ari Kahn, our CEO and our President.\\nRoger Kahn\\nThank you, Carole, and good afternoon, everyone. In 2018, Bridgeline acquired customers from several verticals, including healthcare, association, finance and manufacturing. Overall, we saw a trend in B2B, with the manufacturing sector showing significant interest. We also saw international requirements and partnered with some of our customers to expand our product line to meet the needs of this trend.\\nOur partnership with international manufacturing customers resulted in the upcoming launch of version 7 of our platform, which includes a new feature set called Unbound Commerce variant that includes unique localization capabilities for currencies, taxation, inventory, logistics and compliance, it may vary from country to country.\\nAs part of these same trends, we're also launching the Unbound Translate product, which will enable a direct integration with translation systems to expedite for publication of content to international sites.\\nBridgeline has partnered with Lingotek on this new product to leverage their network of translation specialists and workflow software to give our customers seamless and cost-effective translation of content on their websites and online product catalogs.\\nCommerce variants and translation goes hand-in-hand with Bridgeline's GDPR-hosting capabilities to help our customers with European side to expand to new customers in Europe where recent regulatory changes are causing many companies to redesign their web presence. In addition to variants and translation, these further helped Bridgeline differentiated the platform and multinational companies in addition to our unique B2B capabilities.\\n\\nA recent customer win is a manufacturer of office workspace accessories who is using Bridgeline to evaluate strategies for increasing B2B online revenues and improve branding through its website.\\nBridgeline's unique capabilities in the B2B space helped create this relationship and our continued innovation will provide additional value through the company's valuation process. In general, B2B companies make larger investments in their websites than their B2C counterparts.\\nBridgeline was selected by the AARP and the UnitedHealthcare to launch a new website for their AARP longevity network. This site will assist investors and entrepreneurs in health care who want to break into the age 50 plus market with a platform for gathering ideas and accessing shared resources online.\\nIn health care, Bridgeline was selected by an organization that operates several hospitals in the Northeast to create patient engagement. They intend to create a multi-language site with content for self-health and self-education as wells as events, blogs and physician directories.\\nBridgeline's recent advances in version 7 for variants and its translation partnership with Lingotek create opportunities to add additional value to this health care organizations initiative.\\nIn our last earnings call, we mentioned that one customer of ours, who has several contracts with Bridgeline, canceled one of its agreements, effective September 30. While this customer may have canceled due to strategic redirection of that organization, this only impacts one of its contracts and the others are still active with Bridgeline, continuing to have a strong relationship with the customer. However, the contract that was canceled is significant and impacts revenues by approximately $375,000 per quarter.\\nOn our last call, we discussed our strategy for 2019, which is to prioritize inorganic growth. To this end, Bridgeline provides deep strategic value to its customers when trusted with multiyear initial commitments. And our challenge is that new customer acquisition takes a long time with high marketing cost due to the depth and strategic value our customers must place in our platform.\\nOur customers look to us for new features and products to add to their digital marketing suite, which are typically technical point solutions that sit on top of our side of our platform.\\nIndeed, marketing technology sector has thousands of small companies with excellent point solutions that have rapid sale cycles, but as technical products, they are not best positioned to be the sole product in a standalone company.\\nBridgeline often integrates with these solutions and has been approached by some of them seeking combination. These solutions have large customer bases and short sale cycles, which is a great complement to our more in-depth product that has longer sales cycles.\\nWe believe Bridgeline can reduce customer acquisition costs for its core platform and more rapidly grow by combining with some of these companies, cross selling their products into our customer base and cross selling our platform into their customer base while providing a more strategic and longer term relation to their customers.\\nTo this end, Bridgeline conducted a secondary public offering for $5 million and has begun actively speaking with candidate companies. We've made progress with one company regarding the combination and are hopeful to not only close that acquisition in the upcoming quarter but to find at least one more in 2019 that can bring our revenues towards the $20 million level, tripling our customer base where a significant portion of our pipeline for platform sales would come from up-sells to existing customers and our addition of technical products to our suite for a more rapid new customer acquisition would occur. This would reduce customer acquisition cost and accelerate the growth of our customer base.\\n\\nAt this time, I'd like to turn the call over to our Chief Financial Officer, Carole Tyner, who'll provide more details on the financial results for our fourth quarter. Carole?\\nCarole Tyner\\nThanks, Ari. Today, I will review the financial results for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018, as well as the results for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2018.\\nFirst, I'll touch on revenue. Total revenue for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018 was $2.8 million, compared to $4.2 million in the fourth quarter of last year. The following are some details of the various components of revenue.\\nFirst, I'd like to talk about our license revenue. Total license revenue comprises our subscription-based licenses, or what we call SaaS licenses, and our perpetual licenses decreased to $1.2 million for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018 compared to $1.8 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017.\\nWe had approximately $269,000 in perpetual license sales in the fourth quarter of 2018 - of last year - excuse me, 2017 last year compared to only $8,000 in the fourth quarter of this year.\\nAs it is for most software companies, perpetual license can be inconsistent from quarter-to-quarter, but we do strive to offer our customer the choice of the type of license based on their organization and structure.\\nOur SaaS revenue was $1.1 million for the fourth quarter of 2018 compared to $1.4 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017. The primary reason for the decline is due to the loss of a larger customer who was acquired and therefore compelled to not renew their contract. Also contributing to the decline was the price negotiation of another large customer's contract to a lower rate.\\nOur hosting revenue decreased slightly from $263,000 in the fourth quarter of 2017 to $206,000 in the fourth quarter of this year. The decrease in revenue was due to attrition related to customers that were obtained from prior acquisitions that we no longer wanted to support.\\nOur recurring revenue, which consists of SaaS licenses, annual maintenance on perpetual licenses and hosting, decreased to $1.4 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018 compared to $1.8 million in the fourth quarter of last year. Again, this decrease is driven by the drop in SaaS revenues as previously mentioned.\\nOur annualized recurring revenue, or ARR, at the end of the fourth quarter, was approximately $5.9 million. Our new engagements are typically 3-year contracts with 1-year auto renewal.\\nOur services revenue was $1.4 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018 compared to $2.2 million in the fourth quarter of last year. As longer term projects started to wind down, the decrease in new engagements impacted overall services revenues.\\nHowever, we will be focusing on increasing our pipeline by selling new engagements and providing add-on services to our existing customer base, in addition to what Ari mentioned about driving some cross-sells with potential partnerships.\\nMoving on to gross margin. Our gross margin for the fourth quarter was 51.3% compared to 54.8% in the fourth quarter of last year. The decline in the margin is primarily due to the decline in license revenue. Cost to hold the subscription customers with our partner Amazon Web Services are relatively fixed cost and therefore can impact our margins.\\nWe will continue to review our hosting infrastructure, which is highly scalable. We have invested in baseline improvements so they can deliver better margins as the customer base grows. Our new products are hosted for our existing customer.\\nWe reduced our operating expenses by 20.8% to $2 million for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018 compared to $2.6 million for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017. Please note that this excludes a non-cash goodwill impairment charge of $243,000.\\n\\nOver the past few years, we have committed to a restructuring plan and have significantly reduced our facilities costs and overall general spending.\\nAs I just mentioned, we had a goodwill impairment in the fourth quarter of $243,000. In the quarter ended June fiscal 2018, we adopted a new accounting standard that simplifies the impairment tests or goodwill.\\nThe carrying value of the company as compared to the fair value and if there is an impairment then that is recorded as a charge in that period. The impairment testing in the fourth quarter of 2018 resulted in this non-cash goodwill impairment charge of $243,000.\\nMoving to the bottom line, our net loss of $947,000 compared to $332,000 in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017. The $947,000 losses included the impairment charge of $243,000. However, excluding the goodwill impairment charge, the net loss would be $703,000 for 2018.\\nOur non-GAAP adjusted net loss of $555,000 or a loss of $0.13 per diluted share in the fourth quarter compared to non-GAAP adjusted net loss of $98,000 or a loss of $0.02 per diluted share in the fourth quarter of last year.\\nOur adjusted EBITDA for the fourth quarter of 2018 was a loss of $414,000 compared to a gain of $41,000 or income in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017.\\nAnd I would like to draw your attention to talk about the full year of 2018 as compared to 2017. Our revenue for fiscal 2018 decreased 16.7% to $13.6 million compared to $16.3 million for the same period last year. This was primarily due to the decrease in new license deals and the resulting in services engagements.\\nOur subscription and license revenue decreased to $5.6 million from $6.8 million in the previous year. Perpetual license sales in fiscal 2017 were $721,000 compared to $80,000 in fiscal '18.\\nAgain, perpetual license can cause inconsistency and some lumpiness in our financials. The decline in SaaS licenses is primarily due to the reasons I mentioned previously regarding the acquisition of a customer.\\nOur services revenue decreased 18% to $16.9 million compared to $8.5 million in the previous year. Gross margins also decreased from 56.1% for fiscal 2017 to 50.3% in fiscal 2018. The primary contributor to the decline was a decrease in license revenue, particularly the lumpiness from the perpetual license.\\nOur operating costs for fiscal 2018 were reduced by 14.9% to $9 million compared to $10.5 million at fiscal 2017, which is actually an improvement of $1.6 million. This excludes the non-cash goodwill impairment charge of $4.9 million.\\nAlso excluding the $4.9 million goodwill impairment charge, we had a net loss of $2.4 million in fiscal 2018 compared to a net loss of $1.6 million in 2017.\\nAdjusted EBITDA was a loss of $1 million in fiscal 2018 compared to income of $122,000 in fiscal 2017. However, as I mentioned, we did make significant reductions to our facilities and reduced our overall operating expenses year-over-year.\\nTurning now to our balance sheet. At September 30, 2018, the company had cash and accounts receivables of $2.4 million. Our total assets were $11 million and our total liabilities were $6.6 million.\\nTotal debt at September 30 was $3.6 million, which is comprised of $2.1 million from our line of credit and the remaining amount related to a term loan and promissory note. Just to note that the promissory notes were paid off in October when we raised a net $3.4 million in our public offering.\\nI would like to thank you all for listening. At this time, we would like to open up the call to questions and answers.\\nQuestion-and-Answer Session\\nOperator\\n[Operator Instructions] And I'm showing no questions on the phone lines at this time. I'd now like to turn the call back to Mr. Ari Kahn for closing remarks.\\nRoger Kahn\\nThank you. Thank you all for listening and taking the time to join us for today's update. We appreciate the support and patience of all of our shareholders, and it's our goal to continue building a scalable business which in turn will build shareholder value. We are very excited about our strategy for 2019. Thank you for joining us today. We look forward to speaking to you again in our Q1 2019 conference call. Have a great weekend, everybody, and happy holidays.\\n\\nOperator\\nLadies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference. This does conclude the program. You may all disconnect. Everyone, have a great day.\"]}\n"

We were expecting GPMT to utilize CLO's to maximize their net spread.The current dividend level still looks solid, but growth may be slowed. Buy-and-hold investors are entering hold territory. Wait for dips to add. Traders can take gains and reallocate.\"], 'article': [\"Granite Point Mortgage Trust (GPMT) has been on our radar since the IPO. It was our largest position for large parts of 2018. However, our rating is now neutral. The Q3 2018 earnings call was a significant factor in our decision to lower the rating. We provided a complete breakdown of Granite Point's Q3 2018 presentation. For the next week that article will be accessible to all readers (no subscription required). Notes from Granite Point Mortgage Trust Q3 2018 Earnings Call Note: The earnings call occurred on the morning of November 6th, 2018. This was published to subscribers in real-time. We will include an updated price chart at the end. The Granite Point Mortgage Trust earnings call was generally received well. It combined with their earnings release to drive GPMT higher on the day relative to their sector peers: \\n\\n GPMT is the best performer by a significant margin, which leads us to think this might be a reasonable place to reduce our rating. Sometimes these trends will continue, but it is more common to see them revert.\\n This article is going to deal a bit with technical aspects and a bit with fundamental aspects. The fundamentals were a critical part of the analysis, but the technicals helped us to pick the precise point. This chart shows where the ceiling appears to be forming for GPMT: \\n\\n When we look at a 3-month chart, we notice a similar trend: \\n\\n It appears that is often a seller showing up each day willing to sell around $19.00, which makes it harder for further gains in share price to occur. The final factor we’re considering is that in previous cases where the market became more concerned about the segment or the economy, we’ve seen GPMT punished to an absurd degree: \\n\\n Remember that these 4 REITs hold very similar assets. We’ve appreciated GPMT because they have traded at a lower price-to-book ratio and because their incentive fee kicked in at a higher level of 8% compared to the standard 7%. Price-to-book for TPG RE Finance Trust (TRTX) and GPMT is now extremely similar. Apollo Commercial Real Estate Finance (ARI) and Blackstone Mortgage Trust (BXMT) still trade at substantial premiums, but we’re no longer predicting a healthy premium to book as a likely scenario due to a slight weakening in fundamentals for future results.\\n Fundamentals The earnings call gave us some added insight into fundamentals. Analysts overall seem quite pleased with the results, given the outperformance in the share price. However, we heard a couple of things that concerned us. Minor Drag for Q4 2018 Earnings The first was management indicating that their most recent debt issuance will create a drag on fourth-quarter earnings results. This is only the expected result for one quarter, but it still suggests we may see negative revisions to analyst forecasts for Q4 earnings. That could put a little negative pressure on the price in the short term. At the least, it would make it more difficult to create a sustained move past $19.00. Weakening yield available on Assets Designed for CLOs The next issue was the most significant one. In our review of the earnings release, we highlighted that we wanted to see GPMT moving to produce additional CLO’s to lock in the credit spread. The CLO assets and liabilities both carry floating rates, but currently, the credit spread on CLO’s has been very attractive. Management addressed that specifically on the earnings call. They indicated that in loan origination there was significantly more competition for loans that would fit nicely into the CLO structure. Essentially, other lenders were focusing on writing loans that would fit into a CLO and consequently the yield on those assets was weakening materially. This is a significant issue because we were looking for GPMT to grow their spreads through this structure, but management indicated that the competition there has very recently intensified. Consequently, we cannot reasonably expect that to be the path forward. Valuation We’re dropping our price-to-book targets for the strong-buy and regular-buy ratings by about 1% throughout the commercial mortgage REITs to reflect this tightening of credit spreads. The new threshold for GPMT comes in at $18.96. As it stands GPMT is less than 2% from their 52-week high. Adjusted for dividends, GPMT is setting a new 52-week high today (11/6/2018).\\n Original Conclusion For investors who are holding GPMT for the long-term, this is a non-issue. It simply implies that we are no longer in the ideal buying range. It would be ideal to put new capital to work after some fear works its way into the market again. The current dividend level is still covered. We might see growth in the next declaration, but it is very much a “might” situation at this point. For buy-and-hold investors, we’ve entered the “hold” period. We don’t see much reason to be the investor buying right up against the ceiling, even though it appears quite arbitrary. For investors who are trading GPMT, we think this is a reasonable time to take some profits off the table. We could see a move higher with share prices breaking $19.00, but the expectation for lower Q4 projections makes us doubt that the artificial ceiling is about to break in a sustainable way. Meanwhile, we face the risk of share prices declining if the market begins to demonstrate any fear about commercial lending. We are looking to close out the majority (not all) of our position so we can have the capital available. If GPMT suddenly dives, we could use the capital to buy those shares again. Alternatively, we may hunt for some other preferred shares or in some of the other REIT sectors. Currently, our allocation to mortgage REITs is particularly high as we also took positions recently in Dynex Capital (DX), Capstead Mortgage (CMO), and MFA Financial (MFA). We’re seeing very nice recoveries currently in the share prices for CMO and MFA leading us to some solid unrealized gains. Last night we indicated that we were hoping for a jump in the price. We referred to the results as a “decent” quarter and didn’t anticipate that it was going to drive the jump we wanted. Despite our reading of the quarter as “decent” other analysts appear to have a more favorable read. Update to Article Update: Seeking Alpha published the transcript. We're showing the question and answer below. The section in red was the most important bit of information on the call:\\n \\n\\n Update to Article - 12/28/2018 For the public release, we're adding another update. The first thing to update is the price chart. This new chart runs through the current date and time: \\n\\n We've placed a few trades since then also. Since the initial release, we harvested gains in CMO and GPMT. We remain long in MFA and DX.   \\n\\nThe REIT Forum focuses primarily on defensive investments with high growth potential. It is our objective to find quality investments at a discount, along with trading opportunities for the more active investors. Most of our research is on companies that are excellent investments over the long term.Disclosure: I am/we are long MFA, DX, MFA.PB, ARI.PC,CMO.PE.

NCSM\\'s Canada operations and outlook \\n\\n In NCS Multistage\\'s Canadian operations, its revenue of $29.1 million for Q3 2018 was lower by 28% compared to the year ago.

Competitions from NCSM\\'s peers were high in Saskatchewan and in the Cardium in Western Canada, which have light crude oil resources.\\n In Q3 2018, the prices for providing fracturing pumping services in Canada declined. Not only did the spot market pricing, which indicates the demand for short-run, decreased, but rates for some of the longer-term work in the Canadian basin also went down. Lack of infrastructure in comparison to the supply boost in many parts of North America, including Canada and the Permian Basin in Texas, caused the price to fall. Investors may note that Western Canada Select (WCS), which tracks heavy oil from Canada, typically trades at a discount relative to WTI. The lower price reflects quality issues, as well as the cost of transport from Alberta to refineries in the U.S. In November, Canadian producers were fetching above $30 per barrel less than their counterparts in the United States. Since early 2018, when the Canadian pipelines began to saturate, the discount started to grow significantly. The inability of the Canadian oil industry to build a major pipeline from Alberta to either the U.S. or the Pacific Ocean is increasingly dragging down WCS. Keystone XL, Northern Gateway, Energy East, Trans Mountain Expansion - all of these pipeline projects have run into long delays. Over the long-term, however, NCSM\\'s management expects the completion of a Keystone XL or the TMS Expansion to resolve the crude oil takeaway capacity constraints. Plus, not all of the company\\'s customers are exposed to the current spot prices as many have been able to hedge their exposure or price their crude at hubs where differentials are not as extreme. Seasonally, the first quarter is NCSM\\'s most active quarter for the year. This leads to anticipating higher activity from NCSM\\'s business from the upstream segment in Q1 2019. However, the upstream companies\\' budget for FY2019 is likely to be set keeping in mind the crude oil differential trend and their profit potential. Given the increasing gap between the prices, the short-term outlook appears to be dimmer. NCSM\\'s U.S. operations and outlook \\n\\n\\n In NCS Multistage\\'s U.S. operations, its revenue of $26.3 million for Q3 2018 was nearly double compared to a year ago. The drilling and exploration activities in the U.S. unconventional shales increased significantly in the past year. NCSM achieved its fourth consecutive quarter of sequential unit sales growth in sliding sleeves and composites frac plugs sales in Q3. In the past years, NCSM has increasingly sourced its revenues from the U.S. However, compared to Q2 2018, the U.S. revenues decreased by 5%. The sequential decline was primarily attributable to services provided during pinpoint completions and tracer diagnostics. In the past couple of months, some of the key U.S. shales including the Permian in Texas were hit by capacity infrastructure constraints and a slowdown in well completions activity. Investors may note that drilled but uncompleted wells, or DUCs, represent wells that will likely be completed at some point in the future. Since the beginning of 2018, DUCs in the U.S. has increased by 26%, according to EIA\\'s estimates. This indicates a slowdown in well completions activity, which was fueled by a 33% fall in WTI crude oil price in the past year. NCSM\\'s premier solution pinpoint stimulation optimizes completion designs and increases well productivity. The completions activity headwind, if continued for a more extended period, can affect PFIE negatively. The revival of the DUCs is closely linked to the crude oil price\\'s recovery from the current depression. If the fall in price is short-lived, as expected by analysts, NCSM\\'s products will see higher demand in the medium-term. How are NCSM\\'s premier product technologies advancing? \\n\\n In this context, it is pertinent to discuss NCSM\\'s primary offerings including the pinpoint stimulation and tracer diagnostics. This trend towards more complex well completions has also resulted in increased use of tracer diagnostics services, which can be utilized to assess the effectiveness of various well completion techniques. Some of the wells where pinpoint stimulation techniques have been used involve a high number of stages in drilling. Typically, with rising lateral lengths in horizontal wells, more stages are required to ensure effective stimulation occurs. This widens the scope of pinpoint stimulation. In tracer diagnostics, NCSM commercialized its water-soluble tracer product offering in Q3. Also during the quarter, NCSM achieved the first commercial sales of the Purple Seal Express frac-plug deployment system.\\n However, upstream companies have the options of using NCSM\\'s pinpoint versus other OFS companies\\' traditional plug-and-perf technology. NCSM\\'s biggest competitors offer plug-and-perf, which can be less costly in a certain situation and drilling methods. As hydraulic fracturing prices began to increase in the U.S., the total cost for NCSM\\'s pinpoint job has increased in some cases. As a result, the trend towards longer and more complex wells has resulted in selling more sliding sleeves or composite frac plugs per well on average. As the headwinds in completions job continue, NCSM is looking increasingly towards its well construction tools. The management commented in the Q3 earnings call: \"So, we\\'ve had well construction products for a number of years. We developed the AirLock product line, we developed a liner hanger product line, we have the toe sleeves, but it hasn\\'t been a really big focus for us. So, over the last few months what we\\'ve done is, we have put together a well construction group in the company and we put additional focus on it, we\\'ve got dedicated sales support now and we are looking beyond just the U.S. markets.\" NCSM\\'s international market: In Q3 2018, NCSM generated 12% of its revenues from the global markets, which was significantly higher than the 4% share in Q2. The company delivered NCS products for an upcoming trial in the Middle East. This marks its first work in the Middle East. However, NCSM\\'s management estimates 4Q 2018 international revenue to be between $3 million and $4 million, which would be a 50% decline compared to Q3. In August, NCSM signed a contract agreement with Aker BP - one of the largest oil and gas companies in Europe by revenues. The five-year deal pertains to well-stimulation services. Work under the contract is subject to individual purchase orders. Read more on the acquisition as well as a detailed analysis of NCSM here. NCSM\\'s debt and cash flow NCSM\\'s long-term debt increased on September 30, 2018, compared to what was at the beginning of the year. Earlier, in May 2017, NCSM issued a public offering and raised $149 million. It repaid a significant part of its long-term debt from the IPO proceeds. Its net debt was negative as of September 30 as a result of cash & equivalents exceeding total debt. NCSM\\'s negative net debt implies it has more cash than it owes, which is typically a sign of financial strength and stability.\\n NCSM has $20.4 million of long-term debt repayment scheduled in 2019-21. Free cash flow was negative in the past four quarters until Q3 2018. The company plans to incur ~$13 million-$16 million in capex in FY2018. It had cash and cash equivalents of $27.4 million. Plus, it has $55 million available as of September 30 under the revolving credit facility. With sufficient liquidity, meeting contractual obligations and the capex should not be difficult for NCSM in the short-term. What does NCSM\\'s relative valuation say? \\n\\n NCS Multistage Holdings is currently trading at an EV-to-adjusted EBITDA multiple of 6.5x. Based on sell-side analysts\\' EBITDA estimates in the next four quarters, NCSM\\'s forward EV/EBITDA multiple is 6.4x. Between Q2 2017 and Q3 2018, the average EV/EBITDA multiple was 30.1x. So, NCSM is currently trading at a steep discount to its past seven-quarter average. NCSM\\'s forward EV-to-EBITDA multiple contraction versus its adjusted trailing twelve-month EV/EBITDA is less steep than the industry peers\\' average multiple compression. This is because I expect NCSM\\'s EBITDA to improve less steeply compared to the rise in the peers\\' average in the next four quarters. This would typically reflect in a lower current EV/EBITDA multiple compared to the peers\\' average. NCSM\\'s TTM EV/EBITDA multiple is lower than its peers\\' (NINE, SLB, and SPN) average of 7.4x. For the table above, I have used sell-side analysts\\' estimates provided by Thomson Reuters. Analysts\\' rating on NCSM \\n\\n\\n According to data provided by Seeking Alpha, four sell-side analysts rated NCSM a \"buy\" in December, while four recommended a \"hold\". The analysts\\' consensus target price for NCSM is $9.1, which at NCSM\\'s current price yields ~79% returns. What\\'s the take on NCSM? Canada, which continues to be a significant part of its portfolio, faces industry headwinds. The Western Canada-WTI crude price differentials continue to cause a lower profit margin for the Canadian oil producers, which adversely affects OFS companies\\' growth potential. Plus, lower spot prices and stiff competition from peers offering alternative techniques are keeping NCSM\\'s pricing low. New and improved drilling techniques in the U.S. unconventional resource shales now drive NCSM. The Aker BP contract reached in August is also likely to boost NCSM. I don\\'t expect NCSM\\'s performance to swing upwards in the short-term. But its innovative product churn will gather higher price realization once the current negative drivers recede. That should drive NCSM higher in the medium- to long-term.\\nDisclosure: I/we have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.
